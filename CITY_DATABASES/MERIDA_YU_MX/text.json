          "I enjoyed walking through here several times. You get to watch life happen by all ages of locals as well as some tourists, but not an overwhelming number of tourists",
          "Plaza Grande is a park with shops and restaurants all around it, and a lovely hotel. I go there often when they close the street to traffic on Friday and Saturday evenings, to look in the shops, have a meal and then sit in the park. It's in the middle of everything you need to",
          "In Merida's typical hot weather, it is relaxing to get a shoe shine and watch the crowds. You will have people try to sell you handicrafts, but that could be fun, too. On Sundays, the entire plaza is full of food and drink stalls and vendors of artesanias.",

          "The activities around the plaza are amazing \u2013 particularly on a Sunday. We went there today and they had a dance folklorico with young people dancing the traditional way in the square. It was a Mexican party and viewing and entertainment was free. The plaza had multitudes of",

          "As every city in Mexico in the meddle of the city a church pr cathedral and a park. Always crowded and sometime they have free or charge cultural events featuring dances and other local art.",
          "Out of all the plazas with parks and cathedrals on them that we have visited throughout Latin America and Europe, this is by far our favorite one. It is not too big and not too small. It is wonderfully landscaped with enough trees to provide for lots of greenery and shade. The",
          "Stopped and sat here for a few minutes whilst on a walk , sat on a bench amongst the greenery and watched the locals going by. Not your usual square ... lacking cafes and bars , just a few shops and tour operators . Don\u2019t go out of your way to visit it!",
          "Music, dancing, stages are well organized everyday here. Free Wifi is covered throughout the park. Close to bus terminal. Fantastic!",

          "Catedral San Ildefonso: Sometimes an old church is like a billboard. In this case, take a look at the top to see when it was founded\u2014when the Spanish arrived. Here, they disassembled a Mayan pyramid and used the blocks to build their church. La Casa de Montejo: On an adjoining",
          "Second best plaza in Merida. The nicer, for restaurants and sitting around, is Parque Santa Lucia, a few blocks north.",

          "Merida\u2019s big shopping mall. It has all the normal stuff and you\u2019ll find an excellent Cinema and Sanbourns. The only one in Merida. About 100 pesos to Downtown from there. Plenty of taxis to be found",
          "Being from Latin America, I traveled back in my memories when, as a child, I visited small towns with the same type of square, where locals meet, people sell their products/food, and you see all types of art, performances, and shows. At night, the square is quite lively, with",

          "Lots of stuff for visitors to look at. Governors mansion with the paintings to the Montejo family home with decorative entrance. Buggy rides - at least the horses look fed. Busy, noisy, hot and crowded. Small shop on western side with Maya homecrafts. Some shady areas in the",

          "A wonderful way to spend a morning! Centred around the main square Merida Domingo has everything one could want for a cultural experience. I sat on a bench near the main cathedral and enjoy the music coming from the morning service. I did move down the way for a fresh fruit",

          "The Grand Plaza is Merida, filled with people each day and all hours of the day. This is a vibrant city. Each day you will see something different. When you see these odd chairs that face each other, you will quickly see that all are being used. Imagine, actually talking to",
          "The plaza is georgous, with the M\u00e9rida sign in the middle, the stone chairs to talk and bench, very good looking trees and nice buildings all round the place. Even at night it is really the heart of the city. Small businesses are located all around it and in the streets nearby.",

          "Expecting a main plaza in Mexico to be like Puebla\u2019s or San Miguel de Allende\u2019s, this one was a bust for me. Not a lot going on except constant constant traffic. While there are some vendor and restaurants I wouldn\u2019t describe it as an evening place most tourists and locals would",
          "A must go if you are here on a Sunday. Many, many merchants with local goods and food. A huge square in front of the museum is reserved for entertainment. Their was as much locals as travelers.",
          "Beautiful main square in a lovely city. Loads of great shopping and several beautiful churches. On Saturday traffic was blocked and the square was filled with vendors, to include food. That was also the most crowded day but worth seeing. Walk a few blocks in any direction and be",

          "The Spanish colonizers take 1542 as the founding year of Merida. Yet it was a major Maya city before. The cathedral stands, roughly, where the main temple pyramid had been before. Consequently, tourism brochures also claim that Merida is thew oldest continuously inhabited city",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo. Next to the Municipal Palace in the Plaza Grande.\nCasa de la Cultura del Mayab, the Casa de Artesan\u00edas (house of handcrafts) resides there.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.  It joins M\u00e9rida with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Valladolid and ultimately Canc\u00fan.\nM\u00e9rida-Tizim\u00edn (Federal 176) connects M\u00e9rida with Tizim\u00edn (2nd. largest city in Yucat\u00e1n).\nM\u00e9rida-Teabo-Peto known as Mundo Maya Road Carretera del Mundo Maya, its utilized in both \"convent route\" Ruta de los Conventos, and linking the ancient maya city of Mayap\u00e1n and Chetumal, state capitol of Quintana Roo\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

          "We left this museum for the last day of our visit to Merida, such a shame. This is a super interactive museum, with presentation rooms and A LOT to see. Its a bit far from the center but worth the taxi/uber ride.",
          "This was the first museum I visited in Merida before going out to Chichen Itza, Uxmal and Kabah. I had to take a cab from my hotel in the center and takes about 20 minutes driving from the center. It gives a detailed explanation of Mayan life and I found it very interactive.",
          "This is a really wonderful museum, which should come as no surprise - Mexican anthropological museums are uniformly great. Displays are beautifully and evocatively executed. Want to know more? Just open a drawer below the display and you'll be presented with more objects than",
          "This museum had a remarkably thorough history of the Mayan civilization before, during, and after the arrival of the Spanish. There is a wealth of knowledge of the culture, science, language and people of the Mayan civilization.",
          "You might need to get a cab to get here, but the museum is excellent, with exhibit descriptions in three languages (Maya, Spanish and English). My only complaint: The museum is large enough for a cafe on the premises, which it doesn't have.",
          "Such a shame!! They make most of their food from scratch and is a typical Yucatan Mexican food which os not bad. Although there are better places in Merida to try local or regional plates. The problem here is the service, which is TERRIBLE !! and there is a waiters",
          "This is a wonderful museum in Merida that is devoted to the Mayan culture. You can learn quite a lot from this museum. I would suggest you visit some of the Mayan ruins in Uxmal, Dzibilchaltun, Mayapan, Chichen Itza and many other locations. Visiting the ruins gives you an idea",
          "A couple of corrections to some of the reviews I read prior to going. 1) much of the signage is also in English for the main portion of the museum. 2) you don\u2019t need a guide for this to understand 3) It is cheap at $150 pesos for a traveller from abroad What I absolutely agree",
          "Easy and shaded parking under the building. Quick walk up to the ticket/entry. Staff keep the place absolutely spotless and help visitors find their next direction. The signs were in Spanish and English, and each display was well marked. One thing they could improve is the",
          "Excellent museum, well done and well worth your visit. I think this museum has been significantly improved over the years and added to. A very well done tribute to Mayan history and the Mayan people.",
          "This museum was very informative about ancient Maya ruins, but also more contemporary aspects of Maya life. It is worth the taxi/uber ride",
          "Such an amazing museum, it's hard to give it a worthy review. Just check their website for pics and details. It's truly amazing. If you've never been to Yucat\u00e1n and are interested in the history, make this your first stop to give everything else you see the proper context.",
          "A beautiful building, well laid out exhibits, very informative. A bus ride from Centro, in the north. Air conditioning is working overtime, so bring a sweater!",
          "A worthwhile introduction into Mayan history depicting the colonial invasion (what else is new) of European culture and the importance of corn. While many exhibits were in 3 languages, the lack of English on some of them was disappointing.",

          "Housed (sort of) in a distinctive building, the exhibit (all on one level)begins with a temporary show on the importance of corn in Maya culture. Several galleries e.g. Maya world view, Mayans today, then lead up to a superb collection of ancient Mayan artifacts. There are some",

          "If you are into Mayan history, culture, and language, this museum is a must see while in Merida. It is first rate in my opinion not only with the quality but the quantity of exhibits. Very logical layout of great artifacts and thorough explanations in Spanish, English and",

It\u2019s also way out of town. Not an easy access for tourists. The inside of the building is quite... sober,linear. I",
          "We really Loved the museum and hired a guide there. It was fun and he answered all our questions. Took his time and we even taught him a thing or to. Very inspirational tour for us. I highly recommend this on your visit to Merida. A not to be missed.Lots of fabulous archeology",

          "Really good museum. Set out well with interactive displays. Gained a really good understanding of the history as well as the current situation. Suggest you need at least 2 hours to enjoy it well and not rush. Beautifu building as well.",
          "I liked the facts from real time maya culture to ancient. Nice to know about the customs and life of mayans through the century. Very good guide.",
          "I would have probably enjoyed the museum on its own, but it really left a mark because of a Spanish-language tour that was offered at 1 PM on the day of my visit. The guide was thorough, enthusiastic, and made walking through after the fact almost pointless because he'd already",
          "We visited here in December, and spent an entertaining two hours viewing the excellent exhibitions. We got there on a collective van, picked up just round the corner from the main square - fare was 8 pesos each - and we waved down a return van from the layby outside the museum.",
          "My husband and I were lucky to catch a very informative and super entertaining guided tour of the museum. Hugo was so knowledge able and entertaining, he made Mayan culture and the history of Yucatan come alive!. However, even if you don't have a guide, this museum.is very well",
          "The museum is done beautifully but English translation isn't consistent. Many displays do don't have English explanations. All videos and interactive games are in Spanish without translation. There is no WiFi so I couldn't even have google translate. I felt unwelcomed. It is a",
          "Well worth a visit, especially if you can go before visiting any of the old Mayan city sites. Well curated. You move through the museum starting in the present and moving gradually further back into the past, which is a bit odd when you first notice it but actually really",
          "Really enjoyed my visit and while I had some misgivings initially about the fact that it is organized from current time backwards to the ancient times, I left thinking that was a good idea as the best, at least for me, came last and left me with positive feelings. At 150 pesos,",

          "Our experience at the Gran Museo was fantastic. We had our three children (2, 5, and 8) with us. There were very unique dioramas to look at, life size reconstructions of Mayan temples, and the floors have glass cutouts where you can look at topographic maps of Mayan villages.",
          "This is a good starting point to understand de Mayan culture. The building is beautiful and the museum is well thought out and basic with the entry level information for any tourist to dive into the Mayan culture",

          "As someone who plans most trips around museums, history and culture the Grand Museo was a huge disappointment. If it's the only museum you've visited about the Mayans I could see getting something out of it but we really didn't. The building itself is fantastic from the",
          "This museum is a bit imposing in its' comprehensive (almost encyclopedic) take on Mayan history. Firstly, the admission price is twice the cost of the best museums encountered during my travels. Secondly, there were not enough instructions in English to satisfy the non Spanish",
          "Attention Open on Monday and closed on Tuesday. Beautiful modern building. Good presentation of Mayan culture. I found the descriptive tags placed too low and lacking contrast. Found them illegible. Maybe my old eyes? Also,no cafeteria!",
          "If you're interested in the history of the Mayans you must visit this museum. The Mexican government have spent an awful lot of money on this building and their pride in the history of this part of Mexico is superb. I did think, towards the end of the display cabinets that they",

          "We visited this museum after trekking through Mayan ruins across southern Mexico (Palenque, Tulum, Chichen-Itza, etc.), and it was the best ending to our Maya circuit. When you visit the ruins, you don't get the most from your visit (even if you use a guide) because you tend to",

          "You cannot miss this one. This museum has one of the best museography for an historical and cultural place like Yucat\u00e1n. They combine a marvelously collection of Maya artifacts, together with an interactive collection of screens and games to understand the meaning of mayan",

          "This museum deserves to be considered among the best of the country. It can be visited in one hour or an hour and a half, but its design, inner beauty and order makes you want to return a couple of times more.",
          "Travelled to here by local bus which seemed to amuse the other travelers. 8 pesos per journey is an absolute bargain, plus you see more of the city. We were advised centre rear seats are wet due to overhead air con. Told us when we were near the museum, bless them. It\u2019s looks",
          "Great new modern museum. Very informative. The interactive exhibits were a lot of fun! Most exhibits had Spanish, Mayan and English, but the films did not so they were hard to follow. All in all a great day to spend an afternoon!",
          "This was only ok. I thought it took a long time to get there via taxi due to it's location out of town. There is nothing picturesque out there except perhaps a costco or supermarket. The museum had a decent amount of artifacts, but I honest thought the anthropology museum in",

          "Very interesting museum that will give you insight into how the Maya lived. The exhibits are well done, in Spanish and English.",
          "This is a great museum to spend a few hours out of the blazing hot sun. And if you're in the Yucatan, you really should visit the museum and learn about the Mayan culture. Lots of great exhibits, including authentic artifacts, drawings, and reconstructions.",

          "Amazing museum! It didn't spend as much time on pyramids and building construction as other museums, which was fine as we had seen that. It covered so much history and culture - Mesoamerica, to the conquistadors, to current times. It was all presented in a very interesting,",
          "Everyone should visit here before trekking to the Maya sites. It contains an incredible number of Mayan artifacts beautifully displayed in a spectacular building. Our only complaint is the lack identifications on many of the pieces-hopefully that will come. Some visitors",
          "Very nice experience, far better than the anthropology museum in town. Exhibits are clear and explanations are often in English. The building is modern, bathrooms clean. Parking is under the building. Good competence here.",
          "This museum is worth an hour visit, reasonable priced at 150 pesos. They have some Mayan pieces that I have not seen elsewhere. Not crowded and on one floor, so very accessible. This museum is a little far from downtown but only a 80 peso Uber ride.",
          "This museum is considerably underrated but definitely worth spending an afternoon. There are many items of cultural and historical importance and there is a wealth of information about the Maya in general. There are many informational videos and plenty of things to see,",

          "We totally recommend this museum. It gave us a very good overview of the history of the region, the quest for Maya independence and the colonial experience. Not all the panels were in English, but enough. They were also in the Maya language. We had a decent lunch in the museum",
          "There is a lot to see--and to read--at this museum. Give yourself the time to enjoy. The Maya presence in the Yucatan was so important, it is great to understand more about it. This is a very modern museum with lots of interactive touches.",
          "This was a great museum to visit and I would recommend it after visiting different Mayan sites such as Chichen Itza and Uxmal. This museum will help to make those site visits more meaningful. Cool building which is at a distance from the Merida central plaza, but one can",

          "Unfortunately this museum hasn't even gotten close to our expectations. It was by far the most expensive museum we have been to during our mexican travels and I don't see a reason for that. It is a decent intro into the mayan civilisation and culture but in my believe it could",
          "What a surprise to find such an amazing Museum in Merida. The exhibits we're in English and Spanish and Mayan and many more Interactive. Just going through one section of the museum provided valuable information on the Mayan culture, religion and customs. The cost of 150 pesos",

          "This museum is housed in a beautiful building. The staff are kind and helpful. Ticket prices are reasonable. Past this it is disappointing in substance. The displays are mainly tedious descriptions of everyday life and times of the long post-classical Catholic Mayan culture",
          "We were happy to have learned about Mayan tribes, cultures and their stone pyramids at this museum on our first day in Merida. It puts in context what we would see during the next seven days in Merida and the archaeological sites in Uxmal, Chichen Itza, Sayil, Kabah and Izamal.",
          "The car park is under this building, when we arrived upstairs we found the museum in a block nothing to do with the nest structure! A small cue for the ticket office but was huge when we came out. Then we had to cue for a video in a round pad, all in Spanish, NO subtitles but",

          "This museum was especially great after having gone to Ek Balam and Chichen Itza in the past few days. For English speaking visitors - Staff does not speak English but you can figure out where to go if you don't speak Spanish. Many exhibits had explanations in English.",
          "Modern, interactive museum on Mayan Culture. Less on archaeological aspect but more on social cultural aspects.",
          "A visit to this museum is a must if you are in Merida. The building itself is quite spectacular. The museum is fabulous with really well thought-out displays with explanations in English. The animations were quite beautifully done. After the museum we explored the building and",
          "This museum gives a very comprehensive but time-efficient history (& current situation) of Mayan civilization. To begin with, it was scintillating to realize that we were standing in the same place where Meteor had hit the earth making dinosaurs extinct and made our life",
          "An impressive building, a fine collection of well-displayed Pre-Colombian Mayan artifacts, interesting items from the conquest/colonial period, many charts and interactive tools for providing information... there are many very positive elements of El Gran Museo del Mundo Maya.",
          "Really liked this museam. It had a great replica of the temple of Ek Balam. Nice artifacts. The order was confusing to me because it started with life inception on earth and then to post colonial. I thought I had taken a wrong turn and missed the Mayan part but it was last.",
          "Easy to tour the museum in a few hours. I recommend seeing this museum before you visit the ruins at Uxmal or Chich\u00e9n-Itz\u00e1. Great displays. Be sure to check out the temporary exhibits on the upper floors.",
          "Very nice with lots of Mayan artifacts. Very nice story of how the Mayans lived and how they still live.",
          "Exhibits are posted with adequately detailed information. Staff is helpful. As an archaeologist I recommend a visit. Take the yellow local bus on 58 St behind the cathedral.",
          "Fun and informative. Beautiful museum. We recently moved to Merida from the USA and found the museum really great. Unfortunately, we could not read much of the information provided as most was in Spanish, but we will definitely go back again once we have a better grasp of",
          "We went through this museum backwards, beginning with modern Mayan Culture, careening through the Colonial Period, then ending up with the pre-Columbian artifacts. This approach had its charms, actually, since understanding the influence of the Mayans on today's Mexica informed",
          "When I visited something like 40% of the space was about the meteorite that hit Yucatan 65million years ago and how that relates to the local species, fossils theory of evolution etc. 30% was about modern Mayas ... in the sense they stress that Mayas and the Mayan Civilization",
          "This is a modern and well maintained museum that contains a lot of ehibitions related to the hustory abd culture of Maya civilizations. A fantastic museum that is worth visiting",
          "The spectacular Maya exhibits are located elsewhere (Anthropology Museum in Mexico City among others) and not in this museum. What is more, the few pieces they show here come with descriptions that seem to lack scientific background. So skip this museum and go to the Museo",
          "A wonderful introduction to the origins of the earth and it's beings as well as a good presentation of the development of the culture of the Mayan people.",
          "Hugh space. Seems like lots of wasted space. Empty. Could have many more exhibits etc for such a grand huge space. Outside grand plaza so big and so bright and seems so Overbuilt and wasted $$ on A big space when so many other things in Merida need attention. Seems like",
          "Beautiful and modern museum. Interesting and interactive exhibit. We spent about 2-3 hours here and it's well worth the price. Especially if you're staying in M\u00e9rida multiple days and also visit some of the archaeological sites, it is nice to learn about Mayan culture..",

          "We visited the Gran Museo del Mundo Maya museum with our 3 kids (10,13, 17). The kids remained engaged and interested throughout most of the museum visit. 1-2 hours is really enough time and its not too expensive. Its right across the street from the Hampton Inn and very",
          "Interesting, well laid out history of the Mayan people. Displays were well labelled and informative. The staff was diligent and welcoming while providing direction through the museum.",
          "If you're in to the Mayan culture, this is a lovely place to see a lot of artifacts and the building is stunning. If you're not, it may not be worth the trek out here.",
          "Our hotel concierge suggested this museum as an alternative to the contemporary museum which was closed. We were disappointed only by the an absence of the restaurant where we had hoped to have breakfast. We soon forgot about food and became immersed in the history of the area",
          "Don't miss this it's wonderful. Takes a few hours. If you get hungry there is a snack bar on the 2nd floor that has delicious hand mand sandwiches.",
          "This museum may not be what you expect it to be. It does not focus solely on the pre-columbian Maya civilization but instead it encompasses both ancient, modern and post colonial experience of the Maya people in the Yucatan peninsula. Great exhibits, especially the interactive",
          "If you have visited Mayan ruins, this Museum is a must and provides an escape from the searing heat. For an English speaker it would be nice if everything was translated, or if an English speaking guide or portable audio phones were available. On one side is a nice short bit on",
          "Very impressive architectural structure. The Mayan history and artifacts are numerous and well displayed. Speaking Spanish fluently would make the experience even more enjoyable....there was a good English speaking overview of different timelines of the Mayan era but some of",
          "We drove out to this museum which came recommended. The building is interesting and the two exhibitions are good but not amazing. I found the geological one particular disappointing and somewhat simplistic. I enjoyed the cultural exhibition, for it reminded visitors that",
          "We loved this museum. We took an Uber there and back with no difficulty, as it is definitely not walking distance from the city center. The exhibits are professionally done and nearly everything is translated into three languages: Maya, English, and Spanish. We thought it was a",

          "Those of us who already know about and have visited ancient Maya sites may not find anything new here, but it's still worth exploring, and a definite boon to those who are new to the Maya world. Well designed, dramatic and informative exhibits, easy to understand, most labelled",
          "About a 20 minute (100 pesos) cab ride north if the city it is real easy to find. It\u2019s situated in a beautiful modern building that has lots of open solace and a lovely breeze flows soothingly. The staff are so helpful although English can be limited. The exhibits are well",
          "Really enjoyed our visit here. Remember to bring your ID if you are over 60 for a sizeable discoun on the entry fee. Most displays have English interpretations, and an English speaking museum worker offered to answer any questions, which helped a lot. The signage is very low",
          "This is the only museum you need to see in Merida, and it's about 12 km outside of town. We took a cab and it cost about 80 pesos. The exhibit takes you backwards in time to the classical Mayan period (250-900 AD). There are English descriptions, but it's all a bit confusing",
          "A trip to Merida would not be complete without a visit to the Gran Museo Mundo Maya. For anyone unfamiliar with Mayan history, (and even for those of you who are) a visit here provides so much cultural context for the Yucatan of today and will only enrich your journey through",
          "Priced at 150 pesos, very reasonable and interesting. Located away from the city center. Parking available. Interactive displays which cover the Jurassic period (Maya agnostic in fact) with a then separate display covering the ancient Mayas and struggles with Spanish conquest.",
          "If prehisapnic history interests you this museum has to be on your things to do in Merida. Opened just a few years ago, it a modern well explained museum full of artifacts, pottery, Mayan art, etc. to see",

          "The museum is well worth the time to visit if you are in Merida. It presents the world of the Maya from a cultural perspective but also has a great collection of artifacts. You cannot miss it.",
          "If you like museums as I do, you will want to visit this one. It\u2019s big and covers everything from the formation of the earth and the uniqueness of the Yucatan peninsula to the development of the area and its current state. Plan to spend at least two hours in here. It\u2019s a great",
          "During my staying in Merida I decided to pay visit to this museum and I was really satisfied with the easy way to go around and with all the pieces in exhibition, videos and interactive computer make it easy to comprehend the history of such complex and old race I hope they can",
          "From its stunning exterior to its more than 1,000 artifacts, this is very much a world-class museum celebrating Maya culture. It's worth a visit for some context and an up-close look at some of the fascinating objets d'art before heading out to the archaeological sites. It's",
          "It was a bit disjointed in presentation. There were many interesting and some interactive exhibits. I don\u2019t think I really learned anything new. However, the staff was extremely helpful, very friendly. It took us about an hour to go through the museum. The thing is you see",
          "We did a self guided tour. Lots to read & learn about. I feel we missed a lot by not getting there in the morning for a guided tour, a lot is lost in self guided. They also have special shows",
          "....A very well done world class museum. If you only have time for one museum in Merida, come here. The museum is Outstanding! There is also a gallererty space on the fourth floor that currently is showing some serious artwork....Picasso, De Kooning, Rufino, and such......well",
          "Museum is beautiful! Interesting and very well attended . Everyone working guides you through. Good way to learn about Maya culture.",
          "This is a really good museum, big, modern and full of interesting history of the Yucatan. Everything is presented in Spanish so if you don't speak Spanish you will be at a disadvantage. Well worth the visit.",
          "Although I think this is a very good museum, it is a little too big and too modern for my taste. It\u2019s a long distance from the Centro Hist\u00f3rico and when you get there, there\u2019s no real restaurant or pleasant area to relax. There\u2019s a snack bar on the second level, but it doesn\u2019t",
          "You could spend days in this museum. We wore out after about 2 1/2 hours, not out of boredom, but from a limit to what we could process. The museum traces Mayan history from pre-classical to the present. It gives insights into how the Mayan culture survived against great odds.",
          "The museum has overall an interesting proposal. It is surely the most important museum of Merida. They could, however, have focused more on the origins of the Mayan People and their differentiated capacity in terms of architecture, mathematics and arts. They invested a lot in",
          "Good museum to visit for an overview of Mayan history. We spent about 2 hours and felt saturated. There are some video presentation in Spanish that we passed on.",
          "This museum is way outside of Centro, but worth the drive and Uber fare. The first floor was okay with temporary exhibits, but the second floor really was great. Much, much info on all aspects of Mayan culture. Was a wonderful afternoon!",
          "Of course this place glorifies the Mayan civilization (or at least what we assume and suppose on how was it), with so much learning and ways to make you understand easily. Not only reading, there are videos and music that makes the visit easier. Even there are some replicas of",
          "Very informative, but short on artifacts compared to many other museums in Mexico. We spent about 2 1/2 hours. A taxi from centro was 100 pesos and 160 to return. If I were short on time time, I could see skipping this museum.",
          "I love this museum. They have beautiful artifacts from around the region and so much more, including large pieces of meteorites. If you're in Merida, this is a must-see!",
          "Although not a big museum is very well displayed. It explains why, how and what happened in Yucatan peninsula. It has history, geological, and zoological point of views. Its architecture is very interesting as well.",
          "This is really the only museum in the city. It has beautiful and interesting content. Very interesting architecture. Would be better if some of the content was in the upper oval structure and not just the main hall. Not much for children.",
          "This is arguably Yucatan's best archaeology museum, yet it has very poor interiors and value. The quality of videos resembles low-quality TVs of older times. The museum exhibits are not well organized so it is easy for visitors to get lost. Still, it has some unique and",
          "Other reviewers are correct that the beginning of the tour starts with a film about the event that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, and though others did not find it relevant, I really enjoyed it. True, it doesn't have much to do with Maya culture or history, but it",
          "We took a change of pace. This museum was really nice. We learned a lot of the Mayan culture past and present and they had some interactive portions.",
          "This museum offers world class interactive displays, many with explanations in English. I would highly recommend a visit here. A minimum of 2 hours is needed.",
          "I read about this museum I. The lonely planet (which helped with my understanding of the layout). It is layer out in chronological order starting with the age of the dinosaurs until the current state of the Mayan population in the Yucat\u00e1n. I can see how the museum could be",
          "The first half of the museum was difficult to get around, bored beyond belief but when it actually got into the history of the Mayans, it came to life and we thoroughly enjoyed it.",
          "Sadly, the museum was closing early with only 1 hour left. Saw only one area, didn\u2019t have a map to know if there was more or where. Snack bar hidden on 2nd floor \u2014 inconvenient when escalators were shut down and water was badly needed. Gift shop close.",
          "I enjoyed best hr first part, they show a video on how a meteorite collided with the Earth, killing all dinosaurs. It crashed in the Yucatan peninsula. Very child oriented, and the exhibit on how the planet evolved very entertaining. The the maya world, so many figures, and",
          "The exhibits are well done, with good information and interactive elements to keep younger kids engaged. The only downside is the exhibit is a bit hard to follow because the chronology doesn\u2019t make sense (at least to us it didn\u2019t) and it was therefore hard to truly grasp the",
          "This fairly new (6 years old) museum offers an in depth experience in the Mayan culture both ancient and new and the many forces that have shaped it over the centuries. Beautifully curated with signs in English. Spanish and Mayan. If you are touring the Yucat\u00e1n for Mayan",
          "We enjoyed the Museum and was very impressed that there was so many old artifact here. I thought there was a lot of gold, but only found two small pieces. there is some art at the entrance and a exhibition about the dinosaurs.",
          "The museums exhibition covers the full Mayan history from ancient times to the present. We found the exhibition to give a good overview of the history and etnology of the Mayan, though lacking a bit in depth. The parts about life under spanish colonialization and everyday life",
          "We are so happy with our visit, so much information is available in English. We tend to visit museums in Europe and many do not have English information or the translation is very poor. Not the case here. Your travel from current Mayan culture to ancient - fascinating. There is",
          "For an English speaker who's out of middle school, I don't know how much you get out of this. Cool video exhibits, but since almost everything on display is a replica, I feel like 90% of what I learned was from reading paragraphs, not seeing objects, which makes me feel that the",
          "It's a great museum, no doubt. But it's a museum of the whole history of Earth. If you're interested only in Maya section, ask the guard and they'll direct you.",
          "A very good museum Looks cool on the outside and traces the maya from the begging. The short video is in Spanish but you get the meaning Each exhibit tells the story in Spanish and Mayan and English. I throughly enjoyed it. You can take pictures and they do have guards who",
          "All of the exhibits were very interesting; some were in English. Many interactive exhibits gave you more information with the touch of a finger.",
          "Not only will you learn about aspects of Mayan ruins\u2014 what periods, ball court variations, glyphs, examples of key pieces, you will learn history of Mayans, their discoveries, how they were persecuted, uprisings\u2014 but how each state has particular clothing. Lots of great",
          "The best part about this museum for me was the art exhibition at the beginning. Then came the blurry video, which the music was so loud I couldn't understand the words... I speak Spanish but it was still difficult to understand and no subtitles for English speakers. Most people",
          "great museum it was pricey but had a lot to offer for both kids and adults. kids will be thrilled when they see the dinosaurs. They show you were the meteor hit in Yucatan that wipe all the dinosaurs. It will take you around a good hour to see it",
          "Interesting museum. A little way out of central M\u00e9rida, but easily reachable in a taxi (around 80-100 pesos) or bus (8 pesos). Firstly, the building is GORGEOUS. The exhibits themselves were really well done, and perfect prep if you\u2019re planning on visiting Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Uxmal",
          "Great museum with a lot of information! Most of it has information in English but not the short videos! Anthropology, science, history, art, culture! Everything is well put together! A little confusing to find where to buy your tickets and entrance! There is always a security",
          "Other than a technologically flawed introductory video the museum provides a thorough experience not only of Mayan culture, but of the geological, anthropological and scientific forces that brought the region into being and shaped the Mayan people and culture. Fascinating!",
          "We visited with our 9 yr old daughter this week, during a free entrance promotion. Was a nice break from the heat and did have some nice exhibits, however if we had paid the $150 peso/person entrance fee I may have been disappointed.",
          "Actually the building is a nice architectural example. The exhibits of history of the Maya culture are \"helped\" by a part of the rooms dedicated to the asteroid colliding with the earth 65 something years ago. I couldn't understand the relation. Anyway there is an extensive",
          "The building is beautiful, but the exhibits are poorly conceived. You go backwards in time rather than forwards; many exhibits aren't translated into English; and the history of Mayan civilization has been \"sanitized\" for political correctness by omitting such things as human",
          "This is an impressively designed museum, with a lot of imagination given to local visitors. However, the narrative about the Mayan world seems at times too simplistic. If you want to find a discussion regarding human sacrifice, violence, the role of women - don't look here. And",
          "A very modern way to tell you how Maya culture goes into our daily life! Some interactive games make the process so funny!",
          "Some very interesting displays about Mayan culture. A few of the sections were just okay to me however there were some sections that dealt with the Mayan people and structures that were excellent. It is a nice enough way to pass a few hours while in Merida.",
          "So glad this museum exists! A great place to see Mayan artifacts and historical in one place. The only part that was not so great was the small movie theatre type presentations. The first one about dinosaurs was too loud and was awkward to watch. The other exhibits were",
          "When you look from the outside looks vey big but once you're in is not that big. Somewhat pricey but it is worth. You can see here movies about the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs, when we went inside the projection was not very good. If you don't speak Spanish one bad thing",
          "Your tour of the museum starts with a video describing the big bang when the meteor fell on Chixulub and wiped out the dinosaurs. It is in Spanish but you get the drift. From there you wander through the centuries of time to see where the Mayan people came from and how things",
          "We've visited here twice. First, during the pre-opening weekend, then second a year later after it opened. The facility is beautiful. The museum has plenty to see and learn for everyone. It is very clean and well manicured. The price is affordable. It has handicapped access. It",
          "Really nice and new museum. Lots of information and well build up. Could use some more English explanation on some items though. Also the diffirent rooms are not easily understood we noticed. Would advice to go there.",
          "This museum is not very well signed posted and we were a bit confused as to where to go logically from room to another. It's small but there are enough Mayan artifacts to see but that's about it.",
          "The free opera projections at the museo are a gem. The museum itself is great and the seasonal exhibits very informative. Great place to spend the day",
          "This museum is designed to appeal to entire families. They have excellent collections, nicely displayed. The labels are in Spanish, English, and a Mayan language. The only thing I would have appreciated is more detailed labels. Instead of just Mayan objects, they could have",
          "You park underground and take the elevator or stairs to the first floor, where you buy your ticket. The whole museum is on that floor, where you start off with a video (in Spanish) about the meteor that hit the Yucatan peninsula, then enter a room detailing the dinosaur era. You",
          "We were in Progreso and Merida for the month of Feb and a visit to the Mundo Maya museum was on the top of our must see list. It was well worth the visit. Learning about the Mayan culture, the Spanish influence and life of the Mayan people just made us appreciate this amazing",
          "The museum is a little out of the way (you need to go by car or taxi) but it is certainly worth a visit. The building's architecture is beautiful and modern. The museum is nice, varied (objects exposed, small films with explanations, interactive screens) and quiet. The only",

          "The museum experience starts with a movie that is very difficult to see due to poor lighting (perhaps the bulb was dying when we were there) and is very loud. It doesn't have anything to do with the Maya, and the first exhibit doesn't either (it is about the origins of the",

          "As a non local you are charged 3 times the price a local person pays... This is pure discrimination. All of the movies are in Spanish. The staff at the information center there could not speak a world of English. I don't think it was worth $ 150 per person!",
          "A bit out of town soon around 100 pesos each way (the taxis had meters) by taxi plus entrance fee. Introductory film in Spanish only then a strange section on dinosaurs. We rattled through that to the Mayan section. Interesting and well laid out. Lots to see. There is a",

          "At the beginning of the Mundo Maya, we saw exhibits that did not seem to fit in a museum about the Maya. There was a lot about animals and about the meteor strike in pre-history that created all the cenotes in the Yucatan. Then there was stuff about the Maya and the Spaniards,",
          "We loved our visit to the Gran Museo - even just to escape the heat for the early afternoon. It's not a super large museum by international standards, but has some interesting exibits on both Mayan life in recent past and long ago. Getting there is bit of a pain - the bus",

          "The museum has videos in all exhibits to explain the history. It was fabulous, very well done. Can't wait to visit again!",
          "First the architecture of this building is very contemporary and interesting. The exhibits have written explanations in English and give a very good overview of the culture. I especially enjoyed seeing the traditional clothing, especially wedding dress, but this museum has",

          "In summary excellent experience. There are different points of view why I consider this museum as most visit: 1) this is a new museum, so all the facilities are just excellent and with latest technology. 2) service and attention is very good from people working on the museum",
          "The museum goes through the history of the Mayan people primarily from the Yucat\u00e1n region. There is a lot of information available so one can definitely spend a few hours absorbing the details. Most of the information is available in both Spanish and English, which is very nice,",
          "If you are in Merida and have the Mayan History on your radar, this is a spot that you want to hit. Beautiful edificio! Professional service and treatment. We saw the temporary Chixclub exhibit first. Very interesting and fascinating time. There is a mall near here...Gran Plaza",

          "It is a rather big museum, but I could not get into it. the first part of the display had nothing to do with the Mayas which I found disappointing. Don't know why , but I expected something more. It was nicely organized & also with mostly English description.n The museum is",
          "It costs 150 pesos per person. Very clean and new. Great exhibitions with some interactive displays. Present and past Mayan history. Good information about what and why...not just stating the artefact. Cafe was disappointing but on the 2nd floor it's out of the way and seldom",

          "Really good museum which took us over three hours to see! Very interesting place that exhibits the mayan history and present, most information is in English also. There is a parking hall under the museum.",
          "slightly off centre but holding some wonderful artifacts. Covers social history as well as the artistic developments. Signs are in english and spanish",
          "One of the best curated anthropology museums I have seen, and I'm an anthropologist! The various interactive computer slide shows about aspects of Maya history and culture were both engaging and informative, and the displays were very well signed.",
          "This museum provides an overview of the art, history and artifacts of the Mayan and later settlers on the Yucatan region. Some of the displays are excellent although, in my view, the first several rooms featuring the dinosaurs, Spanish and later history can be skipped. Don't",
          "Even though English explanations are very limited we were still able to take with us a good understanding of the Mayan Culture. Worthwhile too the small show about the big impact when the Meteorit hit Yucat\u00e1n some 65 Miillion years ago...",
          "Could spent a lot of time here.. There was a lot of the information in English..to help guide you thought the early Maya history..through to modern times.. Very well done..terrific lightening..",
          "was ok, there where no major mayan artifacts on display, because most where sent to mexico city. really good ac on a hot afternoon",
          "We loved this museum. Its well organized, very well curated but remember, this is for Mexicans or those fluent in Spanish; there is very little English but still, the cultural aspect of the museum is well worth a visit. From the video about evolution to the dioramas of Mayan",
          "I missed the underground parking so I parked at Costco just 2 minutes away. The staff were amazing and very helpful at this museum. I'd give this museum a 5 but there were still some displays and movies that were only in spanish. The layout is very well done and guides you with",
          "A trip from the great comet strike to current Maya. Divided into three sections. Most signage in both Spanish and English.",
          "We spent a few hours looking at the interesting exhibits. The design of the building is very interesting. Learned alot about the Mayan Culture. You do need time to see the exhibits.",
          "A comprehensive display of Mayan culture through the ages with many stunning and important pieces. The progression goes backwards from today to ancient times which can be a little disorienting. The air conditioning is a little fierce - take a wrap! We were very, very",
          "We walked for miles along the Paseo de Montejo (which itself is interesting) from the centre of Merida before realising this museum is a LONG way out - you need a taxi! This is a world-class museum celebrating Maya culture; the Gran Museo houses a permanent collection of more",
          "I was soooo excited to go see this museum. It looks amazing on the outside and I asked my aunt whom lives there if she could take me so I could learn about the Mayan culture. It is nice to see and like most museums there are a lot of mummies and artifacts. I like their movie",
          "This museum is amazing. It provides an excellent overview of Maya culture. I recommend a visit to absorb the basis of the Maya culture, beautifully illustrated with diagrams and art.",
          "Modern museum that had a lot of Mayan artifacts in a super cool facility. The stairs leading up to the entrance resemble the steps of a Mayan temple which made it pretty cool",
          "For my tastes, a little too long on the prehistory and geology of the world before getting to the Mayan history. With a name like Museo del Mundo Maya, I expected a lot more of Maya items to view. Not so say that what they had on display was not great, beautiful, etc. I",
          "Spectacular new building in the north of the city, with displays illustrating the Maya culture, ancient and modern. It did not die out when the Spanish took over in the sixteenth century and all the emblematic Maya cities were abandoned to become the archaeological sites visited",
          "It's so helpful to have a background on the ancient Mayan culture before visiting the ruins, and this museo provides it!",
          "If you enjoy history you should visit here. It's gives a thorough history of the Spanish and Mayans.",
          "It is a little cheaper for nationals, Museum General admission 150 pesos, Nationals 100 pesos and Yucatecos 50 pesos. Children, seniors, teachers and students 25 pesos. When you first walk in there is a movie playing {all in Espanol}, but if you know a little history you will",
          "Had a rather hurried (2 hour) visit. Main section tells the story of Maya culture & history with displays & explanations. There were some of the original artefacts that one expects to see but not many. Maybe we didn't do it justice but I wouldn't visit again. But nice modern",
          "Beginning with the meteor strike just north of Merida that may have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and the geology of Yucatan, the museum goes on to chronicle the rise and fall of different city states and the arrival of the Spanish with numerous artefacts and copies of",
          "In the northern part of the city, about a 15 minute drive from Centro. It has a great collection and is laid out very well. Very informative and insightful into Mayan culture, how it developed and persisted into the modern era.",
          "This is a very modern up scale museum. It has varied and interesting exhibits, mostly concerning the Mayan culture.",
          "This is well worth the colectivo or taxi ride to the north part of the city. A fasconatong piece of architecture representing a sacred tree of the Maya, it is a thoughtful and beautifully designed museum dedicated to the origins, history, and living culture of the diverse Maya",
          "I was most impressed by this museum's architecture and and its exhibit. A real learning experience for anyone, not just mayas or mexicans. A must if you have an inclination towards pre-columbian civilizations.",
          "This is a new and very impressive museum. We needed to take a taxi from the Centro but it was well worth it. The museum gives an excellent overview of the growth of the Mayan Empire but just as importantly of the lives of the Mayan today in the Yucatan. We live in Washington, DC",
          "Although many feel that it looks like a space-ship, it was designed to resemble a Cieba Tree (the sacred tree of the Maya). The museum has exhibits on geology, culture and the history of the Merida area of the Yucatan Peninsula. The exhibits that were in the INAH museum and",
          "Our family was advised to stop at this museum and we were delightfully pleased with all the information and professional displays. You can easily spend hours here at a fair entry price.",
          "The architecture of this museum is very interesting, the building is cilindrical and covered in green. Inside you can see the history of the Mayan peninsula since the beginning! It begins with a small movie showing the formation of the land, then you walk through several halls",
          "Went here on our last day in Merida and glad we did. Large museum with explanations of Mayan culture and history. If you are planning to see the ruins, stop by as it will give you a good background into what you're looking at. Good mini plantarium type show about Mayan creation",
          "A great new piece of architecture that houses the 2012 opened museum. Usually one gets bored with being shown the same information over and over. Although you would have seen sections of the information before, the rest of the displays are great, interactive and very",
          "The building itself is incredible and worth seeing. The Maya artifacts are always worth seeing especially if you are into history and culture. The museum is on one floor and pretty spread out so be prepared to walk. There is a special exhibition area that included earth",
          "A friend and I had our wives leave us here while they went on the home tour at the English Library. We spent a couple of hours enjoying everything. It is fantastic and we speak and read no spanish. The only problem when we went was the attached restaurant was closed for an",
          "The Grand Museo is the place to go for M\u00e9rida's most immersive Mayan experience. Not only does the museum have numerous important objects on exhibit, but also there are many interpretive, multi-media displays that help place the viewer directly into the Mayan world and",
          "This is where you learn about the Mayan history and world. It's a relatively small museum. It displays costumes, ceramics, and explains about the cenotes to better understand their importance in the Mayan world.",
          "If you are interested in the Maya and their super advanced (during European dark ages) society, this is a great place to go. We went on day 1.",
          "We went on a rainy day and we absolutely loved it! Great museum, interesting and well done. Lots of interactive activities and videos so great for kids too. It gave us a great understanding of the Mayan culture and I recommend this if you stay few days in Merida.",
          "It's a nice and relatively small museum. It's focused on the Mayan world, costumes, ceramics, the cenotes and helps to better understand their importance in the world.",
          "The museum is a large, modern facility with exhibits that take the visitor from the meteor strike that brought on the ice age through the Mayan civilization and into modern times. Fascinating journey. Plan on at least two hours to take it all in.",
          "Architecture is really cool. Collections seemed repetitive. Expected more for size of museum. Nowhere to eat but a tiny cafe with gas station type food options and Wasn't even open by late morning. $7 USD/adult",
          "Worth to spend and read how the Mayan cukture is still alive on current population on Mexico and how it is merging with western style culture. Excelent visuals, ambience. Do not miss the light and sound show at 7 pm",
          "Nothing authentic about this place, old Museo on Paseo de Montejo was so much better. You can easily skip this visit unless it's on your \"checklist\" that you want completed without fault.",
          "I've visited the museum several times, but this was my first time with a 3 year old nephew who is a fan of dinosaurs as many toddlers are. It made me realize the potential of the museum toward this particular age. The dinosaur section is great but very small and it will be",
          "We went to this museum, 4 adults and two very bright and interested children, aged 4 and 2. They are living in Mexico for 6 months and were enjoying every minute of it, until we got here. It started off with a horrible man on reception who decided he didn't like my daughter",
          "Took the whole family and enjoyed our visit throughly. We learned so much about the Mayan culture/people and about the local topogrphy. Definitely worth a visit, plan on spending a couple of hours.",
          "It costs about 80pesos in a taxi from the Centro. The building itself is very cool to look at. The museum is very good if this interests you. The videos are only available in Spanish. Throughout the museum the descriptions are in Mayan, Spanish and English. You will need to",
          "Went there for half a day nice building and plenty of parking. Went on a Friday and there weren't a lot of people.",
          "It's modern, new. Impeccable facilities. Child friendly. Went along my two toddlers. They were captivated by the interactive features.",
          "After visiting some archeological sites I expected the museum to help me understand better the Mayans. They do have a lot of material, but the idea and way the exhibition is organised doesn't really help. It is still worth a visit, as the building is beautiful and it will help",
          "Gran Mundo Maya is a beautiful tribute to the Mayan people who live over a large area, including the Yucat\u00e1n. The museum excels at providing user friendly exhibits using a variety of media. The videos are particularly vibrant and artistically done. The museum is beautifully",
          "The current exhibit is on the Chicxulub impact crater, left by the asteroid that drove the dinosaurs to extinction 65 million years ago. Very well done. The permanent exhibit on the Maya culture was thorough and informative. There are interactive exhibits (touch screens), rooms",
          "We decided to go to the museum last minute and regretted not having more time to visit properly. Very rich and interesting expo. Fascinating civilization ! Plan a 3 or 4h to visit the place. English is present only 50% of the Time.",
          "The Gran Museo del Mundo Maya is located a long taxi ride from the centre of Merida. My wife and I had been looking forward to getting a primer of Mayan history before going to visit some of the Mayan cities like Chichin Iza and Ek Balam, but the Gran Museo failed to provide",
          "Beautiful architecture, sweet staff, and most importantly pretty educative and didactic. It explains the geology of the Yucatan region that helped shape the Mayan culture. It also offers two 8 minite videos about the Mayan culture. If you have already visited a couple of Mayan",
          "This museum explains you the history and the way mayas watched the world, you can learn different things like how to make a long count serie, like maya did",
          "Good museum to learn about Mayan culture. They have a good mix of content types, there were artifacts, videos, touch screens and written content with information about mayan civilization. They have different interactive screens to engage and teach you about mayan language and",
          "The museum is new and very big with an important collection. It is divided in two with the first part dedicated to the big meteor that hit the peninsula, and the second to the Mayan culture. A nice visit, plan for at least a couple of hours.",
          "I don't understand some of the harsh criticism of this lovely museum, which covers a bit of everything related to this fascinating and historic area of the world. To begin with, the architecture, which is strikingly modern, is actually symbolic of much of Mayan history,",
          "I have had the opportunity to visit several Museums world wide, and some key characteristics I enjoyed in this specifics one: - Architecture of the museum by itself is a modern work of art. - Very direct and straight forward explanation of key milestones. - A nice balance of",
          "What was expected to be a great experience resulted truly disappointing. The permanent collection is really limited. Museography is really poor and the opening video quality is below minimum quality.",
          "This \"museum\" about 8 or so miles from the city center felt like nothing more than a corporate/conglomerate showroom providing a gloss over of Mayan history and culture. It seems to be more of an an add-on to the convention center next door. It's not hard to imagine a municipal",
          "You need two hours to explore this world class museum. Different aspects of Maya culture are covered and for those who speak Spanish there are also numerous excellent informative video rooms. The museum is located about 10 km north of the city centre but is easily reachable by",
          "This museum in a beautiful structure located some distance from the center of town. It is a very large building that really doesn't seem to have that much in it, considering it's size. The exhibits are interesting and well presented. A series of videos tells the story of the",
          "Considering the 150 peso fee and the distance of Mundo Maya from town, I didn't find the museum to be worth the price or effort to get there. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I was really hoping for the museum to tie together all I had learnt from my visits to the",
          "The building is amazing. The museum has a lot of interactive things to interest you and keep you busy. However I was disappointed because of the lack of authentic stuff. One would expect in Merida to have a plethora of artifacts. They must have taken them all to Mexico City!",
          "Worth the trip out to this museum. We found it easy enough to to go by Collectivo. Whilst the videos are in Espanol there is lots of info in English. Some amazing artefacts. A great place to get an insight into the Mayan culture.",
          "This museum opened a couple of years ago in a beautiful new building next to Costco on the outskirts of Merida. There were more staff than visitors the day we went. The labels, in Spanish, Mayan, and English, were informative and frequently interactive. Several videos punctuated",
          "This is a long cab ride from Centro storico A very modern structure finished in 2012 houses an amazing series of exhibits on the amazing story of the Mayans- a remarkable race who were so very advanced in many aspects of civilization. Worth that long ride to visit",
          "This museum has really interesting pieces of the mayan culture. The buikding by itself is a piece of art. I recommend it",
          "Exploring the Maya world and history through a very well organized museum. It is worth visiting. The cost is affordable and they have some discounts for students, professors and elders.",
          "If you want to know more about the history of the Mayas this place is a must. Bring your family here before traveling to any park so that they are informed about the history of Yucatan and the Mayas. This is a very nice place, modern, and the people are very friendly.",
          "From the outside, this museum is a stunning work of architecture! Worth the trip to see the building. The museum itself showcases Mayan artifacts and gives a detailed account of Mayan history and customs. Our visit was a pleasant educational experience.",
          "Stopped On out way out with our 5 year old. Not suitable for younger than 12 yrs old. Should've brought a drawing pad to keep him busy while we read all the information. About a 2 hour stay, at least",
          "Took a taxi from downtown , 15 minute ride..very modern facility, well organised with a lift from the street level....you can two hours here easily.... There is a small cafe upstairs with very limited food options..",
          "As is so often the case with history exhibits here, this museum makes heavy use of recreated artifacts and often seems to be creatively interpreting them. It doesn't seem to break any new ground in terms of illuminating Mayan history or culture. The introductory section on the",
          "Apparently the collection here was previously in 6 different museums, so our host told us, and was brought together in one place in 2012. The building itself is really impressive, a giant green steel nest. It is airy and cool inside. The exhibits are impressive, and there's a",
          "This museum is worth the ride north from the city centre, just to see the architecture. Like many museums I\u2019ve visited, the building is almost more interesting than the contents. The Mayan artifacts are plentiful, and I learned something about the Mayan culture. If I spoke",
          "You can spend hours there. The exhibits were marked with Spanish, Maya and English descriptions. The light show was quite interesting. It is laid out in a logical way. The artifacts and sculptures were great. It took you from the time of the dinosaurs, through the",
          "This is a good place to go to see artifacts from some of the ruins. We stayed in the Centro and took a taxi to the museum and back",
          "This museum is a brief view of what happened in the Yucatan Peninsula, starting with the extinction of dinosaur by the meteorite in Chicxulub, the life of ancient maya people until the conquist and haciedas henequeneras (green gold); and there are exihibited some pieces of",
          "The museum is located a short taxi ride (about 90 pesos) from the centre of Merida. The building is new, modern and cool inside - a great place to escape the heat on a hot day. There is a 150 peso entry fee for foreigners. When we visited, there was a temporary exhibit on",
          "it just seems to be a place that was built to occupy space or spend a budget, a big one that is, in it...nothing wow about it, on one hand it is interesting some parts are at least....but on the other hand it is too big or extense, not exceptionally good and not really",
          "I visited the museum aiming to know how the Mayan civilization was in origins and the evolution until today. The way the different areas were organized is what made my visit not as enjoyable as I expected. The tour goes from nowadays until the ancient Mayas. I spent much time in",
          "In a beautiful and modern building reminiscent of the Chinese birds nest, is a wonderful museum of the history of the Mayan culture. A fascinating overview of this not so ancient civilization that persists today in the Yucat\u00e1n. I highly recommend a visit. Free entry!",

          "I admit a lot of the museum is in Spanish & Mayan so I did have a hard time understanding the videos and some of the displays but overall it was fascinating to read about the culture. There were many interactive exhibits (in English) so I was able to learn about Mayans and have",
          "Recently opened, this museum shows the amazing Mayan civilization from its origins, its legends and reality, its unique cosmogony. You can appreciate the great wisdom of the people and their harmony with nature. It has magnificent audiovisual supports, many of them interactive",
          "Amazing new museum dedicated to the Maya culture and the natural history of the Yucatan. I suggest going early in the morning, lots of school groups in the afternoon. Great architectural landmark to see, but relatively limited. Worth a visit but not a top priority in Merida.",
          "Very well displayed. World class museum. English descriptions on most exhibits. Definitely worth a visit and appropriate for children.",
          "The entire place is amazingly design to be enjoy many many times. So much information of every single theme; you can do an overlook or be able to investigate more and more. Interactive stations for many tips you could be interested. You can FEEL the history, kindly, at every",
          "One of the best museums in Mexico. Lots of information about the Mayan civilization. It is very kids friendly. Personnel is really friendly and helpful. I visited the museum with my kids, 6 and 4 years old and they both enjoyed it very much. The most important opportunity",
          "At 120 pesos each its very cheap. There are 5 rooms that all have air conditioning as well as guards to show you where to go. There are English translations for most exhibits but the five video presentations are only in Spanish. The museum is a 30 minute bus ride from central",

          "I do recommend a visit to this museum. Only if you have enough time after visiting the city and some of the great archeological sites in Yucatan. I would not put it at the top of my list. While it does make for a nice visit; I would have liked to see more in depth info on the",
          "Despite the spectacular architecture, I found this museum baffling. It's supposed to honor the Mayans and their advanced civilization. However, the first rooms of the museum concern the near-extinction event of the Chicxulub impact. Yes, this is an interesting story, but",

          "We traveled here our first day in Merida. I will tell you that its very hard to find as there are no street signs. Word of advice, it is right next to Costco. It was an informative museum and everything was in both spanish and english. We spent approximately two hours in the",
          "Nice break from the heat! The layout of the museum can be a little bit confusing at first. Guards had to guide us through the entrances so we would follow the right path. Make sure you throw your gum in the garbage before entering. Items displayed are very intersting and even if",
          "Most items in the museum are replicas, although most of the descriptions are thorough. Not very kid friendly.",
          "Gorgeous building, the museum is really good, has many things to see, it starts not only with this culture, it takes you to the prehistorical era of The Yucat\u00e1n pen\u00ednsula, then mayan history, the spanish, and now.",
          "No much to see, disappointed with the volume of displays, very large elaborate building, few visitors there. Staff were great and very knowledgeable, they need to add many more exhibits to attract revisits.",
          "We drove by this museum a few times and always thought the building was so cool and made it a point to come visit before we left Merida. Unfortunately, the only thing that was good about this place was the building itself. Right from the beginning, we were greeted by rude",
          "Very much worth a few hours, the museum presents a chronology of the history and living culture of the Yucatecan Maya. Excellent.",
          "We planned on taking an hour or so to visit this museum, but took much more time. Granted that the artifacts are not the most splendid available, but the way it explains Mayan culture and history is fabulous. And take time for the video on the extinction event, it is well done",
          "I recommend you visit this museum at the start of your visit in Merida, as it provides a good introduction to Maya culture and gives you a good start before visiting archaeological sites. The museum is modern, clean and very straight forward, if you follow instruction form the",
          "Loved Merida!,,the Mayan Mundo museum was a huge bust....the building is out of place but I guess someone's idea of modernism which is out of place in this lovely city....very consuming layout inside with much wasted space...snack bar was totally devoid of food and patrons when",
          "Before the opening of this museum, big expectations were set: \"the biggest, most impressive museum worth to host an exhibit of one of the most important civilizations in the world\". When arriving, as you see a very impressive building, those high expectations are even higher.",
          "This is a fairly small museum, but it is full of great information on the Mayan culture and Mayan history and it has a lot of Mayan artifacts. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Interesting architecture, but if you are looking for Maya artifacts, go to the Palacio Cant\u00f3n, it has a much better collection. This museum is on the way to the ruins at Dzibilchalt\u00fan, so do both things in one day! And have lunch at Hacienda Xcanatun.",
          "Intriguing looking building away from the center of Merida (a quick and cheap cab ride). Nicely organized the way it leads you in a circuit to see all the exhibits; good descriptions in English for those of us lacking proficiency in Spanish. Some very nice and unique pieces,",
          "The new museum in the outskirts of M\u00e9rida with its modern design houses two exhibitions: one on the comet impact 65 million years ago that ended dinosaur life on eurth and the other one on Mayan cultural objects. Both of interest and well documented. A must for if you visited or",
          "The \"story\" for this museum is somewhat disjointed. It introduces itself with the story of the meteor that struck on the Yucatan coast and wiped out the dinosaurs, which seems to mainly serve the purpose of displaying some dinosaur fossils. It then bridges into a collection on",
          "This museum is a real treat and you could spend hours on just one of the sections. Very thoughtful exhibits with many visual cues to improve your understanding of the subject matter. It is outside of the city center but well worth the trip",
          "This museum, as the title suggests, is a good introduction to everything Maya. It starts with the current peoples who comprise the Mayas, and goes from there. I would recommend going here before doing any of the tours to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 or Uxmal. Everything will be in better",
          "This museum has brought together s lot of information about the Mayans. With parking right under the museum makes it easily accessible. Most of the information is in Spanish but a lot is also available in English. There is a mix of short videos and static displays. At the",
          "This 4 year old museum housed I an incredible building explains the history of the Yucatsn, the Mayan people and the Spanish conquerors. Well worth the visit as many of the exhibits have explanations in English as well as Spanish.",
          ".....but well worth a visit. The building is spectacular and we went into the museum with high expectations. We started with a movie about the creation of the planet and went on to see exhibits about the geology of the Yucatan and the catastrophic Chicxulub meteor. This was all",
          "This is a wonderful museum. I was impressed with how beautiful the building is and how friendly and knowledgeable the volunteers are. We had a guide named Hugo who made our entire experience exciting and magical. He was passionate about his job and proud of his culture and it",
          "The Gran Museo del Mondo Maya is a bit of away from central Merida but well worth taking the time to visit. The building is very new and modern, somewhat like the 'Bird's Nest' stadium in Beijing. The principal exhibit covers the Mayan world, starting in the present and moving",
          "The location is far outside central Merida, but easily reachable by a ten-minute taxi ride for about 100 pesos. The building itself is part of the experience; modern bold architecture. The museum is just a few years old. Tickets are surprisingly expensive, 150 pesos per person",
          "I had a wonderful visit to the Gran Museo Mundo Maya. This is a must for anyone interested in learning about the Mayans, whether you know a lot, a little or nothing at all. I did not care much for the introductory video and the first room (both about earth in its early days,",
          "Nice museum. Really in two parts, first covers evolution, second covers the Mayans. Starts off with a short film then you walk thru and see the exhibits. The majority of the exhibits have signs in both English and Spanish. Film was in Spanish only. Inexpensive to get into. Nice",
          "I'd always encourage anyone to visit local museums and learn more about the history of a place, especially somewhere as interesting as the Yucatan. In short, if it's rainy day or you have some time to kill in Merida it's worth checking out. Otherwise I'd recommend visiting some",
          "This is an amazing building, comparable to the Guggenheim. there were some very good artifacts and they were accompanied by plaques with English translations. However, the films were Spanish only. We took about 2 hours. Enjoyed the AC on a hot afternoon.",
          "Good overview of Mayan history including the present time. It is also interactive and children can compare the Mayan andour calendar.",
          "Firstly, don't bother with the cafe - after some searching, we finally found it on the top floor. No sign of a menu so we asked what they had and were offered nachos, sandwiches and paninis. For a museum celebrating all things Maya, this wasn't what we expected! Headed straight",
          "This museum is a perfect example of how a unrealistic idea can actually have a negative impact on presentation. The architecture is truly monumental and at times there seemed to be more security guards than tourist. It also doesn't help that the ticket price for foreigners",
          "This is a beautiful modern building with interesting exhibits about the Mayan culture- its history, culture and traditions. The signage at the museum is poor making it confusing where to go in , and where the exhibits are located. We took a bus from centro to get there.",
          "My wife and I visited midweek so no crowds and we were able to enjoy the displays at a relaxed pace. If you've been to any major museums this will disappoint (sorry). Not much of a variety here and why post religious statues and momentos? Could be a quality attraction with some",
          "Located about 10km outside the town, between large shopping malls. New museum with information about the Maya's in present day and in earlier days. Unfortunately, Some potential interesting information (f.e. About the Maya hieroglyphics and the calender) was Only available in",
          "This beautiful new museum, with many different displays, short films, etc. gives a grand overview of the Maya world from prehistoric to modern times. Many displays give us a peek at everyday living plus the many artifacts show the creativity of their artisans. Some of the",
          "Big place with too little to show. Yes, there are interesting things, about history of the area and people, but it's almost to little for the price and it is hard to find the next area you suppose to view. They almost made this place too Americanized.",
          "This museum focuses on the geological history of the area and its effects. It is well organized and arranged and the exhibits tell several stories about the geological past of the Yucatan. The remarkable thing is that these stories come together in a way that is almost",
          "The museum is a beautiful fairly new building, about 3-4 years old, located 10-15 minutes out of Centro, displays are beautifully presented, some movies in Spanish but you get the gist without the language, some interactive computer screens in Spanish and English. Many of the",
          "All but the short films are in Spanish and English. No where in the Yucatan will you learn more about the Maya. Also visit the Museum of Anthropology on Paseo de Montejo. The latter is not as comprehensive, but it is in an old mansion and it is walkable from the Historico",
          "Before the current museum was built, I had the chance to visit the former one on Paseo de Montejo. Those who visited both will obviously conclude that besides the nice building (looks more than a chiken nest than anything else), it was as if the 'owners' of the museum simply",
          "If you've been to the Anthropology museum in Mexico City, you will find this museum disappointing. It's a huge space they've filled with a lot of panels and what looks like cutouts from books. Not many artifacts. And must have been organized by people who've never been in a",
          "I have traveled through central America & Mexico. Have been to 16 sites to this point. Was hoping for a little more, but maybe that is just because of my past experiences. Odd beginning to the museum as it starts with dinosaurs and the such and it doesn't flow real well,",
          "Lots to see and learn from! A very interesting timeline starting from the prehistoric/dinosaur era to the the Spanish colonization.",
          "Big collection, Well displayed. Most of the signs are in spanish and english. They presented 4 different videos all in spanish which is frustrating but everything else is very informative and interesting. It took us around 3 hours but at the end we rushed through the exhibits",
          "I was surprised but extremely pleased that this museum began with a focus on the natural history of the Yucatan Peninsula. It was an excellent overview and truly set the stage for the overview of Mayan culture. Although I've been very exposed to Mayan culture over the years,",
          "This is one of the most impressive museums I've ever visited. Beautifully designed exhibits are informative with decent amount of English translations (although the visually fabulous videos are only in Spanish). Many historic artifacts, all set in context and explained. We were",
          "I arrived here not really knowing what to expect and I was happily surprised. Really interesting exhibitions and majority of the text was in both Spanish and English which was great. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Very modern, very state of the art, but sadly lacking in a coherent story. I'm sure this is a crowd pleaser, but we were hoping for much more depth.",
          "If you ever go to M\u00e9rida, this place is without a doubt, a must to visit. It's beautiful and it has some really interesting exhibitions.",
          "Impressive! Lots of interactive displays and all information is in Mayan, Spanish, and English. The only part not in English was the 8 minute video that is at the entrance. Still, the video is worth seeing for the imagery.",
          "As its name implies this is a great place to visit. I think it is number one of the Musuems in Merida. It tells the history of the Maya's from the beginning, through the European invasion and occupation to the present. It is an optimistic project as well so it gives a vision",
          "Even our 15 year old boy enjoyed it! The paintings tell such a story. We watched all of the videos and spent a considerable amount of time on each level. The Mayan people are amazing.",
          "First of all let me say we enjoyed the museum very much and would recommend a visit if you are in Merida for more then two days. It's a big place and in my opinion takes a while to see all of it. The only complaint I have is that the price on the site says 100 pesos but at the",
          "While you don't walk from the Zocalo to this stunning museum, it's worth the cab fare. And crazy buses are always around. But do plan on at least a couple of hours. Better yet, plan on two visits\u2014maybe in one day\u2014because there's so much to absorb. If you're like we are, a break",
          "We visited the Gran Museo in Merida and were impressed by the very presence of the structure. Manuevering the interior was not simple as there are very few, if any, signs, although the staff was most helpful in responding to obvious confusion. The exhibits provided an",
          "This museum is one of the best I have visited. It has extensive display and historical collection a must see for those who love history. you will need at least 3 hours to grasp this event. It is located about 20 min. outside the city of Merida if you take the collective or the",
          "There are 2 sections to this museum. The first traces the history of the Yucatan and describes the strike of the huge Chicxulub meteor causing the creator of the Gulf of Mexico. This is an ongoing controversy as to whether this impact caused the demise of the dinosaurs. Google",
          "What a great museum. No flash photos here . Lots of information with each item, some open display and some in displays in the floor and others behind glass cases. Mayan items , dinosaur bones, textiles, paintings, large models of ruins, so much more to see here! 15 pesos worth",
          "This museum is really well done, although it looks bigger on the outside than it really is. The exhibits are in English and Spanish. It takes you from pre-historic through modern times and tells the story of the Mayan people. It is a bit far from centro so we took a cab for",
          "If you are in M\u00e9rida for only a few days I would not recommend this museum. It's a little too pricey compared to what you get. I speak/read not a lot of spanish and most of the interesting maya stuff was only in spanish or mayan, for example the many films that were om display.",
          "This place is extremely informative and well put together. We have been to several museums across South and Central America and this one takes the cake. Comprehensive information about the Mayan history and also other aspects of human evolution. Well worth a visit!",
          "Well worth a visit. The building is truly distinctive and unique. The collection of Mayan artifacts and recreations was impressive. All written signs were in Spanish, Mayan, and English. Videos wereonlyin Spanish.",
          "The exhibit begins with the story of the meteorite which hit near here and may have been the one that obliterated the dinosaurs, its impact was so important. But if you came to see Mayan artefacts and you are a compulsive reader you will be exhausted by the time you get to the",
          "Great place to visit with family and friends! Nice arquitecture and easy access. Loved the exhibits and the video at the beginning of the tour. It'll be nice for kids as well.",
          "This museum is in a new building and the exhibitions are well organized. Highly recommend to visit, you won't be disappointed.",
          "We enjoyed the permanent Maya collection. Most of the displays are labeled in both Spanish and English, but longer discussions did not include English (those tended to be in Spanish and Mayan). And the short movies were only in Spanish. As foreigners who speak only a little",
          "VERY nice people working there. I was disappointed with the quality of the displays. The artifacts were replicas and not the real deal. Strange overbuilt building for the use of a museum. Could have a nice view from the 4th floor if the views were not blocked by the unnecessary",
          "All I have to say is that I took a 10 and a 14 year old promising them that we would only be there for an hour before going ice-skating, and we spent 3.5 hours in the museum. Great collection, interesting videos, many interactive activities. We had the good fortune of seeing the",
          "If you are a real archaeology nut, not your thing. Amateurish, not a lot of stuff there, half was on the creation of the world. Good sized museum but lots of empty or near-empty areas. Difficult to figure out how to get around by yourself - a real lack of signage. Overall, a",
          "This was a decent place. It lists a lot of mayan architecture and artifacts found at Mayan sites. There is some English translations which helps language failures such as myself. The AC is fantastic, on a hot day in Merida that really helps.",
          "Went with friends and had a great time. Everything is very clean and organized. Heard it's not finished but must of the exhibits were interesting and interactive. They take you from the asteroid that crashed in the peninsula until the Mayan culture with movies, representations",
          "This really is an exceptional introduction to the Mayan world. Some of the movies are a bit cheesy, but the narrations, signage, and thoughtfully presented artifacts and replicas keep your attention. There's such a large story to tell, that I found myself doubling back to look",
          "While the building is indeed exciting with extraordinary architecture, the actual exhibition seemed sort of lacking. Artifacts were sparse and many were simply reproductions. Much of the material is in Spanish so if they have an audioguide I'd recommend it for non-spanish",
          "The museum is new, and is next to Grand Plaza shopping center. Good to know if you come with a bus because you can get here. ;-) It is a modern museum, but it's good to have once been there. It offers an inspiring view of the Maya live, but most things are in Spanish.",
          "This museum gives you a knowledge of the Mayan history it sure is a basic go to place to visit. One issue is that there's no hand bags (like school bags )allow. So you ladies have to change purse when you visit.",
          "Was not too much about Maya. Was more about how the earth started and evolution with some history of maya and Spanish conquest. Thought this would be a good museum for children and school groups.",
          "This is a new, modern, high-tech museum that includes at least 8 very thoughtful video viewings related to the period or subject exhibited in each section.",
          "This museum is really beautiful. The displays are very informative. I particularly like those that incorporate film, sounds, and massive structures (you'll know it when you see it). It's an absolutely beautiful collection of Mayan culture.",
          "It is a great overview of Yucatan history. however; most of the artifacts are duplicates. If you are looking for something to do in your spare time, this is a great visit.",
          "I first visited this museum when it first opened (October 2013). It was an enjoyable experience, however there was room for improvement in terms of what exhibits were features. The museum is quite large, but there weren't enough exhibits to fill it. Unfortunately, I didn't make",
          "One of the best museums in Mexico. Very interesting and perfectly organized to understand the Mayan history and traditions.",
          "Great history, they translate most of it in spanish, mayan and english so everyone can understand. The Museum itself is quite amazing, new and has some really excellent artifacts. You wont be disappointed. It was great to explore the ruins first and then go to the Museum after",
          "Great new museum. It has display from the dinosaurs era to the modern Mayan people. By night there is a free light and sound show about the history of Yucatan.",
          "The order of this museum was a bit strange but as for the content, it was excellent. Really helped us to understand the context both of the ruins we visited and also the contemporary Maya culture. Also liked the pre-history section with its proud ownership of the Chicxulub",
          "Here is a place where you can learn all the history of the Maya as well as the meteor and what it did to the world as it was then. So many displays. The museum is well organized and something you can go at your own pace. The people who created this put a lot of thought into",
          "I loved that it wasn't only about Mayan ruins but also about how and why Mayans live today. Take a break from the terrible heat and go to the museum and enjoy the exhibit and the AC.",
          "Interesting displays of early Yucatan, history of Mayan people, crafts and folk art. Museum building seems to be new and is a comfortable place to visit.",
          "It is a great museum. From the outside you will think is not that good but believe me it is great, well put and lots f information and artifacts about the Mayan culture, worth the visit.",
          "This is a spectacular building. The museum itself, though small in content, provides an exhaustive review of the Mayan culture. Exhibits all are presented with Spanish, Maya and English translations. Well worth a visit.",
          "The best museum in Merida to get to know the Maya world. There are currently 2 rooms (room 1 and room 4), the permanent one (room 4) is on the Mayans and the other on the Chicxulub crater in Yucatan which is suggested to be the cause for the extinction of dinosaurs. Most of",
          "We came across the museum completely by accident on our last day in Merida, while were were driving out of town. Apparently this is the new venue for their anthropology museum after the original collection at Palacio Canton has been moved here. This new building is world class",
          "We visited this museum with many children ages 7-15. There is a lot of information in the museum, we were short on time and had to rush through some exhibits. (Plan to stay at least 2 hours). They have a lot of informative videos that are nicely made and very enjoyable! Even for",
          "This museum was built with a creative eye and kids in mind. It was fun for not only me (the anthropologist) but my husband and children (ages 11-17) too. It is artfully crafted- from the exhibits to the digital graphics of videos playing throughout. I love how they used so",
          "Obviously we're not talking about the same quality of a major international city but this museum has a lot to offer. Architecturally, it's very impressive and if you are interested in the history of the Yucatan peninsula and it's Mayan heritage, you need to invest a few hours",
          "At night, 8 pm there is a light show where they explain you the Mayan story... the museum is modern, super nice and the history goes from present time to tha past... so is really interesting g and you can understand much more differ stages of the culture. and you can see still",
          "Our tour was a bit short since we arrived late, almost at 5pm, closing time. Staff were very kind but at the same time clear that the whole tour takes up to two hours. We watched a video about the meteorite that struck near Yucatan Peninsula and tour the hall dedicated to Mayan",
          "If you want to know everything about the evolution of the Mayan world and how it was one of the most amazing civilization for several centuries, you have to visit El Gran Museo del Mundo Maya. It is an educational experience that young and old will enjoy. You will have the",
          "I was very excited to visit this museum to learn a little more about Mayan culture and history. The building was really nice and the architecture was very modern. I went with my study abroad group and we took a guided tour. Our tour guide was too personal and make the group feel",
          "A visit to this beautiful, modern museum is a must when visiting the Yucatan. The exibits will give the viewer a greater appreciation and a deeper understanding of the magnificent Mayan culture of three time periods: ancient, colonial, and modern. The multimedia graphics",

          "We have driven by the Museo since it was being constructed, but never stopped to go inside until yesterday! The architecture is incredible on the outside, but it is what is inside the various rooms which is incredible. Spacious, well laid out, bright and with the major signs in",

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.  It joins M\u00e9rida with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Valladolid and ultimately Canc\u00fan.\nM\u00e9rida-Tizim\u00edn (Federal 176) connects M\u00e9rida with Tizim\u00edn (2nd. largest city in Yucat\u00e1n).\nM\u00e9rida-Teabo-Peto known as Mundo Maya Road Carretera del Mundo Maya, its utilized in both \"convent route\" Ruta de los Conventos, and linking the ancient maya city of Mayap\u00e1n and Chetumal, state capitol of Quintana Roo\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.  It joins M\u00e9rida with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Valladolid and ultimately Canc\u00fan.\nM\u00e9rida-Tizim\u00edn (Federal 176) connects M\u00e9rida with Tizim\u00edn (2nd. largest city in Yucat\u00e1n).\nM\u00e9rida-Teabo-Peto known as Mundo Maya Road Carretera del Mundo Maya, its utilized in both \"convent route\" Ruta de los Conventos, and linking the ancient maya city of Mayap\u00e1n and Chetumal, state capitol of Quintana Roo\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

        "wiki": "Dzibilchalt\u00fan (Yucatec: Ts'\u00edibil Ch\u00e1altun, [d\u0325z\u0325\u02bci\u02d0\u02e7\u02e5bi\u026d t\u0255\u02b0\u0252\u02d0l\u02e6\u02e5tu\u014b]) is a Maya archaeological site in the Mexican state of Yucat\u00e1n, approximately 10 miles (16 km) north of state capital M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n== Location ==\nIn the view of modern researchers, the ancient builders of Dzibilchalt\u00fan may have chosen the site of the city to be as close as possible to the coastal salt-producing region (about 22 km (13.7 mi) away), while still being located on a reasonably fertile and habitable terrain. The region between Dzibilchalt\u00fan and the sea coast is less suitable for human habitation, being either mangrove swamps or bare rock.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe site has been continuously occupied for thousands of years, although it has expanded and contracted from mid-sized city to small town more than once in its long history. It is about 30 minutes north of M\u00e9rida, and about the same distance south of the location of the impact site of the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe most famous structure is the Temple of the Seven Dolls, so named because of seven small effigies found at the site when the temple was discovered under the ruins of a later temple pyramid by archaeologists in the 1950s. On the vernal equinox, the site is crowded by visitors observing the sunrise through the temple's doorways, but there is no archaeological feature marking the observation spot; the relationship of the orientation with the equinoxes is thus highly unlikely. The temple is connected to the rest of the site by a sacbe, or \"white road,\" so-called because they were originally coated with white limestone, built over stone-and-rubble fill.\n\n\n== Surroundings ==\nThe other major feature of Dzibilchalt\u00fan is its cenote, Cenote Xlakah, located around the center of the city's ruins. It is thought that the availability of this source of clean drinking water influenced the builders' choice of the location. Archaeological findings retrieved from the cenote by divers indicate that it was the center of a religious cult. These days the cenote is used as a swimming hole by local residents and tourists year round.\nIn this Cenote, just like the one found in Chichen Itza, a large number of archaeological pieces like carved bones and wooden objects, but mainly vases, have been found. Valuable information about the ancient Mayans who lived near the cenote was found here.Dzibilchalt\u00fan also contains the ruin of a 16th-century Spanish church built at the site after the conquest.\nThe Dzibilchaltun archeological site also includes a visitor center with maps, restrooms and gift shops. The renovated museum housing Mayan artifacts located at the site has re-opened. The museum is closed on Mondays.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Mesoamerican pyramids\nList of sinkholes of Mexico\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDzibilchalt\u00fan Photo Essay\nDzibilchalt\u00fan on the Equinox tips\nDzibilchalt\u00fan on TripAdvisor for ratings and tours",

          "This Mayan Archeological Site has a building that is visited by many people on the equinox, but you can go any day to see it's museum, small Mayan buildings, and a Cenote where you can swim. The Cenote is not as clear as others from the Riviera Maya, but its ok to cool off, just",
          "Make sure you arrive early as we arrived just as they were closing. A Gateman took our money ( correct amount!) And took us in through the side quickly but we didn't see everything and missed the 7 dolls temple. Looked good.... and conveniently near to Merida city.",
          "This isn't one of the bigger ruins sites and for me it was just not that interesting. We were on a guided tour but honestly it was so hot that all we wanted to do was get out of the heat. Also, unlike nice underwater cenotes, the centote here is open air and kinds gross to swim",
          "Our guide had extensive knowledge of the Mayan culture, so he explained everything carefully. It is very hot, so wear light clothes. There a cenote to refresh.",
          "It's easy to find if you drive there. Road signs are good. The site occupies a large area and walking the wide treeless avenue to the Temple of the Dolls from the main complex under the scorching Mexican sun is exhausting so dress accordingly. There's a large, fairly shallow",
          "You can take a handbag in but not a backpack. (But you can check for free) Cenote is beautiful. You have to get changed At the entrance and walk there in your swimsuit!",
          "Lovely ruins that you can wander around and climb on with a nice museum attached. I went to swim in the cenotes, which was good fun and easy to do. The warning is that no backpacks are allowed and this is rigorously enforced even for small day packs, so it\u2019s a bit of a hassle",
          "We decided last minute to to visit this site. We grabbed an Uber and asked him to wait for us. We only wanted to take photos and explored the area for maybe an hour or a bit less. It was not busy at all, just a few couples and families swimming or taking photos. We got many",
          "We took our teen age grandsons to introduce them to the Mayan history and traveling in general, what a great time we had. My grandsons quickly met young Mexicans while swimming in the cenote and spent plenty of time cooling down in the water. NOTE: visit early in the day as the",
          "I had never been on a ruins tour and chose this one because it was the shortest one. I loved that the bus ride wasn't too long, and the tour wasn't too long either! We had a good amount of time at the end to go into the water, a restaurant, or explore more of the ruins. The",
          "Great ruins but we were excited for the denote but it was a little yucky and had tons of mosquitoes.. probably a different time of year would be better.",
          "We did this tour as an excursion from our carnival cruise and had a great time. Our tour guide Adam was top notch and had excellent answers to all of our questions and was loaded with information. Have to say he was best your guide I've dealt with anywhere. The ruins were fun to",
          "I loved this destination, although the sun is scorching here in Merida this place felt amazingly fresh, due to the wind and trees nearby. I liked a lot the sinkhole (cenote), however on Sundays there are a considerable ammount of people. I had a blast with my friends and I",
          "We have been to several other ruins, but this time we got a guide. Julio (July) was great, we did the 45 minute tour. He was very knowledgeable about the area & spoke great English. This place was not as big as some others, but well worth it. You can take (or wear) your swimsuit",
          "We visited on our way to Progreso. It\u2019s a small site but fun to climb around on. It has a beautiful shallow cenote for swimming",
          "This is a 'must see' venture back into history, worth every dollar to get there. The buildings have been splendidly preserved and restored. Our guide was essential to describe everything. Amazing to see how people lived long ago.",
          "Great time and tour great but make sure you bring pesos since they were not taking credit cards when we were there. Paid for the personal tour ($40 US) which was worth it for 1 1/2 hour tour. Loved the center there and was nice to cool off after the tour.",
          "Simple ruins if you compare with the rest around the peninsula. The advantage is that it is very close to Merida and you can also swim in the open cenote",
          "One of my fears in visiting Mayan ruins in the Yucatan is the heat. This one has the reward of a cool, open-air cenote for a wonderful and rewarding swim to conclude your visit. A couple of features worth noting: You can climb the pyramid, and you enter a chamber. In addition,",
          "Ten miles north of Merida, an easy drive (or hired-drive, our choice), is a site that combines a nicely-set, usable cenote and an interesting Mayan archeological site. For two of our foursome, cooling in the cenote pool was the clear highlight of our trip. For me, it was walking",
          "I went twice to this archeological area. The first time some years ago there were a few people around and the cenote was all for my friends and myself. The second time it was last week and the cenote was full of people but still beautiful :) The Casa de las mu\u00f1ecas is a very",
          "I've been to Chichen Itza, Tulum, Uxmal, Ek Balam and Mayapan and loved them all, but this site is unique for 2 reasons and therefore, I highly recommend going. First, its the only site with Mayan and a colonial Spanish structure. The conquistadors built a church from the",
          "A great site to visit, very close to Merida. A cenote on site where you can swim and relax after your tour.",
          "It's a smaller site but very original, interesting to visit together with the museum. There is a beautiful open cenote with clear water where you can bathe.",
          "Went through with a tour group. Guide was very knowledgeable, spoke great English, easy to understand and follow. Ruins area is well kept and easy to get around.",
          "Nice buy small ruins. A mix of old Mayan and some Spanish structures and a small xenote to swim. The nicest pyramid was closed since they are rebuilding part of the ceiling.",
          "We went last March 2017 over Spring Break. The ruins were pretty neat. The cenote was cool. The boys loved dipping their feet in it. I love old architecture so I thought it was neat. The boys loved \"racing\" to the top of one of the ruins. Our tour guide was really good and",
          "The best part is the natural cenote you're allowed to swim in. This is what most people come here for. The ruins are not very interesting including the Temple of the Dolls. A good restaurant option on your way to Dzibilchat\u00fan is Hermana Rep\u00fablica in Xcanat\u00fan, a 12 min drive away",
          "I know, awesome title. Dzibilchaltun is worth seeing once if you have the time to spare and you are already in Progreso",
          "Excellent for a quick tour of ruins and a dip in a cenote. You can see the ruins while swimming in the cenote!",
          "If you've been to Uxmal, Kabah, Ek Balaam or Chichen Itza, these ruins are definitely not up to par. However, the highlight was the museum which, although small, was very well done. Do the museum before you go and visit the ruins - it'll give you a great perspective on the",
          "Went to these Ruins in February and was in awe of the history and Construction of the Event Square. Don't miss this Mayan Treasure",
          "This is an interesting Mayan site. It has ruins, a museum and a nice cenote so bring your bathing suit. If you sit on the edge and dangle your feet little fish will nibble on your toes. Kinda fun experience.There is a snack bar upstairs near the entrance. It has a limited menu",
          "I went to the ruins coming from a Carnival Cruise. Our tour guide gave such great information regarding the Maya Civilation, the land and the language...he spoke in Maya. You cannot bring regular sized back packs into the site, you\u2019ll have to check them in.",
          "Dzibilchalt\u00fan is the site of a Mayan town (20,000 in its heyday) and a later Catholic settlement. Conveniently located only about 40 minutes drive from the center of M\u00e9rida, it is a manageable size and has everything one needs to start exploring the Mayan world which once",
          "I have visited over 40 Mayan sites across Mexico and Guatemala. This was my worst experience. They have ceased being an historical site and have become a machine for taking money from tourists. Everything was an up charge and for the price I could have had a meal for two at",
          "I went mid morning by myself. The ruins themselves are small compared to Mayapan or Chichen itza and not as crowded. The draw card for these ruins is the cenote. It\u2019s beautiful, however again not too big compared to most. I caught an Uber their and back and had no issues. They",
          "We had a hire car but it is about 30 mins from city centre. It\u2019s well sign posted and very cheap to enter at about 100 pesos per couple. The cenote is amazing and easy to swim in. The ruins are easy to navigate and well preserved. Well worth a visit, probably allow an hour",
          "The ruins of Dzibilchaltun are not quite as impressive as Chichen itza but they are more intimate. There is a plaza with several large buildings around it and about a half a mile away is the famous temple of the seven dolls. It can get hot so bring a hat, sunscreen and mosquito",
          "These ruins are about 7 miles north of Merida and so small that most buses do not go here. This is an advantage!! There are no giant crowds. The site was a huge Mayan city but has been unexcavated - probably due to (no) funding. It is a fairly long walk from the entrance to the",
          "Reviews suggest the site to be over-priced and not as significant as others... We can\u2019t comment whether or not the site is \u201csignificant\u201d but would say that at 154 pesos per person, limited visitors, interesting museum, lack of vendors, cenote and a nice (cheap!) restaurant, the",
          "We used Shore excursioner.com for our tour guide. We had Ivan and he was excellent! very engaging, very funny, we learned a great deal. We did a combo tour of the ruins and the city of Merida.",
          "This is an easy visit from Merida. Take a city bus or colectivo (8 pesos per person) to the end of the line at Chablekal. Here you can take a mototaxi (15 pesos per person) to the ruins a mile or so away. The mototaxi is a fun ride. The ruins are good but what makes this site",
          "The ruins cover a large area. None are extremely high. The cenote is a great place to relax and dangle your feet in the water. The fish nibble at your feet, giving you a ticklish pedicure. A few even swam in the cenote. Restaurant was mediocre.",
          "I toured the site last week, fortunately during a spell of cooler local weather as there is quite a bit of walking involved in seeing all of the buildings. Although relatively small as Mayan sites go, it was interesting nonetheless and gave a deeper insight into the Mayan",
          "Enjoyable excursion booked during cruise. The ride to and from site was comfortable and on time. The guide Mary was informative and attentive to the needs of the group. It was great to explore the ruins, some of which you could climb up. There were some that were bing",
          "We don't typically book our excursions though our cruise ship because you can save money with the locals. We were able to visit the ruins with a tour we booked through AutoProgreso at the bus station we found walking around the town. It cost us each approximately $30 each and",
          "We visited the ruins with a tour we booked through autoprogreso at the bus station where the pier shuttle drops you off in Progreso. It cost $32 each, and the entire tour took about 3.5 hours with it dropping us off at the end of the pier by the cruise ship. In hindsight, I",
          "I love this site...love wandering the ruins and walking the white road between them, no to mention swimming in the small cenote which is much easier to get into than many others. The museum there is also good and thoughtfully curated - well worth spending time there.",
          "This city was the second most important for the Maya on the Yucatan peninsula. The vernal equinox expereinced here shows the amazing knowledge of the Maya. The museum has many artifacts and good explanations from both the pre-colombian and Spanish periods.",
          "After some difficulty trying to get a bus here, we managed to Uber to the sight for less than 100 pesos. Great site, on the smaller side with a wonderful large open cenote to cool off in. Entrance is free if you are a teacher in Mexico. Entrance is free to Mexicans on Sunday,",
          "This site is not overly impressive if you have seen Chichen Itza. It is small with few buildings, a nice open cenote, and a good museum of Mayan and Colonial artifacts. The trip from Merida by collectivo went well, but be aware that it is not easy to get transport from the site",
          "A visit to Dzibilchaltun was a welcome surprise. We visited on our way to Progresso. We hired a guide near the entrance who was enthusiastic with excellent English",
          "These ruins and associated Cenote were just a slight 15 minute detour on our way from Merida to the coast. They were interesting to see, especially the House of the Seven Dolls and small pyramid. We didn\u2019t swim in the Cenote. It it looked like fun so wear your swim gear when",
          "We loved these ruins as they were a little out of town and a bit of an adventure to get to (approx 1km hike from where the collective dropped us off), not too many people and climbing for \u201clittle people\u201d!",
          "Great site with a cenote you can swim in. Be careful where you park as the parking is not coordinated well. I got parked in while there.",
          "This cultural park is close to Merida and very well kept. Enjoyed seeing the Mayan ruins here and walking through the grounds. The cenote is the most beautiful I have ever seen and the waters are clear and warm for a swim so bring your suit.",
          "Don\u2019t miss this spot... fabulous ruins with a gorgeous refreshing cenote. We spent an hour wandering around the ruins and then headed over to the cenote. It\u2019s only a 30 min drive from Merida.",
          "Our guide (Elias) with autoProgreso tours was excellent. He was very knowledgeable, and we thoroughly enjoyed the trip.",
          "We visited Dzibulchaltun Mayan Ruins and Xlacah Cenote in Dec. Booked as a cruise excursion. We absolutely loved the ruins. The history and architecture is stunning. The tour guide was informative but rushed. We also stopped for a dip in Xlacah Cenote, which is absolutely",
          "My wife and I visited this site with a tour group. The Maya and Spanish structures here are beautiful and the signage instructive. The cenote is exquisite - - crystal clear water and splendid water lilies. We did not swim in the cenote, but it looked refreshing. We learned a",
          "I visited the Dzibilchaltun Mayan Ruins site with my son and his wife. We visited the museum first half of museum was closed for renovation. The site was not very huge, but 2 hours is a good amount of time to explore everything. We went to see the pyramid, the palace, and the",

          "Great little ruin site with an amazing cenote, bring your suit! A small site, perfect for those who don't want too much walking.",
          "Loved the ruins. Not to big and easy to walk. The cenote is nice and cool. The water is very clear and the fish nibble on your feet for a free pedicure.",
          "The museum was amazing. The Cenote was great. People were swimming there and next time I will bring a bathing suit. The history and stone monuments are really worth the time to explore. I will go back there again. It\u2019s not far from Merida.",
          "We took a tour with Carnival cruise excursion. Our tour guide was Kumen aka Spicey. He was a fun guide who was very knowledgeable. The food at the restaurant upstairs was fresh and tasty but a little pricey. Overall I would do it again.",
          "In my opinion it was so beautiful Make sure you find a guide in Merida before you go because at the entrance of the place they don't have any information brochure or voucher to help you If you go for the equinox on September the experience is going to be amazing, hire a guide",
          "One gets the impression that - once upon a time - the ruins were better cared for than they are currently. From what our (Uber) guide told us, they have expanded the site through further excavation over the years. This expansion has not been accompanied by greater care for this",
          "This archeological site is easy to get to from the city. It is fun to swim in the cenote; interesting to see a church in the centre of the main square; and to see an observatory and secabe (sacred road) so close proximity to the city. So, ideal if you do not have much time.",
          "It was a very hot day, but we still climbed up the pyramids, dipped in the cenote, truly enjoyed the ruins.",
          "The most important archeological sites in the Yucatan are Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Uxmal and Dzibilchalt\u00fan. In Dzibichalt\u00fan the most stunning temple is the so called Temple of the dolls, where 7 little clay dolls were found. You can see those in the site museum. But its most important",
          "We visited Dzibilchaltun site primarily to enjoy a refreshing swim in the cenote. Big mistake. We arrived by Uber from M\u00e9rida (140 pesos)and paid 142 pesos each for the entrance. The site itself is rather small - there are a few ruins (that you can also climb) and a cenote.",
          "This Mayan ruins are quite nice and easy to reach from Merida. There are 2 parts in the ruins separated by a long place and at the bottom of one, a beautiful Cenote where you can observe crystalline water and fishes, you can get into the water with caution, avoiding any chemical",
          "Take a private tour, it is worth it! Amazing ruins and a beautiful cenote where you can swim at the end of the tour. My kids loved it and us too!",
          "We visited here a few years ago. The walk around the site of the ruins are breathtaking and easily accessible. It is amazing to walk inside of the structures. The history is great. This is an excellent place for photographic opportunities. When you are done seeing the ruins,",
          "We can't recommend this site enough! It has everything including a beautiful pyramid complex with an informative museum, and refreshing cenote. We especially appreciated the fact that this site is not crowded like many of the other Mayan sites in Mexico. We were able to enjoy",
          "This place is absolutely spectacular. I recommend everyone should visit and also swim in the spring pool. Gorgeous! My only complaint is that foreigners are charged so much more than the locals. I feel taken advantage of.",
          "I live between merida and Progreso. The ruins are local and I visit them often, for the spring solstice is my favorite time. The museum is very informative and the little Mayan village is very nice. The cenote has these little fishes who nibbles on dead skin and it is a very",
          "Dzibilchaltun Ruins is a great place to see the past of Yucatean history. I went in July, which was very hot with humidity. It was fairly quite considering it is still summer, but most go to Chichen Itza instead. Great place to take the family! There is also like a lagoon type",
          "What a great day toodling around the grounds and enjoying the ruins. Unlike Chichen Itza, you can still climb these if you so wish. It had just rained so the unusually clear cenote had little visibility but that did not stop us from jumping in. If is so close to Merida and",
          "Book this excursion with carnival cruise. The price is reasonable. Jorge and Alejandro the best tour guides in Merida. From the cruise port, drive is about 25-30min in a very comfortable bus with cold air conditioning, the seats are very spacious. They provide a bottle of cold",
          "Excellent place for a fast visit very close to Merida. One of the best open cenotes to swim. The archeological part is easy to access and the museum offers a nice information package of the mayan heritage and the zone. We spent a nice day in the family and the kids really love",
          "Leaving Merida at 9am, we arrived at the site before the car park opened, thus saving the car parking fee. We hired a guide who we paid 450 mxn for our group of 3 people. This lady was VERY knowledgeable, she brought with her a folder full of illustrations and photos relating",
          "The trip to this ruins was very educational. Very poor area, and yet our guides were wonderful on Valco tours. We connected through Carnival cruise ship excursions. The ruins were fun because you were free to walk around on your own, but also left you with many questions once",
          "It's super sad to see places likes this go to waste because of the people that manage it or work there, the government should be more careful with this. The personnel is rude, they are close minded and seem to hate tourists, which is surprising because it's usually the other way",
          "This is a fairly quiet set of ruins close to Merida. You can climb most structures. While they aren't as impressive as some of the others, you can also swim in the cenote that is onsite. The water is very clear; there is a shallow end and a deep end. The fish liked to bite",
          "This is such a beautiful and well maintained treasure of Mayan history. It is small and easy to manage, as we had a 3 and 4.5 year old walking with us. It is about 20-30 min drive from Merida Centro. We took the 45 minute guided tour with one of the guides at the entrance",
          "Ruins and swimming in Cenote. There was a lot of construction and renovation going on for a proposed museum. Nice place, close to Merida.",
          "Wonderful place where everything is accessible. Nice little museum, cenote, ruins and a sense of peace on this site. I could feel the area and have a sense of how it used to be. Not as commercialized as Chichen Itza. Even the restaurant was nice. Makes for a very pleasant",
          "Quite big area with many ruins which you can climb on! To reach the most remote part of this complex, where the sun rays passes through the window during equinox, you will have to walk about 10 minutes straight. We've spent more than two hours there and it wasn't wasted time.",
          "I booked the tour of the Dzibilchaltun Ruins with Turitransmerida. The tour guide was excellent and he would always call be my name. That shows this tour company is very professional because usually tour guides dont call you by your first name. My favorite place here was the",

          "This is a place not to well know for the turism that comes from Cancun or the cruise ships It is very beautiful and there is a cenote that used to supply water for this mayan city, the cenote is spectacular with crystal clear water and lily pond floating at the center They have",
          "We went on a tour to ruins. It was a short bus ride from Progreso. It is a small site but very interesting and convenient. There is a small temple, pyramid, and walls and steps. You are allowed to climb on them. There is also a museum with exhibits from this site that was most",
          "Dzibilchaltun is so close to Merida and such an amazing site. In the summer months it is very hot, May 19th it was 102 f when we visited. From one end to the Temple of the Seven Dolls it is a good mile walk. Make sure you stop and get water at the gift shop. There is a Cenote in",
          "This was an extensive Mayan ruins site, with pyramids in various states of collapse, myriad buildings and plenty of ancient things to climb on, a cool, clear cenote with swimming allowed. Be warned, go here in cooler months. There is sparse shade and the sun is relentless. Two",
          "A friend recommended that we should go to this archaeological zone, and we took some friends from Australia. We all loved the place, and were quite surprised at the size and amount of buildings found on site. Unfortunately the museum was closed, like every Monday. Good excuse to",
          "While there are numerous sites in the Yucatan and most within a few hours from Merida, Dzibilchaltun is a must visit. This is an unrestored site and very original and one of the oldest. Try to go on the equinox and go early to see the sun rise and if it's not raining you can",
          "This was a nice visit. It was an excursion planned through Carnival. Our tour guides, \"Spicy\" and \"Queeny\" were very sweet and so extremely knowledgeable. You could tell the passion they had for teaching you about this place. We are from Texas and the heat does not normally",

          "I guess I am biased as I have seen some impressive ruins in Honduras and Guatemala, but I found the Dzibilchaltun to be underwhelming to see, and poorly organized. We went in, did not receive any guidance or map so we guessed at where to go. Made the mistake of going in the mid",
          "It may be hard to pronounce, but this small site is, we were told, one of the most important Mayan sites with one of the longest histories of occupation. There is a first-class museum at the entrance to the site with some wonderful stone pieces, pottery, and grafitti too; also a",

          "Beautiful ruins. You will spend there like 3 hours +. The cenote is beautiful, clear water. Nice place to take pictures. If you go to Merida you have to go to these ruins. Nice museum too.",

          "I've been to these ruins before but without a guide. It is worth the $35 American! Our guide was incredible and his English was perfect. If you can get a small group, it's best. The guides have so much information. The cenote here is the best. Let the little fish give you a",
          "Went over with my husband and my 10mo old baby during the easter holidays. Not as big as Chichen but definetely worth paying a visit. The Cenote was closed the day we went but the view was just impressive.",
          "These ruins and cenote are not very big but they do have a certain charm and it's a pleasant way to spend a morning and there is lots of history in the little town. We enjoyed ourselves and the museum is nice.",

          "THIS is my 3rd Mayan ruins in 3 weeks and I loved it. It was a beautiful walk into the Ruins and we enjoyed walking about. The Cenote was not open when we went.",
          "We chose this place because of my mother who uses a walker, because the walk is not very far. The path isn't paved so we had to go patiently in the hot sun. Maybe they should make walkers with off-road tires? Make sure how many meters it is before trying it. Coming back felt so",
          "In a few ways I like it better than Chitchen-itza, There are very few people there, I didn't see any vendors to sell you stuff. You can climb on the ruins, but not go in the temple or church, they are roped off. There are two Cenotes there, one you can swim in, it is shallow on",
          "We have visited many ruins and enjoyed them decided to see this and happy we went. Take a bathing suit and enjoy the Cenote",
          "This ruin is not one of the highly publicized ruins in the Yucatan pennisula but it is one of my favorites! It is easily accessible from Merida by bus, is not very busy, has a lovely museum attached to wonderfully photogenic ruins and even has an above ground spring-- cenote",
          "I've been to a few runs around the Yucatan and I was surprised that this wasn't too busy being so close to Merida. We went at kind of the end of the day and were tired and hot. We beelined it for the very nice cenote and took a nice dip to cool down. By the time we were done",
          "Booked through Carnival we visited the ruind and toured Merida city and had lunch. Very educational but were comfortable shoes.alot of walking.",
          "This is the archaeological site closest to Merida, just off the highway to Progreso. The site entrance is not well sign-posted; Google Maps is very useful for finding it. The ruins are interesting but there are few signs offering information; guides are available for hire. There",
          "Located between Merida and Progreso, a great place to stop while you're on your way to one or the other. The ruins are much smaller than Chichen Itza or Uxmal, but still impressive in its own right. It also features a colonial era church made from the stones of Mayan buildings,",
          "Dzibilchaltun is located close to Merida. It is great for a quick family and friends stop. We visited with two other families. One had little kids and the other had teens and twenties. A nice relaxing day. About three hours.",
          "Nice to visit after noon and stay there for the cenote, the people at the front was rude they don't deserve to work in a turist place",
          "The oldest Maya ruins in Mexico, teamed up with a museum and a cenote. Each worth the visit itself. Worthwhile to hire a guide at the door. A hat is a must.",
          "We enjoyed our outing. We had access to a car so it was a 30 min drive. Although a smaller Mayan site we found it very interesting. It only takes about 1/2 an hour to stroll the main sites if you are in a hurry. There are other structures to visit off the main path. There were",
          "Dzibilchaltun (the place where there is writing upon the stones) is located just north of Merida - and is quite large. There is a two-part museum (one on the archaeology, and one on the history of region) that is very interesting, and should not be missed. The most famous",
          "Its a nice place that offers guided tours so you can learn about the mayan culture, the place is well conserved and at the end of the tour you could go into the cenote for swimming",
          "Great small ruin site close to Merida & Progeso. The cenote on site is a refreshing way to end the tour. We hired a guide for 350 pesos",
          "The Mayan ruins here Merida Mexico are great. There is even a natural spring where you can swim. Very refreshing, cool, clean, clear , and beautiful water. if you go to mexico on a cruise ship and when you get off the boat i recommend that you do the excursion for the Ruins",
          "If you want to experience a true glimpse into both current and ancient Mayan culture, this is the place to go. Jose and Victor gave informative presentations on the everyday lives of Mayan people today. They shared information about Mayan contributions to history as well as the",
          "We booked this tour through the cruise line on a recent cruise. The local tour operator, Total Gusto, met us at the pier in Progreso. Unfortunately, Progreso is not very scenic. On the approximately 30-minute bus ride to the ruins site our tour guide, Luis, made the best of it",
          "Everything we read, it stated the admission was 65 Pesos, so this is what we planned on. We took a public bus to Chablekel for 8 Pesos each. From there, you can get a motorcycle Tuk-Tuk to take you to the ruins. They charge 50 Pesos a person. When we reached the ticket",
          "We chose this excursion off of our cruise ship because my sister had never seen Mayan ruins before. She thought it was interesting but I had previously visited another site and compared to that it was just OK. The ruins site is small and easily navigated. We had a tour guide",
          "The entrance fee is $7.50USD and then they recommend a tour guide for $22.50USD. We chose the guide and he was knowledgeable but then you feel obliged to tip him so now we have an expensive venture for what you see. The ruin where they found 7 dolls from Mayan heritage (500BC)",
          "First be aware that this site closes at 4pm. It's easy to visit Dzibilchaltun ruins and cenote from Merida. You can taxi or Uber there. It is halfway between Merida and Progreso. The museum exceeded my expectations. Many of the exhibit signs include English. The museum covers",
          "Dzibilchaltun! One of the most important ceremonial centers of the Mayan world with over 2000 structures and a Cenote X'lacah, a deep natural water pool. We booked this tour as an excursion from our cruise that ported at Progreso. The bus trip was a short 30 minute ride. The",
          "As for ruins, nothing special really but you will get an amazing swim in that open cenote especially if you go early morning so you beat the crowd.",
          "First, if you end up in Progreso on a Cruise, don't pay the cruise tour price. If you take the cruise shuttle from the pier into town, you can get taxi's that will take 4 of you there and back for $60 ($15 each). The admission price is $10, so your total expense is $25 per",
          "The ruins here are lovely and all climbable. There is also a cenote, that was very busy. There are lots of tourists here so the cenote gets crowded. But be warned. You are not allowed to take bags into the area, so if you are there with children, you must each carry your towel",
          "Short drive from Merida maybe 15 minutes. Go early and gets crowded on holidays and weekends. Nice cenote to swim.",
          "the site is on the way to progresso on the beach from merida. it is easily reached. however, there really is not much to see.",
          "Like the title says, it is just a short drive north of Merida on the road to Progresso.Like the other sites, it opens at 0800 and closes at 1700. A wise person will be there when they open as the temperatures rise quickly and it is getting hot after 1100. We visited in December",
          "Kinda fun stop on way to Progresso from Merida. The ruins are like nothing compared to Chichen Itza or Uxmal, but you can climb on the structures and swim in a pond coming from a cenote (cave with underground river). Bring a bathing suit, because the Yucatan is always",
          "Enjoyed greatly the visit, guide very recomendable to dress the site, very interesting explanation on how they mastered stars and weather. Recommendation: - Arrive before 10 am in peak season, to move dynamically through site and also could enjoy a nice dip at cenote on site,",
          "This was great! The tour guide was great and the price was even better. There is a sonate (water hole) that was beautiful and you could swim. It was cold but clear and wonderful.",
          "These small ruins are so very close to downtown Merida making them a very convenient attraction. The area is small making the walk about quite easy and enjoyable. We didn't have time to visit the museum nor did we bring swim suits for a dip in the extremely beautiful above",
          "This ruin was not as interesting as Mayapan and the ruinns on the Ruta Puuc. It is still worth seeing, especially for the museum. It has a timeline of the Mayan ruins showing pre-classc, classic, and post-classic artifacts. It helps you understand what you've seen at other",
          "This is another wonderful place to learn about Mayan history and the Spanish influence specifically. Quick notes: 1)There is an indoor museum portion then a walk around portion and a giant open cenote that you can swim in. There's a shallow end and a deeper end. Lots of fish.",
          "Well-conserved archeological site. As many of the ancient Mayan cities, shows signs of a great civilization. 2 of the best things: being so close to M\u00e9rida city, and its sunk hole (cenote).",
          "The ruins were impressive. We read a bit about them before hand so that helped tremendously. In retrospect, we should have hired a guide probably to know more. The cenote is like a pond with water lili's and fish but with some very deep parts at one end. We enjoyed the",
          "The ruins themselves are not the biggest and best in the area but are worth seeing in the setting, plus the grounds are huge and you can wander around and explore the different buildings on your own. The cenote is a bonus and great after walking around on a hot day. Negatives",
          "My family and I went here for the day and it was fantastic. We have a tween and a 7 year old..they were able to climb up some of the ruins which was a huge plus for us. Our kids are very active! We were also able to cool off after the ruins in the beautiful cenote. We loved the",
          "We hired a personal driver to take us around the city of Merida and one of the places we visited was Dzibilchaltun Ruins. We paid $10 US for entrance into the ruins and was able to roam and at the end swim in the Cenotes. It was beautiful and the water as clear and cool on the",
          "The ruins themselves are small, nothing much to see. Upon arrival we were offered a guided tour for $25 for a group of 11 people. It was very informative and lasted about 40 min. After that we were free to take pictures or take a swim in the cenote. We enjoyed the cenote so",
          "Short drive from Merida. Very easy to visit and explore on you own or with a guide. Bring a swim suite and take a plunge into the cenote--very easy cenote for swimming. Crystal clear water. Easy access. Ruins are interesting and the cite is compact enough to explore in about",
          "We did not book the tour via the cruise. Do not do this. Much cheaper to go through local tour operator one you get off the ship, I managed to negotiate 5 for the price of 4 and got a great deal. We had time to roam around Progresso prior to the tour leaving from the bus",
          "What a great place to stop by and enjoy a morning with friends and family exploring the area. After going up and down the pyramids you can jump in the local Cenote for a refreshing experience.",

          "This tour was very interesting. I learned alot about the Mayan history. The ruins were unbelievable! You were able to climb to the top of all the ruins there. This site offer many places to take awesome photos. There is also a gorgeous cenote on location. The little fish in the",

          "Pay attention not to go on Mondays. They are not going to tell you before purchasing tickets that Museum is closed on Mondays. Regardless you pay same price. Pyramids are very small. Cenote is the best but gets crowded. It's a very small and not too deep on one side. The other",

          "This is the first ruin I visited and I was blown away by it. It isn't uxmal in size and importance, but it is very special. It has an astrological temple at the end of a road connected to the main ruins which is really cool. And it has an amazing large open air cenote where you",
          "It was a very hot day. Our tour guide was wonderful, informative on everything. The ruins was not to tall, just right! We were careful to climb to the top.The cenote was different to see and we had only a short time to stay there. Tour over and we were ready to go back to the",
          "We were originally very excited to visit the cenote and the ruins here, but when we got here all we dealt with were bad vibes right when we entered. Upon purchasing our tickets, we were greeted by a very rude woman who made a huge deal about our go pro (that we had to pay for to",
          "Known as one of the oldest Mayan site, Dzibilchaltun is an enchanting site. The Temple of the Seven Dolls and the path leading up to it is pretty amazing, with an energy that is still very strong. I was there at its peak heat, but still got a lot out of visiting this site. There",

          "We live just down the road from Dzibilchalt\u00fan -- a few centuries ago, our neighborhood was probably part of it! -- so we've visited a few times and really love it. It's broken into two different sections connected by a long, straight road. Both sides are fascinating, as are the",
          "The ruins were a short 20-30 minute ride on an air conditioned bus. The guide spoke along the way and was very educated and passionate about the mayan people and the community. The ruins were very interesting and there was a beautiful cenotes to take a refreshing dip and get",

Don\u00b4t forget to bring bathing clothes to take a chance to swim in that amazingly clean water! Be prepared to walk alot and wear comfortable shoes especially if you want",
          "This was our second visit in less than 2 years! Nice entry walk explaining various Mayan statues. Excellent museum. Mayan ruins that are accessible to the public. A large open cenote for a wonderful swim with the bonus of free fish pedicure!",
          "Took an excursion through Carnival while on a cruise. Not sure why they stop in Progreso. Skip Merida. It's a dirty and a mess. The ruins were interesting and close to the port. However, I would not go back to Progreso. The tour guide did a good job, but the Merida portion",
          "Don\u00b4t understand why it\u00b4s so expensive there, it cost almost like Uxmal wich is much better and much more interesting. We went here because we read on tripadvisor about an amazing cenote, what a surprise to have found a open hole with very green water we saw other people not",
          "The tour of the ruins was fascinating. We went with the tour guide who told us the stories of the civilization that lived on the site. Without the tour guide, we would've missed learning about the culture and ways of the Mayan. The museum was quite informative with excellent",
          "Dzibilchaltun is a worthwhile Mayan ruin. It probably provides the best example of how the Spanish dismantled the Mayas' religion when they arrived, with the massive Franciscan arch plonked in the middle of the ritual plaza. The grounds are compact but include the second largest",
          "We took a taxi which cost us 600 pesos ( round trip) from down town Merida. The driver waited for us until we were done. Entrance fee was 160 pesos per person and we hired a guide for 200 pesos. He was very knowledgeable and very informative. We visited the museum for about 10",
          "We visited the site in August. Actually, our visit was quite quick. There is not much to see. The ruins are not very maintained, which makes the archeological site less interesting than others ones around Merida like Uxmal or Chichen Itza.",
          "My wife and I with family and friends have been here many times. In addition, we have a friend that has done it in conjunction with Chitzen Itza for the Equinox (the sun is centered through the temple here at that time). It's really spectacular and there is a great museum on",
          "Very close to Merida, lovely small museum, the cenote is easily swimmable as it is not in a cave. Although small children can get fidgety (as they will in archaeological sites), it is very much worth the visit. Lovely hacienda for breakfast or lunch 3 kms. before, but they have",
          "We came here on a very hot day on our way to Progreso. Didn't visit the ruins too extensively, but really enjoyed the great cenote. Lots of people eventually, so we left but really enjoyed our time there.",
          "Such an amazing structure for the sun to shine in all four direction at the same time...Truly a must see....",
          "This is a good archeological site to go to if you are pressed for time or not terribly interested in Mayan ruins. Just 15 min from Merida it is an easy trip to make in the morning & be back in Meriday for lunch. Major bonus to visiting here is an ground level cenote that is",
          "Great water way that is nor under a cave, best months to go are October thru December when the water its really clear and you can see fishes swimming around you",
          "Great place to visit, varied activities, like seeing a museum, visiting the pink flamingo lagoon, seeing the ruins, swimming in the cenote.",
          "The small site and accompanying museum are well worth the visit. Site was not crowded. The ruins while not as spectacular as Uxmal or Chichen It's provide yet another glimpse into the life of the Maya. Convenient short ride from Merida.",
          "This was my favorite Mayan site during my trip to Merida. The buildings are beautiful and the museum is very well done. Bring a bathing suit and towel in case you want to swim in the cenote. Make sure you bring cash, the gift shop is cash only and the ticket office's credit card",
          "Definitely worth a stop if you are staying in Merida or nearby. About 20 minutes from the city on the highway to Progreso. I think about 25 pesos for parking and 65 pesos for admission. There are two sides to the site after you enter - the main ruins to the right, and another",
          "If you are visiting Progreso, Mexico and don't want to spent an entire day at the ruins, Dzib is a good choice. They are only a 25 minute ride from town and a nice representation of the way the Mayans lived. While not the largest ruins I've visited, they are in good shape. One",
          "I took my kids to the ruins yesterday morning (July 7, 2016), and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The ruins are amazing to see. There are tour guides that you can hire once inside the park for a small fee (350 pesos for our family of 3, for a 45 minute tour). I highly recommend the",
          "The Mayan ruins at Dzilbilchatun are pretty cool and visited frequently. They are located less than 20 minutes outside of Merida to the North. In order to get there, you can take a bus, pay for a taxi, or rent a car. My wife and I rented a car from Veloz Renta located a few",
          "This is a very good introduction to pyramids in the M\u00e9rida area. It is small enough to walk around and enjoy - you can also walk up onto the pyramid. There is a cenote to swim in on the land too.",
          "When visitors come to the region, they often don't have time to visit this site. It's understandable for people who want to see the famous places such as Chichen Itza and Uxmal, but if you have extra time or if you're looking for alternatives, this is a place worth checking out.",
          "We have family in Merida, so when we ported in Progreso, we called them up. They took us to these ruins and they are amazing, all the history is breathtaking, the cenote is also very pretty and the guide told us it used to be a sacrificial cenote with human bones stil in its",
          "Great ruins close to Merida. Very accessible even for those with some limited mobility. I have bad knees but got around here quite well. The museum is fantastic (though if you don't speak/read Spanish, you might want a tour--can't recall if they offer self-guided tours) and",

          "We visited here on a really hot day and when we reached the area around the cenote it was cool and shaded and we did not want to leave. The ruins are quite extensive and you can actually climb some of them. If you have time you will want to go prepared with towels and a bathing",

          "It's a beautiful place near to Merido or Progreso cities, 10 to 20 minutes in car, with simple but interesting archeological ruins but the amazing thing here is the opened air cenote. If you arrive early you will find it crystalline and quite water.",
          "These ruins were a wonderful addition to our trip. Many in our group could not handle the vast amount of walking visiting a place like Chichen Itza would require so a friend recommended Dzibilchaltun. There is plenty to see, but no so much that you are exhausted by the end of",
          "My husband and I chose to visit these ruins as a cruise excursion because of their proximity to the port (we didn't want to spend hours on a bus) and because you can still touch, climb, explore these ruins with the exception of the temple. There is also a cenote at these ruins",
          "If you have not too much time, make sure you at least visit these ruins so close to Merida. Very well kept, so silent (go in the morning in case there are cruise buses coming in afternoon), beautiful cenote where we swam happily after a guided visit of the site. Very",

          "Dzibilchaltun was my favorite of the Mayan ruins in Yucatan! It's worth a visit if you like to escape the crowds and have a ruin to yourself to climb on. The ruin is easily accessible as a half-day trip from Merida. The Xcalah cenote at Dzibilchaltun is by far the best I saw in",
          "I gave this smaller sized ruin an extra star just based on the hundreds of kissing and tickling tiny fish at Xlakah cenote. The cenote has a very shallow end and a very deep end. I am glad I spent an hour swimming here and I imagine that children would love it. The admission is",
          "Enjoyed my half day here. Not too crowded, enough to see walking around for a few hours. Took the combi bus from Merida to Chablekal for 7 pesos, then a moto taxi from Chablekal to the ruins for 10 pesos. Easy and cheap, nice day",

          "I will start by saying that there is no large pyramid as in Chichen Itza or Uxmal. I hive a full star extra due to the Xlakah cenote and the hundreds of kissing fish. I strongly recommend you leave time to either swim or put your feet in to experience dozens of cute fish kissing",
          "Totally amazing. Bring your swim suit....a pity that we arrive late to view the museum but the ruins are impressive and there's no crowd. The cenote is small but cosy",

          "Didn't expect to find such elaborate ruins so close to Merida. Able to take a taxi both ways and therefore make to nice visit in less than a half day. You can also stop at the new museum of Mayan culture on the way back to town.",
          "I think the passion of our tour guide for his culture made the experience more special.( Jorge if your reading this I give you five thumbs up) The ruins were easy to navigate and the cenote was absolutely beautiful. If you go don't forget your swimsuit.",
          "Lower key site that's close in to Merida, it combines a cenote, Mayan pyramid and related ruins and an excellent museum.",
          "Dzibilchaltun has kind of a muted beauty; it may not seem as spectacular as other sites, but it's impressive nonetheless. I recommend taking a guided tour so you can see how much there is, for example, to the Temple of the Seven Dolls. It doesn't look like much, but it's an",
          "I went with my mother, husband and two of my children on this tour and it was very cool. My youngest on the tour was 6 and the oldest was 64 and they were both comfortable the entire time. Ivan was our tour guide and he was great. Ruins were amazing and the 7 door house is",
          "This is,really close to merida, so it's quite convenient, but its a lot mg walk from the parking area on a rubble pathway. This is impossible for kids strollers or wheelchairs so don't even consider it and there is no pyramid so it's disappointing from that perspective. I much",
          "Fascinating ruins with an interesting astronomical observatory. The ruins were more spread out giving us a chance to walk along the property. Intriguing Spanish chapel as well.",
          "The location near Merida is very convenient. Can take a combi van from Calle 58, 57y59. We took a taxi for 160 pesos b/c of time constraints. My only suggestion is that you speak with taxi about return trip cuz this is remote. They do have an info desk. @ ruins who was going to",
          "I went on 02/05/15. Ivan was our tour guide and he was great! He was entertaining and knowledgeable of the history and current culture.",
          "This site is less visited than many, but very interesting as it dates from much further back than Uzmal and Chichen Itza. There is also a very tranquil cenote. You can include a visit to Progresso and a top to see the flamingos on this trip.",
          "Dzibilchalt\u00fan, in Maya, means \u201cOld Village. It is thought to have been occupied from 300 BC to the Spanish conquest. This is a medium-sized archaeological site. The most famous structure on site is \u201cThe Temple of the Seven Dolls\u201d. During the Spring/Fall equinoxes the sun shines",
          "We were told that this was a small ruin, but close to Progresso. They were wrong! After 3.5 hours we wish we had more time to explore and swim in the cenote. You can only bring water and a camera but, you can check dry clothes and extras at the main gate. Sunscreen and good",
          "This is the most amazing place, especially if you like historic destinations! We came here on an excursion during our last cruise and will definitely come back again as soon as the chance arises! You can climb up the Temple of the Seven Dolls as well as some of the other",
          "We took an excursion from our cruise to tour these ruins. Our tour guide was great. And the history is pretty neat as well. You can climb on the ruins, and there is a cenote that you can swim in. After we left these ruins, we went to the Corona Beach Party just off the",
          "The story behind the ruins was interesting but quite long. There were only a few ruins to look at as well as a cenote that you could swim in. After looking at the ruins, you still have a lot of time leftover. We ended up eating authentic Mexican at the onsite restaurant. The",
          "We really enjoyed this tour. If you like history you must see these ruins. The cenote in this place is beautiful with crystal clear water. Take a towel in case you decide to jump in. The distance from progress is very short but you will have to walk a little bit once you get",
          "We took a taxi from Progresso to the ruins with our children. We went on a Wednesday (no cruise ships in progresso) and were delighted to find that the site was not crowded at all. If you were going to set out and design the perfect ruins for children, you would come up with",
          "We got there late and didn't have time to explore, but what a great place to spend an afternoon. You can explore and climb on the ruins, or chill by the beautiful outdoor cenote.",
          "Definitely worth a trip. Nice (short) day trip. The museum is excellent. Although these are not the biggest and most important Mayan ruins they are still very interesting. Favorite part was the beautiful Cenote where little fish nibble on your feet. Great also for kids.",
          "can climb the ruins with the kids and cool off in the cenote afterward our best ruins experience in all of Yucatan",
          "The Mayan ruins at Dzibilchaltun are a sort trip from the port at Progresso. This is a much smaller site than other Mayan ruins but well worth the trip, with an informed guide. The Mayan's are quite proud of their heritage and there is much to be learned about the site, the",
          "This late pre-conquest site is relatively small and the architecture, except for the well restored Temple of the Seven Dolls, is not particularly impressive. However, the museum there is excellent, with many pieces from Dziibilchaltun and other Yucatec sites. In addition, there",
          "My family and I traveled to Progreso and visited the Dzibilchaltun ruins and was led by an awesome guide named Wilbert. Wilbert was proud of his heritage and his knowledge of the area and it made the tour a hit with my family and those with us. The ruins themselves were",
          "Because of its size, this Mayan ruin can be covered in a relatively short visit. Bring your bathing suit and join Mexicans in having a cooling dip in the cenote (or spring). The attached museum is a treasure - lots to see and good artifacts.",
          "Short bus trip to the ruins from the cruise ship terminal. Excellent guides via Princess cruise excursions. There is some walking to do but it's almost all flat. Not paved though so I would not advise for wheelchairs. If you decide to climb the steps to the top of the monument",
          "The Dzibilchaltun sit is smaller than Uzmal, the other site we visited, but we found the museum to be very good and just, plain unexpected in a smaller site. The museum is not to be missed.",
          "the site museum is, as others have noted, an excellent introduction to Mayan culture, and it has a few beautiful pieces. The site is wild and pretty. The remains are worth the visit but nothing exceptional by Mexico standards. If you have time, go.",
          "We had a guide who explained what all of the ruins were. He explained about the human sacrifices that were made here. He showed us how where the sun comes through the archway and what it all meant. He took us inside a tomb and showed us all of the symbols. Please have a",
          "Too bad they roped off the Temple of the Seven Dolls. Also too bad that the young crowds just go there to party at the cenote. We were the only ones at the terrace restaurant and it was very good.",
          "I was visiting Merida and wanted to go to one of the ruins that I had not seen and that was also relatively easy to get to without a tour, a taxi, or a car rental. I took the \"collectivo\" to Chablekal and then took a motorized cart (not sure what the proper name is in Mexico,",
          "A very appealing site to the Mayan Historical freak. The site boasts an outdoor cenote where you can swim and get refreshed as well as the largest Mayan sundial I have seen upright and aligned with a Temple which registers the seasonal variations based on the sun's position.",
          "Took the excursion choice to Dzibilchaltun. Our tour guides were Wilbert and Jose! Both authentic Mayan's that had a lot of pertinent information to share with the tourist! Was educational, fun and enlightening! The guides knew so much information you didnt dare move from",
          "We took the free bus to the bus station at the end of the pier at Progreso and paid cash for this excursion, half the fare that Carnival wanted. There will be hawkers at the bus station plying their wares. Just say no thanks and don't act interested. Progreso is a",
          "Small site compared to Chichen or Uxmal but very nice indeed. The ruins are interesting if not somewhat plain. Everything can be seen and explored. The Cenote was a great plus. It is beautiful and at the surface. You and swim in it and the water is clear and cool.",
          "My friend and I visited the ruins in late October and would highly recommend to those interested in this type of thing. She has always wanted to go but I never wanted to take time away from my beach time, but having a day off a cruise ship in Progreso seemed the perfect time to",
          "This is convenient to Progreso and Chelem or the north area from Merida. The road is very good to get there. There is plenty of parking. Beware of the mosquitos and be prepared for them. I was not and it negatively affected my visit. I was not able to take my time, we were",
          "While small and compact, Dzibilchaltun is a very special place with it's Temple of the Seven Dolls, cenote and museum. It's very peaceful and can be a great place just to go and relax. Recommended.",
          "Smaller and much cheaper than Uxmal or Chitzen Itza, this site is on the road to Progreso and has some decent ruins, a little bar/restaurant, and a great Cenote. Creepy workers watching the bathers were unfortunately out the day we were but this is well worth a visit.",
          "We were with a cruise line tour. We had a short tour and then were left to explore on our own. We felt a little rushed and wish we would have had more time to explore the museum. We can read Spanish pretty well, but perhaps all the signs should have English translation as",
          "A super place to visit. You get great ruins, a cenote you can swim in, plus a beautiful museum full of artifacts. We had the best day I highly recommend this as a must see place!",
          "This place has some good ruins to see but keep in mind it is somewhat spread out from end to end. If it's a warm day you need comfy shoes and water for sure. This place also has a nice sink hole with warm water and fishes swimming around.",
          "Just 17 kilometers north of Merida, about half way to the beaches at Progreso, are the ancient ruins of the Mayan city of Dzibilchaltun. It once had as many as 200,000 inhabitants and was still occupied when the Spanish arrived. Work has been done on the ruins in recent years",
          "This destination is a triple treat. One of the most striking Mayan pyramid, guided tour and historical museum, and a cenote.",
          "Dzibilchaltun is half way between Merida and Progresso. The area is not too large and is easily accessible. Don't miss going to the museum to learn more about the ruins and if it's a hot day, take a dip in the open cenote.",
          "Enjoyed our trip here as quite different from Mayapan but then these ruins are much older than Mayapan. The museum is very good and sets the scene before looking at tns. Interesting that the Spanish built an open church here later. Gift shop is also very nice and things are",
          "A very manageable site that is even more interesting with a private guide. Even better is a swim in the cenote on site.",
          "Dzibilchaltun, located between Merida and Progresso in the state of Yucatan gives visitors an opportunity to view and understand Mayan ruins, swim in an open cenote and visit a very informative and interesting museum of Mayan history. The site is compact and quite enjoyable if",
          "Publicity leaflets and web sites mentioning Dzibilchaltun tend not to do it justice. Although the ruins are more ruined than in better known sites the experience here gave us a better sense of life for the Mayan people a thousand years ago than we felt in some of those",
          "we loved this place, it was small enough to be managable, especially in the heat of august. we went very early in the morning, were the first ones there and had a wonderful women guide, i cant remember her name but she is not mexican, i think it might be gabby....she was mindful",
          "A few quick minutes (20) north of Merida you will find Mayan ruins that although not as grand as Uxmal, will provide you with a sense of what a civilization was that has preceded you. As you stand at the principal ruin looking east and west you can sense the magnitude, majesty,",
          "This was an excursion choice from our Carnival cruise and we are so glad we picked it - great bang for your buck. If you are interested in seeing one of the Mayan ruins and learning about the Mayan culture without spending an entire day this is a perfect choice! Our tour guides",
          "We visited the ruins on 9/3/14 as part of our cruise ship stop in Progresso. I'm VERY glad we picked these particular ruins to visit, as the park is HUGE.You can opt to hire a guide but we didn't have any more money left so we just explored on our own. This is a very secluded,",
          "We visited the ruins on a Monday cruise stop at the Progreso port. The taxi was $60 round trip for 3 hours--30 mins there, 2 hours touring, 30 mins back. Set your timer. We almost didn't get that rate when we were seeking a taxi, but I insisted. We exchanged our dollars for",

          "Great site with interesting structures, very superior museum, and best of all you can cool off with a swim in a cenote. Close to Merida- took combi and then a moto-taxi (thin motorcycle with a park bench welded to front) which was a lot of fun.",
          "I'm always amazed when I visit ancient Mayan cities. While Dzibilchaltun isn't as spectacular as some other sites, it's far less crowded with visitors and it's still an amazing reminder of the Mayan culture's ability to thrive in an area that's somewhat inhospitable. Streets"

          "I have always wanted to visit a Mayan pyramid and climb it. This was great and I learned a lot from our guide. Food is not so great. ",
          "Very beautiful but its really expensive nowadays...",
          "Impressive  reconstructed Mayan city, just north of Merida. Has a museum included in the entry fee. Not crowded and has a cenote that you're  allowed to swim in.  No restaurants nearby. Need to go to Merida or Progreso  Beach to eat.",

          "This was a fantastic excursion while sailing on Carnival's Valor. It was a short bus ride from the pier, historic, well kept grounds. The weather was beautiful during the week of Thanksgiving. While it was cold and dreary in Texas, it was \u2026",
          "A must see visit to any tourist in this zone, although smaller than Chichen Itza, it's a lot closer to Merida, has a museum of artefacts, a Mayan village, a cenote and of course the ruins. Bring a bathing suit",
          "I'm sorry but don't waste your time and money here, we went to have breakfast and the restaurant was close, so we were forced to buy cookies, chips and cokes, we decide to go first to the museum inside the area and practically looks like no \u2026",
          "Great historic place with many ruins. I recommend you take a tour like my family and I did because that way you know what you're looking at and the history behind it. Bring a bathing suit, as there is a very beautiful lake. Highly recommended",
          "A little known archaeology site.  This site is informative in how Mayan cities were laid out.  Interesting too is a cattle ranch and church once occupied the site.  Easy to get to by Uber from Merida.",

          "Although not as impressive as other Mayan ruins, this location has some pretty unique and special features that make a visit worth it. Those that want to see Mayan ruins but not stray too far from the cruise ship docks will find this \u2026",
          "A small, but significant Mayan ruin. Besides the ruins, there is a museum on site which  depicts the life and beliefs of the Mayan people. Near the ruins is a beautiful picturesque cenote.This stop is well worth the visit.",

          "Great outing and very close to merida",
          "Website says the site closes at 5, got there at 410, and were denied access. Go plenty early! Website needs to be updated!\n\nWent back 1 year later and had a great time. Mexican cash only. In addition to the ruins bring your swimming suit and jump in the cenote to cool down. The little fish that nibble on your toes are great.",
          "This was a great place to visit, we really enjoyed all the history it was amazing, there was a sink hole that was a swimming area, so neat.",
          "152 pesos entry for Gringos \n\nDzibilchalt\u00fan... Try saying that three times fast! \n\nDzibilchalt\u00fan... Dzibilchalt\u00fan..... Dzibilchalt\u00fan....... \ud83e\udd14\n\nThese are some fantastic ruins with a nice museum on site. This place is made even more special \u2026",

          "I enjoy places like this. You are able to climb these ruins, unlike other ruin sites. And the have a very refreshing cenote that you can swim in",
          "Interesting rebuilt site with Spanish construction as well. Also has a cenote though we didn't go in, many did. Museum is interesting with pieces from all over the Yucatan. Lunch at the restaurant was good, chicken cooked in banana leafs, but a bit high priced.",
          "Interesting place with a beautiful cenote. The museum is a great place to learn more about Mayan people",
          "Loved to see the temple of the dolls.",

          "Good place to spend a few hours if you are in the area. The $152.00 Mx per person entrance fee ($117.00 for nationals) includes access to the Cenote so it's a nice swim/visit ruins combination. We got there via Uber  ($143.00 Mx) from Paseo \u2026",
          "As far as ruins, there is not much to see; but it gets five stars because there is a clear water cenote (sinkhole with ground water). Even better, swimming is permitted! I wouldn't recommend driving over an hour just to visit this place, \u2026",

          "An active site and so close to Merida.",
          "Great History here. Being able to see the ruins upfront and not bhind a glass was refreshing. ",
          "Think of this site as an easy start to your day... a comfortable and interesting stroll while having a chat w a friend, and a swim or foot soak (where tiny fish will give you a pedicure) in the cenote there. The museum is equally \u2026",
          "A must see!",
          "Impressive Mayan ruins",
          "Definitely worth a visit! The site is an old Maya entertainment complex with acoustics that are reminiscent of open air theatres in ancient Greece.....very cool! Best of all, it has a wonderful cenote that is perfect for a little afternoon swim \ud83d\ude0a",

          "This is the place to visit in Mexico because you are allowed to climb on the structures. So beautiful but also very mysterious and educational for everyone. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to experience a great piece of history.",
          "A nice set of ruins just a 20 minute drive from Merida. A bit on the pricey side to enter at mxn$140, but kids are free so that helps for families. Interesting structures that you can climb and explore, in a lovely jungle setting. A big \u2026",

          "One of the nearest archeological Mayan place, museum and Cenote there, just 30 min from Merida.",
          "So the ruins were very cool and beautiful. I was not super impressed with the cenote as I have seen prettier ones. I did think that $10 was way too much for an entrance fee and their private tour prices are high as well. Next time I'm in the area I will go a little further to Uxmal.",
          "We booked this excursion thru Carnival Cruises. Jorge was our wonderful and knowledgeable tour guide. The archeologic site was an amazing experience. Several buildings and a temple. A lovely Cenotes or sinkhole filled with water and is swimable. You feel the Mayan history and culture here.",

          "The unique cenote, pyramid and museum",
          "This place was great. Plenty of walking so be ready for some good hiking. So much history in one place can be very overwhelming, however we loved and enjoyed every minute. Certainly recommend having a guide with you to explain and interpret \u2026",
          "The pictures don't do this place justice. There are lots of Mayan ruins that you can walk on and some have caverns that you can go inside of. In addition there is a really cool Mayan Temple also that you can visit and take pictures but it's \u2026",
          "Dzibilchaltun is much more than an archaeological site. Located just a short bus, taxi, or car ride from Merida, it's very accessible for anyone seeking a morning or afternoon trip. The ruins are fun to explore and mostly accessible. The \u2026",

          "It was amazing only 12 minutes from port we had time to take pictures and climb the ruins. Please please take a small Bookbag or drawstring bag and make sure each person has two bottles of water. ",

          "Cool place, it's better with a guide person to live the entire experience",
          "This place is incredible. Not crowded like other spots, less touristy, but a GREAT site. The denote is incredible also. Tour with Spicey and his friends, they are great!",
          "Great ruins that you can go up and an open air cenote. We loved the sites but got eaten alive by mosquitos. Anytime we'd walk through shade, we'd come out with at least 20 of them on us. Maybe try and go on a day that they've fumigated.",
          "Highly underrated attraction of Merida, it has it all. Mayan pyramids, cenotes and great location! The best part is that is completely free for Mexican nationals on Sundays. As a tip, just borrow a Mexican ID from a friend,(it doesn't have to look alike)",
          "Amazing ruins. To see. And. Not lots of crowds. The guides are very knowledgeable and the history is incredible",
          "Incredible cenote, open to the surface, with crystal clear water. Bring a swimsuit. You will want to cool off after visiting the ruins.",

          "Amazing, but I'd like to see more information about each structure posted.",

          "This cenote was amazing. Probably the best of all the ones I went to during my time in Mexico. There were so many friendly fish that would bite your skin if you stood still in the shallows; it was a blast. There is also a ledge that you could jump, dive or flip off of into the water.",
          "The high price doesn't correspond to what's there. The ruins are very small and the cenote is not very impressive.",
          "It was a great experience to walk the Mayan ruins. The dolls in the museum were really interesting!!",
          "Very nice place. Nice cenote",

          "A little expensive for non mexicans. Also hard to find the right combi.",
          "Rich history of the Maya people. Only about 15 minutes from Progresso. The guides are great and the scenery is amazing.",
          "This was a wonderful archeological destination. Not only was it beautiful but it was like stepping back in time. Getting to see and explore the ruins was exciting. It's like going on adventure for the whole family. The tour guides are very knowledgeable and the museum was fascinating. I could have spent even more time here.",
          "Really beautiful site.  The ruins are amazing to see in person.  Many you can still climb.  There is a fair amount of walking, but it is easy and worth it!",

          "Enchanted scenery! Worth visiting!\nNot as large as other archeological places around but with a charming of iti own.\nLots of interesting facts.\nThe cenote Is beautiful by itself (not all year round, sometimes is a little dark), and the best way to cool down after visiting the ruins.\nMagical, as many places in the peninsula.",

          "Great place to visit! If you go early in the morning, like around 9 am you are the only one here and you can swim in the cenote without anyone else. They have a cenote, ruins, and a museum. There is plenty to explore, and if you look around \u2026",
          "It is a great and wonderful Mayan ruins experience suitable for the whole family.  Only 20 minutes from the port of Progreso Mexico and you can spend up to 2 1/2 hours touring the ruins and taking pictures and walking through their museum. \u2026",
          "Big dissapointment, not much to see of ruins, the cenote is very small,  half is dirty, half is clean, and the clean part is already packed with people even early morning. Also you are not allowed back packs or even small rucksacks in the \u2026",
          "Ok",
          "The Mayan pyramids are a beautiful site to behold. Pictures do not do the scale justice and building structures this massive would be quite a task with modern equipment...",

        "wiki": "Merida was a steam cargo ship built in 1906 by William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia for New York & Cuba Mail Steamship Co., owned and operated by Ward Line,  with intention of serving their New York to Havana route.\n\n\n== Design and Construction ==\nFollowing the sale of two of their older vessels, SS Havana and SS Mexico, to the US Government in 1905, Ward Line placed an order for four steamers to be built to operate on their expanding Cuban and Mexican trade routes. These vessels were built with accordance with the US Subsidy Act of 1891, which required the vessels to be constructed with a possibility of being converted into auxiliary cruisers in case of war, and be able to carry eleven 5 inch guns. Merida was the first of these vessels and was laid down at the William Cramp & Sons' Kensington Yard in Philadelphia (yard number 332) and launched on 25 January 1906, with Miss Florence Alker, daughter of Mr. Alphonse Alker, and a granddaughter of James E. Ward, founder of the Ward Lines, serving as the sponsor. The ship had 4 decks, and was designed to provide luxury accommodations for 189 first-class passengers, including the smoking room on the upper deck, a drawing room, library and social hall. In addition, the vessel  had all the modern machinery fitted for quick loading and unloading of cargo, had seven watertight bulkheads, and also had electrical lights installed and was equipped with the De Forest system of wireless telegraphy.\nThe initial sea trials were held on April 2\u20133, 1906 off Cape Henlopen, during which the steamer was able to reach maximum speed of 18.75 knots (21.58 mph; 34.73 km/h) over several runs, which was well over the contractual speed of 15.0 knots (17.3 mph; 27.8 km/h). After successful completion of ocean trials three days later, the ship was transferred to her owners and departed for New York on April 11.As built, the ship was 400 feet 0 inches (121.92 m) long (between perpendiculars) and 50 feet 2 inches (15.29 m) abeam, a depth of 17 feet 5 inches (5.31 m). Merida was assessed at 6,207 GRT and 3,824 NRT. The vessel had a steel hull, and two sets of triple-expansion steam engines, with cylinders of 28-inch (71 cm), 46-inch (120 cm) and 76-inch (190 cm) diameter with a 42-inch (110 cm) stroke that provided a combined 749 nhp and drove two screw propellers, and moved the ship at up to 17.0 knots (19.6 mph; 31.5 km/h).\n\n\n== Operational history ==\nUpon delivery Merida sailed from Philadelphia for New York on April 11, 1906, and after loading, departed on her maiden voyage on April 21 for Havana. After embarking on cargo and 206 passengers she left Cuba on April 28 and arrived in New York on May 1 after 2 days and 18 hour long uneventful journey, bringing her maiden voyage to a successful ending. Among her first passengers were Alfred Smith, manager of the Ward Line, who made a round-trip voyage, Lionel Carden, British Minister to Cuba, Countess Wachmeister, and Daniel Bacon, Havana-based ship operator.Commencing with her second trip and through the end of her career Merida would be serving on the same route, taking her from New York to Vera Cruz and Progreso in Mexico and then continuing to Havana before returning to New York. Besides passengers and mails, the steamer was carrying a large variety of general cargo from Mexico and Cuba ranging from exotic things such as alligator skins, jalap and fustic to hemp, coffee, pineapples, mahogany, rubber, tobacco and cigars. Starting from 1908 the vessel also began carrying Mexican silver from the port of Vera Cruz. For example, on May 16, 1908 Merida brought to New York 160 bars of silver in addition to 200 passengers and a large miscellaneous cargo. With improving silver prices and increased production, the silver exports grew in 1909-1910 too, for instance on March 18, 1910 the steamer brought 256 silver bars in addition to other general cargo. With the eruption of Mexican Revolution in November 1910, silver exports nearly doubled, reaching 452 bars when Merida arrived in New York on November 25, 1910.On January 21, 1911 Merida arrived at New York significantly delayed due losing her port side propeller approximately 160 miles out of Havana. The vessel soon returned to service after completion of the repairs.\n\n\n=== Sinking ===\nMerida left for her last journey from New York on April 20, 1911 heading for her usual destinations. After embarking cargo and most of her passengers (89) at Vera Cruz, most of them Americans fleeing the violence in Mexico, she left the port for her return trip on May 4. The steamer called at Progreso to take on more cargo and more passengers (22), including Archbishop of Yucat\u00e1n Mart\u00edn Tritschler y C\u00f3rdoba and his brother and secretary Guillermo, and continued to Havana, which she departed on May 9 after taking on board additional cargo and 77 more passengers. Due to ongoing turmoil in Mexico and with anticipated resignation of President Porfirio D\u00edaz, many wealthy Mexicans boarded US-bound ship to wait out the revolution abroad. Merida was under command of captain Archibald Robertson and had a crew of 131 men. Overall, the steamer had 131 first-class, 32 second-class and 25 steerage passengers on board, and her cargo consisted of general merchandise such as coffee, hides, tobacco, mahogany, fruit and additionally she carried 372 silver bars and 36 bars of mixed silver, as well 699 copper bars used as ballast. On May 11 the ship reached Virginia coast and continued north by east. The night was dark with calm seas, and around midnight she encountered a fog bank. The speed was dropped down to about 7 or 8 knots with the ship staying her course. At about 00:15, while roughly 52 miles east and one half mile north off Cape Charles, a lookout spotted a steamer suddenly appearing out of the haze. As the distance between the vessels was very short, no action could really be taken to avoid the collision, and the incoming steamer, later identified as a fruit boat Admiral Farragut on passage from Philadelphia to Port Antonio in ballast, crashed abaft amidships into the port side of Merida, knocking out her engines and disabling her electrical dynamo. Merida's operator, Herbert O. Benson, was able to send a distress signal and was able to reach Hatteras station, but about ten minutes after the collision the ship went completely black as her electricity supply was drained. Passengers jumped out of their cabins in their night clothing and the panic ensued but the crowd was quickly brought down under control by the captain and the officers of the steamer. Six lifeboats were launched and two rafts were dropped and all passengers and crew were able to disembark the ship.Meanwhile, Admiral Farragut suffered severe damage to her bow, but her fore collision bulkheads held and she remained afloat and was standing by. Unfortunately, her own wireless apparatus went broken due to collision and could not be used. All passengers and the entire crew, with the exception of the captain, first officer and 4 others, who stayed on board Merida, were transferred to Admiral Farragut without an incident. Only one passenger, a wife of a wealthy Mexican hemp grower Augusto Peon, was injured in the collision, possibly because she was in the cabin closest to the point of impact. Herbert O. Benson (incorrectly reported as Perry E. Benton in some newspapers) was sent by captain Robertson aboard the fruit freighter and together with her operator, A. C. Leech, was able to repair the malfunctioning wireless, and a distress signal was sent out seeking help around 05:30. Fortunately, due to collision being so close to the coast, four ships, Old Dominion steamer Hamilton, battleship Iowa, and torpedo boats Stringham and Bailey, were in the immediate vicinity, and they all responded to the calls for help. Hamilton was about 45 to 50 miles and Iowa was approximately 55 miles north, while torpedo boats were roughly 60 miles south of the place of the collision. Captain Robertson and the rest of the crew finally left the sinking Merida at 05:30 and by 05:50 she went down, sinking in approximately 35 fathoms (210 ft) of water. Both Iowa and Hamilton arrived shortly after 08:00, after navigating through heavy fog. Due to precarious position of steamer Admiral Farragut a decision was made to transfer an entire Merida's crew and passengers to the steamship Hamilton and the second transfer was initiated at about 08:45 and finished by approximately 10:45 with Iowa's cutters aiding in finishing the rescue operation. Both torpedo boats also arrived at the scene and stood by ready to help. Eventually, Hamilton departed the area and arrived at Norfolk at around 19:00. Admiral Farragut remained on site of the collision for a while trying to patch up damage as much as possible, before slowly proceeding to Delaware Breakwater accompanied by Iowa.A hearing was held in Norfolk following the collision and sinking, however, both captains were exonerated of any blame due to a sudden onset of unusual atmospheric conditions which made an accident unavoidable.\n\n\n== Treasures of Merida ==\nAt the time of Merida's loss her total value including the ship and the cargo was estimated to be approximately US$2,000,000. After the sinking many Mexican refugees claimed they carried significant amount of cash and jewelry, obviously undeclared, in their luggage or on their persons. Some claimed they deposited their valuables in the ship's safe which went down with the vessel. Rumors of hundreds of thousands of dollars on board the ship soon translated into a belief that the ship's cargo was significantly more valuable that first thought and many more attempts would be made over the years to retrieve the treasure. At some point in 1916, another rumor appeared that Merida carried crown jewels and famous rubies belonging to Empress Carlota being smuggled out of Mexico, which roughly doubled the value of presumed treasure. After the inquiry commission refused to put blame on the American Mail Steamship Company, a lessee of Admiral Farragut, owners of Merida filed a libel lawsuit for US$1,800,000 in the New York District Court. Out of this total, US$237,500 was for the silver bars, US$90,000 for mahogany logs and US$25,730 for copper bars. The bulk of the claim was for the vessel herself, amounting roughly to US$1,200,000. On March 15, 1912 a decision was rendered by the court ordering American Mail Steamship Company to pay only US$105,000 to the New York & Cuba Mail Steamship Co., citing the limitation of liability.As Merida sank at the depth considerably exceeding one reachable by divers at the time, about 100 ft (30 m), underwriters had to look for inventors involved in design of apparatus capable to conduct such work. The first contract was awarded to captain Williamson, an inventor of a special submarine tube caisson which according to him would allow a person to submerge down the tube to significant depths and be able to extract valuable cargo. That project went nowhere and the first serious attempt to raise Merida was not attempted until July 1916. An expedition was organized by the Interocean Submarine Engineering Co., headed by the retired Rear Admiral Colby M. Chester, and led by the famous diver George D. Stillson. The effort was financed by several Wall Street financiers, including Percy Rockefeller, James A. Stillman and Charles H. Sabin. As the wreck position was only vaguely known to the members of the expedition they spent more than two months searching for the wreck and finally gave up in early October 1916 due to worsening weather failing to locate it.In 1917 Brooklyn engineer Benjamin Franklin Leavitt patented and successfully tested his underwater armor suit during the salvage work he did on SS Pewabic which sank in Lake Huron in 1865. In 1920 Leavitt turned his attention to Merida and other treasure ships and attempted to organize an expedition, but failed to get financial backing. Instead, a group of wealthy New Yorkers incorporated as the H.L. Gotham Corp. attempted to raise the vessel in 1921. They employed three very experienced divers including Frank Crilley and even claimed they located the wreck but the onset of bad weather forced them to abandon their effort in late November after a series of accidents without yielding any results after almost three months of work.Merida had to wait until 1924 when a group of prominent New Yorkers including Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, Jr., Franklin I. Malory, W. Heyward Drayton, and John S. Ball chartered several trawlers and about 30 men with several experienced divers, including Frank Grilley among them, to attempt to find the treasures. After starting their work in early October they were able to find the wreck of Merida after a couple weeks of dragging, and divers were able to examine it. However, an onset of bad weather yet again halted the salvage operations and on November 22 it was reported that the group had to abandon their work until next spring. The search resumed on June 8, 1925 and after two about to weeks of dragging, the wreck was located again in 213 feet (65 m) of water on June 21. One of the divers descended down in armor suit for examination, and ascertained the hulk was indeed that of Merida. The ship was found in an approximate position of 37.24\u00b0N 74.32\u00b0W\ufeff / 37.24; -74.32 consistent with what was derived by the commanding officers of the vessel at the time of the collision. Merida was found to be laying on her side on a hard ridge embedded in about 16 feet of hard sand which blocked access to the strong room, located amidships the vessel. In addition, strong undercurrents were encountered halfway down to the bottom making divers' descent dangerous and forcing suspension of salvage work on a  few occasions. The salvage work had to be suspended at the end of September after arrival of bad weather, and even though plans were made to resume the operation next spring, they never materialized.The arrival of the Great Depression postponed any further attempts to raise the steamer, and it was not until 1931 that a new expedition was contemplated, this time by Sub-Ocean Salvage Corp., formed by several well-known New Yorkers including Vincent Astor, Lyttleton Fox, Rhinelander Stewart, Albert Gallatin and E. Vail Stebbins. The expedition was headed by famous American engineer, inventor, showman and adventurer captain Harry L. Bowdoin, and the dive work was to be led by John Dahl. By mid-August 1931 the financial backers decided not to pursue the salvage and the expedition was postponed. It took about a year for captain Bowdoin to find new sponsors, and the work finally started in summer of 1932, with the divers being able to locate the hulk in August. The work continued for another month and abruptly ended in early October, when the crew refused to go out to sea due to unpaid wages. The conflict was soon temporarily resolved, and the salvage attempts resumed in November, with the divers again finding the wreck and blasting a hole in her side to access the strong room. However, with the chief diver, John Dahl, soon dying from \"heart complications\" (most likely \"the bends\") and with weather turning bad, and crew still unpaid the efforts to raise the treasure came to an end.In April 1933 captain Bowdoin returned to Norfolk to resume his search only to discover a local rival group consisting of captain John Hall, diver Klass Evarts and Peter Mikkelson were ready to depart on the treasure hunt of their own. Swiftly filing an injunction in the local court, captain Bowdoin and his well-armed crew (or so they claimed) immediately left Norfolk to the wreck site to guard it against the intruders at all costs. After the wreck was found, the situation escalated with both parties attempting to interfere with other's efforts and resulted in US Coastal Guard sending their cutter Davis on May 8 to the wreck site in order to keep the situation after control. Hall soon abandoned his search and instead filed a lawsuit asking the court to grant him an exclusive access to the wreck site. While the legal battle continued, Bowdoin reported on July 21 that his expedition was able to raise the purser's safe from Merida' strong room. The safe was immediately arrested by the US Customs upon arrival in port and was kept in their custody through the duration of legal proceedings. In August a few American and Mexican coins were brought to port together with a waiter's badge proving the wreck indeed belonged to Merida. Continuing with their search the divers were able to examine the strongroom and claimed they have found nothing of value in it. Furthermore, Bowdoin claimed the safe was found open and contained only a few keys and worthless papers. Under such circumstances the expedition was terminated in early October. The legal battle continued through early part of 1934 and was finally decided in favor of captain Bowdoin. Following its outcome, he started planning another expedition and was about to depart for Norfolk to resume the search when he suddenly died in August 1935.\nAnother attempt was made by the New York Salvage Co. in 1936 but their schooner Constellation ran into a gale soon after departing New York and sustained considerable damage including a lost anchor forcing the expedition to return for repairs and subsequently cancelling it altogether.In May 1938 a 500-ton Italian salvage ship Falco departed Spezia for Norfolk carrying the first foreign expedition headed by captain Luigi Faggian in search of Merida's treasures. The work started on June 27 but progressed very slowly due to frequent stormy weather, nevertheless the divers were able to bring up a few minor items to the surface, such as dishes, thermometers and a few coins. Merida was claimed to be badly damaged by previous expeditions using dynamite indiscriminately with her upper decks completely collapsed. The divers were able to get to within 12 feet of the strong room, but the work was halted and abandoned in early September due to stormy weather and poor underwater visibility caused by the ongoing hurricane season. The search resumed in April 1939 and this time the expedition was able to get inside the strong room, only to find it absolutely empty. A 2-pound silver ingot worth US$7.20 was the only treasure that Falco's expedition was able to discover by August 1939, and after spending close to US$100,000 the Italians abandoned their search and returned to Italy. With the start of World War II all tries to find Merida's treasure were put on hold for a very long time.\nThere were no any further large scale attempts to raise the presumed fortunes hidden in Merida's wreck. The treasure-hunting organization Gulfstream Ventures secured legal control over the wreck site in 2013 by \"arresting\" the vessel through court order but have yet to recover any valuables.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.  It joins M\u00e9rida with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Valladolid and ultimately Canc\u00fan.\nM\u00e9rida-Tizim\u00edn (Federal 176) connects M\u00e9rida with Tizim\u00edn (2nd. largest city in Yucat\u00e1n).\nM\u00e9rida-Teabo-Peto known as Mundo Maya Road Carretera del Mundo Maya, its utilized in both \"convent route\" Ruta de los Conventos, and linking the ancient maya city of Mayap\u00e1n and Chetumal, state capitol of Quintana Roo\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

          "It is a very local attraction with lots of families visiting from the area. It has a lot of snack bars and places to buy trinkets and sweets. There is a great train ride around the park which only costs $1 each. There are numerous amusement rides as well as paths to walk",

          "I went to the zoo to see animals we don't have in Europe. And i regret going because I like to see animals especially wild ones treated right and with good living conditions. Which was definitely not the case there. I think that with the amount of visitor the zoo should improve",
          "Our two kids aged 12 and 10 loved the zoo and seeing he locals at play. A really interesting experience with good collection of well kept animals. Good little train ride too. They have great collection of both g cats and if you go now you can see some baby ocelots!",

          "The place was not modern and sofisticated, but in its simplicity it was Amazing. A great experience!",
          "Absolutely heart breaking as these animals are clearly suffering. Tiny cages, lack of shade and water in the baking heat. Hippos don't have enough water to submerge and clear evidence the sun is burning them causing pigmentation marks. The baby was trying desperately to go on",

          "A depressing, horrible place. Animals are in tiny cages, there is no enrichment whatsoever or stimulation for the animals - not even trees, and it is right next to a main road. There are zebras locked in what is basically a basketball court. Why anyone would go here, let alone",

          "Big for a park, small for a zoo. Big areas for children to play in although sadly not very green due to the hot temperatures. Not much variety in the animals, but those that they do have are well kept.",
          "This was a good activity as it was free and I didn't know which way the weather was going to go but I felt the conditions that the animals were kept in was atrocious. The enclosures were far too small for all the animals and overall wasn't a pleasant experience",
          "Don't usually care for zoos. However this was very humane and the caretakers very kind.One thing I felt was cool was being able to stand on different platforms that allowed better interaction. For example, the giraffe platform was high enough to look directly into the girafe's",

          "Merida is a city of approx. 800000 to a million people and the average property tax is around $30.00 US. With such a small resource for funds, this free admission zoo is fantastic. In my opinion, the animals are healthy and there are many varieties to view. Albeit some of the",
          "The animals are very healthy and well cared for, I was really impressed by their large cats - they had a lot of them, and all of them were well cared for and loved. They even had hippos, a giraffe and lions and tigers, oh my! Really a great zoo, I felt I should leave a donation",
          "We had 3 and 1 year old we went here twice cause it loved it so much. I have to say the train ride was probably one of the best, you get to see the zoo animals and its a nice big loop. The play area is great. Highly recommend break from normal touristy things. And its rally",

          "Don't visit this place! Being kept in small cages, many of the animals are showing severe abnormal behaviour. It was extremely sad to see them in such state and we were depressed after this trip.",
          "It's a nice place to visit. It's a municipal zoo, not private, and it's free. The size of the cages can be somewhat distressing but the animals seem in good shape. There's a nice variety of animals, the employees are friendly and there are play areas for the kids.",
          "This is a great zoo located in Merida. Lots of animals and a very clean park. Great place to spend the day.",
          "After reading the many negative posts here about the place, I was ready for the depths of inconsiderate human depravity. Sorry, folks. I've seen far worse in our civilized north. This is a small city-funded facility that does the best it can to feed and house the many animals",
          "It has a train that goes around the zoo. Just jump on the train (it is not expensive), look around and you are ready to go. The animal section is not good at all.",
          "We have not been to a zoo in over 30 years and really enjoyed the visit.Attractive landscaping and well maintained and the animals, etc seem well taken care of. We enjoyed the excitement of the children and look forward to returning with friends with children in the future.",
          "This is your typical mexican park, I do not think its great for touists. The grounds are dirty, kids are playing in revolving disgusting water. The train was ok my daughter enjoyed it. The zoo was absolutely horrible. Each aminal is cages with little to nothing resembling real",
          "We brought our kids here because it topped a lot of lists of fun things to do in Merida. The park was great and my nearly 3 year old son had a blast. but the zoo was so completely awful that we left quickly, and I found myself nearly in tears. The enclosures were tiny little",
          "I am not sure what planet the people giving this place above a 1 rating live on, but I look forward to the day I do not have to share it with them. The poor animals in this zoo are kept in very small enclosures and have no stimulation, apart from watching people leer at them",
          "This zoo should be shut down and condemned. Shame. I understand you're a poor country and what not, but it's awful to see the way these animals, and some endangered, are kept and treated. Cages aren't even big enough to turn around in. Filthy grounds. Many wounded and uncared",
          "I went to this exhibition of misery because I thought it was a BOTANICAL GARDEN , it is not. What I saw was pathetic animals packed into small cages, pacing back and forth or lying motionless on the dirt, it was disturbing. The saddest of all was this huge primate sitting alone",
          "I had low expectations for a free zoo in Mexico, but this was actually a fun visit! Great selection of animals, including what had to be at least 8 tigers. I was truly impressed by the exotics they had! In addition, many of them are very playful and fun to watch. On the",

          "We spent hours here. The whole zoo is so well done you wonder how it can be free. The variety of animals is also impressive. Rather large hippos and an assortment of cheeky primates were some favorites. There were many lions and quite a few tigers. They have quite the",

          "While I think that Zoos that aren't in the animals best interest should be banned, from a selfish point of view I had a great time at Merida zoo. Its free and there were so many happy children there. While the enclosures were not largest in most cases the animals were paired",
          "While small, this zoo is a real treat. You get to be up-close-and-personal with a variety of animals. The monkey house is a treat and so is the aviary. Best thing.....it is free. Avoid it on weekend or when school is not in session because it will be packed.",
          "This marvelous park and zoo is one of Merida's treasures. I always love to return here. It remains a unique park in Merida where families go every weekend to enjoy the ride on the train around and through the zoo, and other lovely rides for children. I am lucky to live close",
          "I do rescue work here in the Yucatan with dogs and cats so to see big animals like zebras, giraffes, etc. in tiny exclosures with minimal life support is not oniy depressing - it's criminal! I admit I have a particular fondness for cats and to this day I have nightmares about",

This zoo if pretty small, but admission is free, the park is breathtaking, and the animals--even",
          "This zoo is a travesty. The enclosures are unkempt, stinky, the water dirty and the animals look awful. There was a zebra with an injured hoof, and we unfortunately saw one of the jaguars vomiting. The playground and fountain are worth visiting if you're traveling with",

          "I loved this park. It is right in the middle of the city and big and beautiful. The mature tropical foliage and huge trees were as breathtaking as the animals. It was much more than I expected and and a very interesting. I loved the big cats. We actually did not allow enough",
          "Yes, this is a zoo; yes, it is an anachronism by modern zoo design standards; yes, many of the enclosures are hard to view - all of that said, it is a huge park, right in the middle of a bustling city of almost 900,000 people and it's totally free. Most of the visitors are",

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.  It joins M\u00e9rida with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Valladolid and ultimately Canc\u00fan.\nM\u00e9rida-Tizim\u00edn (Federal 176) connects M\u00e9rida with Tizim\u00edn (2nd. largest city in Yucat\u00e1n).\nM\u00e9rida-Teabo-Peto known as Mundo Maya Road Carretera del Mundo Maya, its utilized in both \"convent route\" Ruta de los Conventos, and linking the ancient maya city of Mayap\u00e1n and Chetumal, state capitol of Quintana Roo\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.  It joins M\u00e9rida with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Valladolid and ultimately Canc\u00fan.\nM\u00e9rida-Tizim\u00edn (Federal 176) connects M\u00e9rida with Tizim\u00edn (2nd. largest city in Yucat\u00e1n).\nM\u00e9rida-Teabo-Peto known as Mundo Maya Road Carretera del Mundo Maya, its utilized in both \"convent route\" Ruta de los Conventos, and linking the ancient maya city of Mayap\u00e1n and Chetumal, state capitol of Quintana Roo\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

        "wiki": "Fernando Garcia Ponce (1933\u20131987) was a Mexican architect and abstract artist who belonged to the Generaci\u00f3n de la Ruptura. Garc\u00eda Ponce is best known for his abstract paintings and collages, most of which utilize structured and geometric forms rather than organic shapes.\n\n\n== Life ==\nGarc\u00eda Ponce was born in M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico on August 25, 1933 to Juan Garc\u00eda Rodes, immigrant from Spain, and Mar\u00eda \"Monina\" Ponce G. Cant\u00f3n, a member of the so-called \"casta divina\" of Yucat\u00e1n. At the age of 11, Garc\u00eda Ponce's family moved to Mexico City. In 1952, Garc\u00eda Ponce enrolled at the National Autonomous University of Mexico to study architecture.In 1967, Garc\u00eda Ponce met the French Canadian actress Denise Brosseau, who had previously been married to Alejandro Jodorowsky. Brosseau and Garc\u00eda Ponce married and had one child, Esteban Garc\u00eda Brosseau.On July 11, 1987, Garc\u00eda Ponce died of a heart attack in Coyoac\u00e1n, Mexico City; Garc\u00eda Ponce was 54 at the time.His elder brother, Juan Garcia Ponce, was a well known author and has published works about his brother's art and life.\n\n\n== Works ==\nGarc\u00eda Ponce's artwork is inspired by the cubist experience. The artist chose to work through depersonalization and the search of purity. Later, he became more focused in exploring the balance between form and space. His goal was to push his artwork past its initial appearance to the viewer.\nGarc\u00eda Ponce has allowed for his paintings to speak for themselves. His artworks are living spaces animated by the artist's spirit.\u201cSince his first exhibition, Fernando Garcia Ponce showed that his paintings could be presided over by a sign of rigor. Influenced by cubism, his early works clearly displayed the feeling that had determined the choices of painters before him. Before Braque or Picasso, the memory of Juan Gris. Facing the temptation to include the complete reality of the object in the closed atmosphere of the painting, facing the creative liberty and the will to transform, the painter would choose depersonalization, the search of final purity of which is capable of formal representation. His cubism was, in the most profound sense, analytic.\u201d\u201cHis paintings are simple and difficult, empty spaces, spaces made alive through the presence of the creator\u2019s spirit that becomes incarnated in the work.\u201dSome of his works are:\n\nSelf-portrait (1951)\nNatural Death (1959)\nPainting A-63 (1963)\nBottling Peninsula, ca (1966)\nRelief and Space (1970)\nHomage to Picasso (1976)\nGlory and Death (1980)\nHorizontal Composition with Red Point (1986)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nPonce, Juan Garc\u00eda.

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.  It joins M\u00e9rida with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Valladolid and ultimately Canc\u00fan.\nM\u00e9rida-Tizim\u00edn (Federal 176) connects M\u00e9rida with Tizim\u00edn (2nd. largest city in Yucat\u00e1n).\nM\u00e9rida-Teabo-Peto known as Mundo Maya Road Carretera del Mundo Maya, its utilized in both \"convent route\" Ruta de los Conventos, and linking the ancient maya city of Mayap\u00e1n and Chetumal, state capitol of Quintana Roo\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

          "On exhibit during our stay were amazing textiles and pottery. New show coming up will focus on Oaxaca after February 24th. Sad to miss this. The introduction video was in Spanish, English subtitles would have been nice but it was put together beautifully. Museum is small but",
          "Usually I like small museums to the extreme. I like a museum that is just right in terms of size. This museum hits on most of my happy buttons - well laid out, with a nice collection of a range of popular art forms (ceramics and textiles plus some handicrafts), and small",

          "Free to get in and definitely worth a visit if you're in Merida. Small, takes up to an hour - the lovely staff give you a guide book in English but you don't need it to appreciate the art. Great costume and textiles, ceramics etc.",

          "I think this little museum is often overlooked because it is a little further from the main plaza, but I find it a delightful display of Mexican folk art. It is free and always a nice refreshing reprieve from the heat since it is air conditioned. It is 2 stories of folk art and",

          "Don't understand why the guide book referred to this as having pop art - it's folk art, much of it from the fabulous Banamex foundation. The permanent display covers every state, just about - embroidery from Chiapas, Oaxaca, pottery from Jalisco. And the special installation, of",
          "The bulk of this small museum on two floors is devoted to contemporary pottery in traditional folk styles from many regions of Mexico. It is free and air-conditioned. Two of the 7 rooms are for temporary exhibits: when we visited it was an interesting seasonal display of",
          "If you like Mexican folk art, this is a must see. Although small, the museum has a fabulous selection of pottery, fabric and metal crafts from around Mexico in its permanent display areas. There is also an area downstairs for temporary exhibits. Great staff, housed in",
          "This little gem of a museum is right next door to Los Almendros restaurant.....the original ....not the one in the Fiesta Americana hotel. This museum is well worth your time. For those of us who need English there are guide books that describe each room. Furthermore, each",
          "It should be #487 on 50-A, intersecting with 57. The address on this TA website would bring you to 53 and 50.",
          "Nice small museum filled with great folk art. We saw a special exhibition of nativity scenes because we visited in late December. They receintly move a block away from whot is listed on the tourist maps, but ask people and they will help you find this wonderful little place.",
          "I guess we thought that the exhibit at this museum would be the same every time, however they have varied artist and subject matter. We happened upon the Tonalo ceramic exhibit when we were there, and we happen to have a piece by one of the artists, so it was a successful visit!",
          "They are trying, so lets give them an A for effort, but by and large, not a great Museum, we wanted to cool off for a while and thought this would be nice but it was very elementary and mediocre.sorry...",
          "A great free museum, with friendly staff, helpful information, and a wide collection of folk art. It's definitely worth the trip if you haven't been to similar museums in other parts of the country. The items in the collections are very similar (some are identical) to the museum",
          "This is a small but lovely museum 10 minute walking time from the main square (Zocalo) and Cathedral, on the corner of a little sleepy square. The museum is free and only comprises 7 rooms for the permanent collection + 2 rooms for special exhibits, and so will not take you more",
          "Unbelievably sweet and friendly docent who did not speak a word of English, but was adorable. This museum is a gem. It was my only not-to-miss destination and I was correct in that assumption. Finely crafted textiles, embroidery, weaving, basketry and hats, carvings, masks,",
          "This small museum contains a wide range if first class costumes and artifacts from all over the country. It is sadly underutilized as we were the only guests to visit one day. Well worth a trip if you are in the vicinity.",
          "This museum is free and it is quite interesting. Some of the pieces show the most amazing detail. There are some quintessential works that represent Mexico. There were many styles that were unfamiliar to us as well. It was very colorful.",
          "Don't need to be big to be great. A great cross-section of fine Mexican folk art. Do not miss the Nativity Room off the entrance and the amazing piece that appears to be fine stitch work but is actually thousands of tiny feathers. Upstairs, the galleries have some of the finest",
          "And the building is interesting, architecturally. If you are crazy about Xmas, you'll love all of the different under-the-tree holy family sets.",

          "I wandered in to get out of a rainstorm, and was happy I did. Museum is small, maybe 5 or 6 rooms of regional art from around the country. Worth a visit if you are in the area and have 30 minutes to spare. It's free!",
          "I probably wouldn't have liked it at all if it hadn't been free. Just because it's hanging on a wall doesn't make it art. It's all in the eyes of the beholder, I suppose. Not sure how folded up paper gets to be classified as art, however. There were some really great",

          "It's easy to miss this place, tucked on a corner of a small plaza a short stroll away from the main tourist haunts, but it's well worth visiting for the amazing range of folk art on display. There's a wide range of gruesome (but fun) papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 skeletons, intricate ceramic",

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida, officially known as Santiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida, is the capital of the municipality of Libertador and the state of M\u00e9rida, and is one of the main cities of the Venezuelan Andes. It was founded in 1558 by Captain Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez, forming part of Nueva Granada, but later became part of the Captaincy General of Venezuela and played an active role in the War of Independence.\nThe capital city's population is 204,879 inhabitants, and the metropolitan area, that includes the municipality of Libertador, reaches 345,489 people (Census 2001). The city accounts for 28% of the total population of M\u00e9rida State, which has more than 750,000 inhabitants (Census 2001). It is home to the University of Los Andes and the Archdiocese of M\u00e9rida. It also has the highest and longest cable car in the world. It is the largest student and tourist center of western Venezuela. The mass transit system (Troleb\u00fas M\u00e9rida) is available as a means of tourist transport.\nThis city sits on a plateau nestled in the valley of the Chama River, which runs from end to end. The town of M\u00e9rida is located at an altitude of 1,600 metres (5,200 feet). As background on the horizon rises the country's highest summit: the Pico Bol\u00edvar with an altitude of 4,981 metres (16,342 feet).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nM\u00e9rida was founded by Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez on October 9, 1558 in one of the Pamplonian mining expeditions he led. The first settlement of M\u00e9rida was not the current one but 30 kilometres (19 miles) to the south, in Xam\u00fa, where today stands Lagunillas. Nevertheless, in November 1559, Juan de Maldonado moved the settlement to nearby El Punto (presently the Zumba area), because of constant confrontations with the native neighbours.Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez's foundation had not been authorized by the New Granadian Authorities, so in 1560 they sent Juan de Maldonado to arrest Juan Rodr\u00edguez and regularize the new city. On June 24 Maldonado moved M\u00e9rida to its present location on the plateau and rechristened it as Santiago de los Caballeros. The city then came to be governed by the corregimiento of Tunja until 1607, when it became itself a corregimiento of the Audiencia of Santa Fe.In 1622, M\u00e9rida became the capital of the Governorate of M\u00e9rida, whose chief official established his residence there. The city and territory were part of New Granada until 1777, when it was integrated into the Captaincy of Venezuela.\nThe city was elevated to the status of an episcopal see in 1785. This led to the creation of a seminary, which in 1811 became the University of the Andes.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe city was named after the founder Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez, who called so in honor of his hometown of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.\nHowever, Juan de Maldonado renamed it as San Juan de las Nieves. In 1559 the name changed again, opting this time for Santiago de los Caballeros. Gradually, it was adopting the name of Santiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida, combining the variants that had been appointed to the city until then.\nThe word M\u00e9rida comes from the Latin \"em\u00e9rita\", from Emeritus, one who has merit, which also references to veteran Roman soldiers who were discharged from the army after completion of their mandatory service commitment. Another feature common to both the Spanish and the Venezuelan M\u00e9ridas is that in both cities, there is a tributary of the main river with the name Albarregas.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n \n\nThe city is located in the center of the Venezuelan Andes, in a wide plain in the valley of the Chama River, between the Sierra Nevada de M\u00e9rida to the southeast and the Sierra La Culata to the northwest. The old quarter of the city is on the alluvial plain known as Tatuy.\nM\u00e9rida has four principal rivers and some smaller seasonal streams in the less urbanized parts of the city, these last ones have a significant water flow only in times of heavy precipitation. The most important river is the Chama, followed by the Albarregas, which cross the plain and divide it into two parts: the Banda Occidental (west bank) and the Banda Oriental (east bank). These two rivers run from one end of the city to the other. The other two principal rivers are the Mucuj\u00fan and the Milla, which flow into the Chama and Albarregas. In the lower part of the city is found the La Rosa lake, one of some 200 lakes in M\u00e9rida State.\nIn the center of the city the terrain, located on a plain, is almost flat. Nonetheless, there is an average incline of 3 to 7 degrees, which causes a difference in altitude between the high and low parts of the city of more than 400 m (1,300 ft), the average being 1,630 m (5,350 ft) above sea level at the Plaza Bol\u00edvar. However, the areas surrounding the city are rough and uneven, situated in the valleys formed by the Chama and Albarregas rivers and the Sierra Nevada and Sierra de La Culata ranges.\nThe valley in which the city is located was formed approximately 40 to 60 million years ago with the creation of the Venezuelan Andes and its continuous erosion by the area's water systems. Its soils consist of alluvial sediment and clay. Below the city runs the major tectonic fault in the western part of the country, the Bocon\u00f3 fault, which forms part of the South American Plate.\nThe vegetation in the interior of the city consists of medium to tall trees, and ferns (Pteridophyte), located mainly near the basin of the Albarregas river. On the outskirts of M\u00e9rida, one finds non-urbanized areas, where sub-mountainous and seasonal jungle vegetation predominates. On the other hand, vast coniferous forests extend toward the south, where they were planted some years ago. Toward the north and east, one finds cloud forests.\nSignificant among the local fauna are important populations of certain small and medium-sized birds such as hummingbirds and parrots (Psittacidae), spread particularly to the south of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nM\u00e9rida lies between a tropical monsoon climate (Am), bordering on a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cwb), with cooler temperatures than other cities in Venezuela, with dry winters.  Though the emission greenhouse gases has caused a rise in temperatures, this has been less, in relative terms, than in other important cities in Venezuela, with readings that vary between 19 \u00b0C and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), with an overall average of 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F). Precipitation is heavy during the rainy season, from April to November, though the city does receive more sunshine than most cities in the Colombian Andes, since the valley is too narrow for fog to accumulate.\nVenezuela is situated in an inter-tropical zone, so that there is very little temperature variance over the course of a year. The same is true in M\u00e9rida\u2014the temperatures recorded in August are normally comparable to those measured under comparable conditions in broad daylight in January.\nOn the other hand, given M\u00e9rida's location in the interior of the country, far from the maritime coasts and the influence of the ocean, and its high altitude, the temperature variance over the course of a day is relatively high. Between day and night a difference of more than 10 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F) can be observed; this difference sometimes reaches more than 20 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F). The maximums are reached during the day, and are usually around 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), but on rare occasions exceed 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). The lower limit of daytime temperatures tends to be around 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Government ==\nM\u00e9rida is the seat of the state and municipal governments, and is also home to the Governor and the Mayor's offices, the state legislature, and the regional offices of the judicial and electoral branches. Important representatives and governors are also taken to this city to meet at an annual voting session. Moreover, 13 of the 15 prefectures of the Libertador Municipality are located within the city.\nNowadays, politics have an important role among the general population, although to a lesser extent than in the larger urban centers, and the most important government positions, including Mayor and Governor, are held by members of the official party, the Fifth Republic Movement.  Because of the great concentration of students, and the importance of the Universidad de Los Andes in local development, the positions of University Director and President of the Student Body of the University of The Andes are also of great importance within the local political scene; the first of these offices is currently filled by an opposition party member. Due to the recent suspension of the elections for President of the University Student Body, the city has seen an intense wave of protests that have left more than a dozen wounded.\nIn the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum, the city of M\u00e9rida voted against the overall trend, as at least 60% of voters opposed the continuation of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's mandate. By contrast, the majority of the rest of the population of the state of M\u00e9rida voted in favor of Ch\u00e1vez.\n\n\n=== City planning ===\n\nBecause of its location on a plateau, in a small valley, covering an area of some 10 to 15 km (6 to 9 mi) in length and between 1 and 3 km (2 mi) wide, the city now lacks additional space for urban development. Though its polygonal area covers some 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi), the city occupies a little over 25 square kilometres (10 sq mi), and the rest consists of less developed zones or areas of uneven terrain, such as mountains or hillsides.\nFor this reason, the city layout is unorganized, oriented only by the traffic axes constructed in decades past. The layout of the city center or \"Old Quarter\" is in the Spanish Colonial style, consisting of eight major avenues running east\u2013west and forty streets running north\u2013south, creating blocks of 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330 feet) per side.\nHistorically, M\u00e9rida has been characterized by less pronounced differences between socio-economic classes and for its high quality of life.  Recent years, however, owing to the economic situation confronting the country, have seen a significant increase in slums in the hills and outskirts of the city.\nThe southeastern part of the city, historically the headquarters of the large Haciendas that produced sugar cane, has for several decades undergone major urban development, consisting principally of single-family dwellings, and has grown almost to the point of joining with the city of Ejido, a bedroom community. Ejido currently extends to within less than 2 km (1 mi) of the border of M\u00e9rida, and the two cities are linked by a large avenue that goes from the neighborhoods of downtown M\u00e9rida to the outskirts of Ejido. At this point, it turns into a highway, running to the city of El Vig\u00eda, thereby uniting M\u00e9rida's metropolitan area.\nDespite the limited space available for development, M\u00e9rida has the largest proportion of green areas per capita in Venezuela, thanks to its many squares and public parks, the one surrounding the river Albarregas being particularly noteworthy. The School of Architecture of the University of the Andes puts into practice diverse proposals for creating areas protected from urban development, thereby reducing the impact of population growth on the environment.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nThere were only two neighborhoods in the city at the beginning of the 20th century. One of them was Casco Central (central quarter), located in the east bank of the plateau; which in turn was divided in various zones, identified according to the name of the local square within. The other neighborhood of the city was by the other side of the Albarregas river, in the west bank. It was known as La Otra Banda (\"the other bank\"). However, as a result of the Oil Boom, immigration and various other reasons, new neighborhoods appeared as years went by. The first to emerge were those near downtown. Then, due to the lack of real estate and in the search of quieter areas, neighborhoods were created far, at the time, from the city center. Some of these old spurs have now become part of the city. The following are the main neighborhoods of the city.\n\nBelensate\nPredominantly a higher-class neighborhood, it contains the largest and most luxurious houses in the city.\nCasco Central\nIt comprises the historic city center. It is the main commercial, cultural, and urban area, containing most  museums, libraries, churches, and retail shopping stores in M\u00e9rida.\nChama\nIt is a residential area for the middle class located in the vicinity of the Chama river. It is the lowest-altitude neighborhood in the city, situated about 200 metres (660 feet) lower than downtown. It will be connected to Casco Central via an aerial cableway planned as part of the M\u00e9rida trolleybus project.\nHumboldt\nIt is a populated neighborhood to the southwest of the city, with increasing commercial development in recent years.\nLa Hechicera\nLocated at the northern end of the city, it contains the scientific and engineering buildings of the ULA, as well as the zoo and the botanical garden.\nLa Parroquia\nThis is the current name of the village formerly known as La Punta. It shares similarities with the Casco Central, with residential and commercial zones intermingled. It contains the second Bol\u00edvar Square in the city, as well as large public high schools and sporting facilities, such as the Metropolitan Stadium and the sport complex Cinco \u00c1guilas Blancas.\nLa Pedregosa\nIt is a long neighborhood located in the valley of La Pedregosa creek. It is mainly a residential zone. Although connected to the city, it is far enough from it that its development has increased in the last decades due to the availability of suitable real estate.\nLos Curos\nThis is a popular neighborhood, almost exclusively residential, though it houses one of the few industrial zones in the city.\nPie del Llano\nSituated in the middle of the city, it surrounds the airport and local branches of a number of government offices, as well as the city Mayor's office. It is a commercial and residential neighborhood with plenty of public parks.\nAvenida 16/Campo de Oro/Santa Juana\nIt is a middle-class neighborhood located in the geographical center of the city. It borders the Tatuy mesa, which houses a number of car dealers and auto shops and, above all, the largest hospital of the city, the IHULA (Instituto Aut\u00f3nomo Hospital Universitario de los Andes)Finally, the municipality is divided (for political purposes) into parishes; thirteen of the municipality's fifteen parishes are within the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDespite being one of the largest cities in the Venezuelan Andes, M\u00e9rida has traditionally been less populated in comparison to other more rapidly growing cities in the country. At the beginning of the 19th century, the city only had about 5,000 inhabitants. The demographic growth saw no major changes until the last three decades of the 20th century, when the population tripled, from 74,000 (according to the 1971 census) to the current estimate of 214,000. The increase in number of inhabitants was mainly due to a recent exodus of farmers moving to the urban centers, a phenomenon seen all over the country. Moreover, the prestige of the University of the Andes transformed M\u00e9rida in one of the leading educational centers nationwide. As a result, the city houses an important student population from all over the country.\nAccording to the last census, performed in 2001, M\u00e9rida's population was of 204,879 inhabitants. This value does not include the population omitted by the survey, which was estimated to be about 6% nationwide. However, M\u00e9rida's metropolitan (greater) area, which includes the neighboring cities of Tabay and Ejido, houses over 300,000 inhabitants.\nIn 2006, assuming the usual natural level of growth in the area (between 2.1% and 3% annually), the population reached 230,000 inhabitants, while the metropolitan area would have reached 350,000, thanks to the high growth rate in the city of Ejido, which is one of the largest of the Andes area.\nOther estimates indicate that the actual population of the city has now reached about 250,000 inhabitants and that the metropolitan area has 350,000 inhabitants.\nThe population of M\u00e9rida is relatively homogeneous. There is, however, a large community of foreigners, resulting from the inter- and intra-continental migratory patterns of past eras. Among these there are significant groups of Italians, Portuguese, and Colombians. According to the 1990 census, a little over 4% of the population\u2013some 7,406 inhabitants\u2013is of foreign origin.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city enjoys the highest quality of life in Venezuela. In the year 2000, thirty-six health centers were located in the metropolitan area of M\u00e9rida, as follows: one type I hospital, one type III hospital, and one type IV hospital, in the city proper, plus 15 urban clinics, four of type III and 11 of type I. The area also has 18 rural clinics, 13 of type II and 5 of type I.\nAs in other respects, the Universidad de Los Andes and its buildings are closely tied to the city; the health care infrastructure consists largely of medical centers belonging to the former, in addition to private health centers. Notable among the public hospitals that offer free services is the Instituto Aut\u00f3nomo Hospital Universitario de Los Andes (IHULA), the largest in the region, as well as two smaller hospitals and a chapter of the Venezuelan Red Cross. The larger private hospitals (commonly referred to as \"clinics\") are the Clinical Hospital of M\u00e9rida, the Clinical Center, the M\u00e9rida Clinic, and the Albarregas Clinic. There are also another dozen smaller clinics.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of M\u00e9rida has one of the lowest poverty indexes in Venezuela. According to the 2001 census, 18.09% of the population lives in poverty; this figure is beaten only by San Crist\u00f3bal (17.05%) and the municipalities of Chacao (8.69%), Baruta (11.22%) and San Antonio de Los Altos (6.13%) in the state of Miranda.The city's economy has been evolving and transforming since the beginning of the 20th century. Traditionally, agriculture formed the most significant part of economic activity in M\u00e9rida, which was the distribution center for agricultural goods in the state. Furthermore, large sugar cane haciendas were located nearby; their income led to the construction of a central sugar refinery in which all of M\u00e9rida's sugar cane was processed. This refinery was eventually abandoned and has now been converted into a museum. With the construction of M\u00e9rida Cable Car, the trans-Andes highway, and the city's airport, the city's economy evolved, with the tertiary services sector\u2014especially tourism\u2014displacing the primary agricultural sector.\nTourism, dubbed the \"green industry\", is the principal source of income in the city, and one of the most flourishing industries. Touristic activity benefits from the potential offered by the Andes mountains surrounding the city, and from the city's own parks, museums, and plazas, among other features. In addition, in recent years, owing to the creation of the only free cultural, scientific, and technological zone in the country, the city has begun to develop in the field of technology, thanks also to the support of the university in this matter.\nThe city of M\u00e9rida now stands out at the national level for its low cost of living and its high (relative to cost of living) per capita income of $4,381, ninth among Venezuelan cities. The service sector contributes a large percentage of the state's income. In M\u00e9rida 82,537 people are economically active, of whom 6.67% are unemployed.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nDuring the colonial era and long after independence, the city was isolated from other parts of the country because of the lack of transportation routes to the outside world. Midway through the 19th century, the first highway was built, linking the city with the rest of the country, thereby facilitating access and vehicular traffic. After this point other routes were planned, but lack of maintenance and the nature of the terrain have caused significant interruptions in land traffic between M\u00e9rida and the rest of the country.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nThe city had one national airport, Alberto Carnevalli Airport, which is embedded in the center of the city, and once offered connections to the principal cities of the western Venezuela, such as Maracaibo and Caracas. Furthermore, this airport was one of the most active in the country, with more than 20 daily flights to and from Caracas alone. The airport was closed down however in 2009 due to the many accidents that occurred because of its difficult position within the Andes. As of 2015, Avior Airlines offers flights to Caracas. Other nearby airports, such as Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonso International Airport in El Vig\u00eda, now serve M\u00e9rida.\nThe airport was built in 1956, on the former grounds of a slaughterhouse. Commercial air service was provided by two airlines. There is also an area for private aviation, which receives various types of private flights as well as air ambulance flights, and the delivery of parcels and other valuables.\n\n\n=== Road network ===\nM\u00e9rida has four large internal roadways, which run from one end of the city to the other, and five smaller roadways. The largest is the combination of the Andr\u00e9s Bello and Urdaneta avenues. With a length of more than 8 km (5 mi), it runs from the neighborhoods of the central quarter of M\u00e9rida to the outskirts of Ejido. The other three correspond to Las Am\u00e9ricas and Alberto Carnevali avenues; 16 de septiembre and Tulio Febres Cordero avenues; and the corridor of Los Pr\u00f3ceres avenue.\nTwo national highways connect M\u00e9rida with other cities in Venezuela. The first is Troncal 7 or the Trans-Andes Highway, which runs to the city of Valera. This highway crosses the Andes by way of the valley of the Chama River, and, arriving at the region of Apartaderos, is crossed by Local 1. Finally, following the course of the Santo Domingo River, it arrives at the city of Barinas. The other national highway is the so-called Carretera La Variante. Upon arriving at the Estanques region it becomes Local 8 or Autopista Rafael Caldera. La Variante connects M\u00e9rida with El Vig\u00eda, and in turn, with the Pan-American Highway, thereby giving the city a connection with Colombia and with other important destinations, such as San Crist\u00f3bal and Maracaibo.\nIn addition to the national highways, three alternative routes exit the city of M\u00e9rida. The first, called the V\u00eda del Valle (Valley Road) links the city with the north, to various communities in the valley of the Culata, in the municipality of Santos Marquina. The second is an alternative route to the city of Ejido and other communities such as Jaj\u00ed and La Azulita; it is also a tourism route, with various lookout points facing M\u00e9rida in its initial section. A third minor route, used exclusively by rural vehicles, connects the city with the community of Los Nevados and with the Sierra Nevada National Park.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nAlong with a trolleybus rapid-transit system (still under construction and not fully open), the city relies on a vast system of urban and interurban bus routes which connect the city with its metropolitan area. The conventional bus routes traverse the various avenues of the city and cover a large percentage of the city's area. M\u00e9rida has one of Venezuela's best public transit systems; nevertheless, the system has become overwhelmed by increasing demand, and may be beginning to collapse. Among the existing routes, the route from the center of the city of Ejido to the center of the city of M\u00e9rida stands out, with a volume of thousands of passengers daily.\nThe bus routes are serviced by private companies, the majority of which are cooperatives or driver's associations, following the private model practiced in most of the cities in Venezuela. However, the prices charged are regulated by the city and supervised by the municipal organization for metropolitan transport. As is the practice throughout the country, the public transport system has special fares for senior citizens, and a student pass providing some of the lowest costs in the country.\nAfter years of study, the construction of a non-polluting mass transit system was proposed; the trolleybus was chosen as the most appropriate means of transport. Construction of the M\u00e9rida trolleybus system started near the end of the 1990s. The first line was inaugurated on June 18, 2007, with 15 of 34 proposed stations completed. This route serves Ejido and M\u00e9rida. The second line is in the planning stages and is expected to be 12 km (7 mi) long with 3 common stations alongside or crossing route 1. Route 3, an aerial cableway (originally planned to be a funicular), is a  3 km (2 mi) long route that will connect the community of Chama to a M\u00e9rida trolleybus station; construction has yet to begin. Once construction is completed, M\u00e9rida will be the first city in Latin America with under 500,000 inhabitants to have a rapid-transit system. The existing bus lines will be reorganized into 47 or so feeder routes, in order to provide better public transit to less-serviced areas.\n\n\n=== Regional transport ===\nThe only regional public transit available in M\u00e9rida is by bus. These depart from the city bus station. In addition, there are other private terminals from which private lines depart. From the central station one can take buses to destinations within the state, the region, and the rest of the country. Some of the most heavily used routes in the country start from this station, in particular, those that link M\u00e9rida with the city of Caracas. Though Venezuela is undertaking the construction of a national railway system, the IAFE, in order to link together the country, the city of M\u00e9rida is not projected to be a stop on this system: the nearest stop will be the city of El Vig\u00eda, some 60 km (37 mi) away.\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\nM\u00e9rida contains numerous historical squares, colonial houses, churches, and government buildings that make up most of its sightseeing spots. Moreover, the educational development of the city due, for the most part, to its university (ULA) has contributed to the creation of museums, libraries, and centers for scientific research, such as the Center for Astronomy Research (CIDA), located a few kilometers from the city in the mountains near Apartaderos.\n\n\n=== Monuments, public buildings, and historic places ===\nHouse of Former Governors\nThis colonial-style villa, located in the central quarter, was the official residence of the state governors.\nRectorate's Building\nSeat of the university's rectorate and Aula Magna.\nGovernment Palace\nThe government building, regional executive branch.\nPlaza Monumental Rom\u00e1n Eduardo Sandia\nThe Bullfighting Arena of M\u00e9rida was built in 1967.

In its trajectory, it ascends from the central quarter to the Sierra Nevada. Currently, it holds two world records: one for being the longest cable car system in the world (12.5 km or 7.8 mi) and another one for being the highest cable car system in the world (4,367 m or 14,327 ft). The cable car was completed in 1958. It was closed in 2008 for construction of a new cable car system. It was reopened in April 2016.\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nM\u00e9rida has about two dozen religious buildings dedicated to Christianity, the most important of which are Catholic churches and chapels, since it is the religion with most number of followers in Venezuela.\n\nCathedral of M\u00e9rida\nThe city's Minor Basilica, built in Baroque style, similar to the Cathedral of Toledo, Spain.

This was the first sculpture constructed to honor Bol\u00edvar, in 1842. It was commissioned by the then-governor of the province, Gabriel Pic\u00f3n. It was erected to commemorate the moving of Bol\u00edvar's remains to the Pante\u00f3n Nacional in Caracas, from their previous resting place in the city of Santa Marta, Colombia, where Bol\u00edvar had been buried following his death in 1830.

It has green areas, a fountain, and models of military tanks.\nParque La Isla (Island Park)\nSituated in the former location of a coffee plantation of the same name, the park was built in 1960 partly as an underwater park, and is 3.5 hectares in area. Its infrastructure is reminiscent to that of an island, offering kids play grounds, trails, and athletic courts. The park houses the largest convention center in the city, as well as the headquarters of Corpoandes (a government-run corporation that promotes development in the Andes region), facilities for cultivating orchids, and a museum dedicated to beekeeping.\nParque Las tres M\u00e9ridas (Three M\u00e9ridas Park)\nA small park that commemorates the three cities in the world named M\u00e9rida (in Spain, Mexico, and Venezuela).

It is the home of the University of the Andes, one of the most respected universities in the country, and the second to oldest. M\u00e9rida also contains various institutions of higher educations such as universities, university centers, polytechnic institutes, and university colleges, among others.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nThe University of the Andes, the most important in the city, was established in 1785, and offers undergraduate programs in art, sciences, literature, and humanities, long and short programs, as well as courses, degrees, post-graduate programs, specializations, diplomas, etc., bringing together more than 40,000 students and 6,000 professors. The university operates two campuses in M\u00e9rida, and about a dozen faculties spread throughout the city.\nTwo other more recently founded universities are based in M\u00e9rida: the Universidad Nacional Abierta (UNA), which offers undergraduate distance-learning courses; and, from 2006, the UNEFA, which is a military university specializing in Engineering for undergraduates.  The main university centers to be found in the city are given below:\n\nUniversity of the Andes (ULA)\nUniversidad Nacional Abierta (UNA)\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de las Fuerzas Armadas (UNEFA)\nSantiago Mari\u00f1o Polytechnic Institute (IUPSM)\nColegio Universitario Hotel Escuela de Los Andes Venezolanos (CUHELAV)\nSantiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida Institute (ISCM)\nAntonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre University Institute\nCrist\u00f3bal Mendoza Technological University Institute\nLa Frontera Technological Institute (IUFRONT)Primary and Secondary EducationThere are many institutions dedicated to primary and secondary education, most of which are public, under the control of the national or regional governments.  Of particular note is the Liceo Libertador. The largest education centers in the city can be found among the many private Catholic schools.  Colegio La Salle de M\u00e9rida and Colegio San Luis are among the largest with several hundred pupils each.  These are run by governing bodies Fundaci\u00f3n La Salle and Fundaci\u00f3n Don Bosco, respectively.  However, all schools come ultimately under the auspices of The Venezuelan Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n.\nOther educational institutions worth mentioning are the schools dedicated to languages, sport and music. M\u00e9rida is known as a destination to learn Spanish. In 2007 Jakera Spanish School was voted by the Language industry (STAR awards) as one of the top four Spanish schools worldwide. There are important conservatories, orchestras and choirs based in the city.  Most are linked to the universities and specialize in many kinds of instruments, as well as lyrical interpretation and the development of the singing voice. Amongst the language schools, of predominance are those that teach English, though French and Italian schools can also be found.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nThe greatest network of libraries is that of the University of the Andes. Each school has a specialized library, as well as the multidisciplinary libraries located in La Hechicera, the sports division, the administrative division, and a number of other smaller libraries, adding up to more than a dozen under the direction of Serbiula. Moreover, ULA owns the largest digital archive of the country, available to the public for research and education.\nBesides the university libraries, M\u00e9rida has the Biblioteca Bolivariana (Bolivarian Library), which is also an area of exhibits and historical displays, a branch of the National Library of Venezuela, and the public library Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, subsidized by the government. Other public and private institutions such as schools, churches, and language institutes have their own minor libraries to be used by their members.\nAdditionally, land originally set aside for a metropolitan library in 2006 was reallocated for the use of National Experimental University of the Armed Forces, and a new site for the proposed library has yet to be granted.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe city's culture closely resembles that of Andean Folklore and is in fact the main, if not defining, example of this folklore. Inhabitants of M\u00e9rida, with deep connections to their culture, are characterized by their well-preserved traditions and slow, unhurried way of life. The city itself can be recognized by its many well-preserved  colonial parks and buildings, in addition to its famous social scene, the local art and craftwork, and the unique regional cuisine.\n\n\n=== Museums, cultural centers, and theaters ===\nArchaeological Museum\nArchdiocesan Museum\nMuseum of Science and Technology\nMuseum of Colonial Art\nMuseum of Modern Art\nJuan F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez House of Culture\nTulio Febres Cordero Cultural Center\nC\u00e9sar Renginfo TheaterNot many know that the Archdiocesan Museum of M\u00e9rida houses the second and third oldest bells in the world, the so-called Ave Mar\u00eda bell from the year 909 and San Pedro of 912.\n\n\n=== Festivals and local customs ===\nIn addition to national holidays and events, several festivals take place and have origins in M\u00e9rida. Most are religious celebrations, and a few \u2013 such as the city's famous \"Feria del Sol\" or \"Sun Fair\" that takes place in the beginning of February \u2013 are of an international scale.\nFor M\u00e9rida, the most important and famous religious traditions are those celebrated by the city's Christian devotees during Christmas and Holy Week. These festivities include La Quema del A\u00f1o Viejo (Burning of the Past Year), La Pasi\u00f3n Viviente de Cristo (Christ's Living Passion) and La Paradura del Ni\u00f1o (Christ Child's Standing) celebrated with prayers, song, fireworks, wine and cake.\nAnother of the more popular local customs (those without official government sanction) are the Caravanas Estudiantiles, student processionals organized by and for high school or university graduates upon earning their degree. In recent years, this tradition has been extended to include younger students who have completed their primary or elementary education. Such celebrations usually occur during the first days of June for high school graduates, and throughout nearly the entire year for college graduates. Similar festivities can be found in other parts of the country, but the Caravanas of M\u00e9rida have a special relevance and importance given the city's large student population.\nOther customs firmly rooted in the M\u00e9ridan tradition, usually associated with fixed dates, include Patinatas Navide\u00f1as or \"Christmas skating\", which occurs in the city streets throughout the month of December; the Fiesta de las Velas on December 7 when in the evening all the electricity is turned off and some 18,000 candles are lit; the Fiesta de San Benito between January 12 and 31 celebrated with a drummers processions and street dancing; or the Vasallos de la Candelaria, another typical festivity with children and street dancing.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe cuisine of the M\u00e9rida region differs notably from that of the rest of the nation. Among the most notable differences is the arepa andina (Andean Arepa), a variant of the traditional Venezuelan arepa made from  wheat flour instead of the more common corn. This difference in ingredients is due primarily to the fact that the Andean region was one of the few places in the country where wheat historically has been harvested. Another notable dish is the pizca andina, common to M\u00e9rida, T\u00e1chira and the Colombian Andes, a soup with potato, milk, long onion, and parsley. Other important dishes are prepared with trout, the only fish found in the region.\nThe city's typical brightened sweets, made from a base of milk and other ingredients, are also notable. There is a historical tradition of such sweets, which are said to originate in the convents where they were prepared in the 19th century. Also, one can find alfajores, aliados, and almojabanas. Popular drinks include corn liquor, mistella, and \"donkey's milk\", which is known as \"Andean punch.\"\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe traditional music of the city is marked by waltz rhythms. It also includes regional or national rhythms, such as pasillos,  a type of merengue and bambucos. The music of M\u00e9rida, like its people, is recognizable by the laid back rhythms. The use of the violin and mandolin are almost mandatory in the music style.  Additionally, the city is commonly the birthplace of many rock and punk bands, among other genres. The city is also home to the M\u00e9rida State Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n== Entertainment and tourism ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is the quintessential touristic city in Venezuela, being one of the most sought-after destinations by national and international travelers.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\nLodging accommodations can be found to fit all budgets, including pensions and apartments for tourists with basic amenities. At least half of the hotels are located within the city, which is about 35% of the total number statewide.  All in all, there are about 2,650 beds available. Moreover, there will be three large five-star hotels added before 2007, when M\u00e9rida becomes the host of the soccer event Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\n\n=== Shops ===\nThe main commercial area of M\u00e9rida lies within the historic downtown. However, all kinds of services can be found in the suburbs. Two notable destinations by locals and tourists alike are M\u00e9rida's Mercado Principal (Main Market) and the Helader\u00eda Coromoto (Coromoto Ice cream Parlor). The Mercado Principal is famous for its variety of folk art, gastronomy, produce, groceries, and other local and regional goods. Helader\u00eda Coromoto is well known because it offers the greatest variety of ice cream flavors worldwide, with more than 800 choices.\n\n\n=== Shopping malls ===\nFor those who like to go shopping and spend the day enjoying stores or food courts, M\u00e9rida offers the following shopping malls: Las Tapias and Millenium located in Andr\u00e9s Bello Avenue; Alto Prado and Pie de Monte located in Los Pr\u00f3ceres Avenue; and Rodeo Plaza located in Las Am\u00e9ricas Avenue.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nAs a city with many students and tourists, M\u00e9rida enjoys a broad network of places open at night, mostly composed of clubs and bars. There are also various caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and two movie theaters. Furthermore, a number of cultural events constantly take place in these locations. Notable among these events are the concerts of the Symphonic Orchestra of M\u00e9rida, as well as concerts by local bands. Many of the night-clubs and discos open until late at night, with a few of them staying open until sunrise.\n\n\n== Media and communication ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThere are three television stations which broadcast from M\u00e9rida. Two of these are general-interest stations, airing programs including news, entertainment, and culture. The third is an institutional and educational channel and belongs to the Universidad de Los Andes.\nThe stations are:\n\nTelevisora Andina de M\u00e9rida, (TAM)\nULATV\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nThe principal radio stations of the state also broadcast from M\u00e9rida. These stations are mostly privately owned, though in recent years some public community radio stations have emerged.\n\n\n=== Press ===\nSome of the best-known newspapers from M\u00e9rida are:\n\nEl Correo de Los Andes\nCambio de Siglo [2]\nDiario Frontera [3]\nDiario Pico Bol\u00edvar [4]\nCultura Tatuy\n\n\n== Sports ==\nM\u00e9rida has a strong athletic infrastructure; noteworthy among others is the Guillermo Soto Rosa Stadium, an important soccer facility and the old headquarters of the local soccer team. During the last month of 2005, the city was host to the 2005 Andean National Games, an event for which numerous athletic facilities were built, including the Cinco \u00c1guilas Blancas (Five White Eagles) Sports Complex\u2014a 42 000-seat stadium and the current home stadium of the local team, Estudiantes de M\u00e9rida F. C.. Soccer is the most popular and widely supported sport, but given the city's location, a variety of extreme sports are also practiced as well.\nIn addition to the aforementioned soccer, the current athletic infrastructure also supports a wide array of other traditional sports, including tennis, basketball, baseball, and Venezuelan sports such as bolas criollas.\nThe Metropolitan Stadium of M\u00e9rida, dedicated on May 25, 2007 with a friendly match between Venezuela and Honduras, was host to the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\n\n== See also ==\nM\u00e9rida (state)\nLibertador Municipality, M\u00e9rida\n\n\n== References ==\nSecondary literature(in Spanish) Historia de M\u00e9rida, Carlos Chalbaud Zerpa, Universidad de Los Andes. 1985, M\u00e9rida, Venezuela.\n(in Spanish) Enciclopedia de Venezuela.

          "About 17 blocks (about 1.5km) from the Hyatt, is the old town, a flat walk, however, get a taxi if you prefer. Merida itself is only 2 stories high and I know why most hotels are blocks away! No one would want to destroy any of these lovely building, for a high rise hotel?",

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.  It joins M\u00e9rida with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Valladolid and ultimately Canc\u00fan.\nM\u00e9rida-Tizim\u00edn (Federal 176) connects M\u00e9rida with Tizim\u00edn (2nd. largest city in Yucat\u00e1n).\nM\u00e9rida-Teabo-Peto known as Mundo Maya Road Carretera del Mundo Maya, its utilized in both \"convent route\" Ruta de los Conventos, and linking the ancient maya city of Mayap\u00e1n and Chetumal, state capitol of Quintana Roo\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

          "This museum focuses on pyramids; I don't know if this was a special exhibit or what they always do. It was quite fascinating, with examples and background on pyramids all over Mexico - not just Mayan pyramids. I gained a much clearer, broader understanding of Mesoamerica, beyond",
          "If you don't have a lot of time to spend at the large Mayan museum just out of town, come here for a really wonderful mini tour of the Mayan history, as well as walking through a gorgeous mansion where you can admire the architectural components. I wasn't feeling great on day 3",

          "Interpretation of the culture and religious practices of the mexicas. Interesting artefacts. From the Templo Mayor Museum. The bee exhibit seemed out of place for this museum.",
          "May favorite part was the building itself. It was beautiful! Also, nice and cool. Great thing to do on a hot afternoon. They do have some very interesting items, just not a lot of them. They have more space in building, so hopefully more to come.",
          "Good display of Mayan artifacts, but VERY limited. Apparently most has been moved. Signage in English is limited. Took about 30 minutes to visit. We went based on the Moon handbook. Not at all as described.",

          "when we visited there was a temporary exhibits focusing on the flowers of mayan culture. I actually found it quite interesting.,but if you are coming to see mayan artifacts, this is not really the place. The building itself is lovely. It is not a huge exhibit but about right",
          "I had read that an excellent collection of Maya artifacts were held here, but when I visited in October 2017, all there was to see was a temporary exhibit focused on flowers in Mexican art. I asked at reception and it seems all the Maya art save one or two objects has been",
          "This is the top museum in Merida, in my opinion. If you only have time for one museum, make this your choice. It was built in the early 1900s by the city's mayor who resided there until he died in 1959. At that time it became a museum. I particularly love the permanent",
          "We visited the museum this week. I was a little disappointed that there weren't more Mayan artifacts on display. Overall a nice air conditioned visit though.",
          "I've visited several times and I always experience this journey back to the early 1800's, for the house is well-preserved and evokes the haciendas time period. Moreover, I've enjoyed the amazing collection of Mayan artifacts, jewelry, stelas, carved pieces brought from Chich\u00e9n",
          "There are a lot of interesting Maya artifacts here. Some of the pieces have information in both English and Spanish and some are Spanish only, so I recommend you learn a little Spanish if you have time. Dont forget to check out the stone serpent head they have because its in",
          "This museum is housed in a beautiful old colonial located right on Paseo Montejo. It has a nice collection of Yucatan anthropology.",
          "WOW! Nice museum. A bit small, but super friendly staff. Very clean. The building itself is gorgeous",
          "You can visit both to view the inside of a palace and to see the excellent collection of Mayan artefacts. Both are worth a visit.",
          "Surprisingly, for such an important museum, it is not well signposted. The building of a new hotel nearby, was! It is a splendid museum however. Entrance M$55. It's set in a fine house with elegant rooms with high ceilings, huge doors and a marble staircase. The chandeliers need",
          "Beautiful museum and a wonderful place to learn more about the area! We spent about an hour there and it was easy to get lost in the history of the local area. The book store was extensive and also worth a visit. Enjoy!",

          "We visited Merida as a part of our round trip in Mexico, and had a well-filled day program, where unfortunately were no place for the museum visit. So we went to visit this museum on our own in the afternoon and due to late time came forth just a half an hour before closing",
          "The building is beautiful, but inside there is only a small collection of artefacts with very little explanation, almost none in English. Go to the Museo Mundo Maya instead.",

          "Beautiful building, classic Spanish colonial style dating back to the late 1800 plus history and archeology of the Yucat\u00e1n. Short walk from our hotel. Very nice",

          "The Anthropology and History Museum is a good start to introduce you to Mayan civilization. You will get an overview and see some good artifacts but it doesn't compare to other museums. If you have never been to Mexico and have an interest in Mayan history definitely visit but",
          "We needed a guide, as the displays do not have English descriptions, and there are certified guides inside the entrance. Ours was very well-informed, and spoke good English. The displays make the different periods of the Mayan settlements and culture in the Yucatan. It was an",
          "We were able to see many of the Mayan sites in the Yucatan area, we travelled in this area for 5 days, it was really a great trip. This museum housed many of the artifacts that were found in the places we visited which tied everything together for me and gave me a better",
          "When we visited, the museum had an exhibit of Mayan artifacts from eastern Yucatan - sculpture, jewelry, murals, ceramics. It was interesting to see more personal relics of the inhabitants of the ancient cities we had visited.",
          "a well organised and maintained museum, the pieces are well displayed with enough information so you understand, they offer translating and guiding service. and it tells a lot about the country, history and culture.",
          "The museum is nice but the building is spectacular. Located in the center of Paseo Montejo, the facade is very well conserved. Beautiful building and nice museum.",
          "A nice museum on the Paseo Montejo. The entry is on the side of the building. It only takes an hour or so to view the exhibits. It is well laid out and provides a nice display of artifacts retrieved from archeological sites of the Yucatan peninsula. We stopped here after having",
          "Houses artifacts from three main Mayan sites in the Yucatan, including Chichen Itza. Museum is in a beautiful state owned former mansion, which is gorgeous inside. Well worth the admission of 55 pesos. Major signs in Spanish and English. Small descriptive signs in Spanish only.",
          "Not a lot of archeological pieces, but enough, Hand-selected items beautifully displayed on two floors of the marble mansion. The signage/information is in Spanish and English. Lovely gift shop and bookstore.",
          "This museum in Merida hosts various exhibits thruout the year. When we visited, theere was a Mayan masks exhibit going on. The masks were interesting and a lesson in history. It was a small exhibit. Will take about an hour- hour and a half. But, probably similar ones could be",
          "This place is a class act. The building is an old mansion which is amazing in itself and the museum is smallish and easily seen in a short visit. They only host one exhibit at a time so it's not overwhelming. We saw the new exhibit (opening Dec. 16) which was great for an",
          "Another gorgeous building on Paseo Montejo. Exhibitions change periodically, but are always interesting.",
          "Went here on a workshop/field trip with my spanish teacher. The building is a beautiful and architecturally interesting historic mansion. While I was there the main exhibit was masks of central america. It was complete and well displayed with informative signage in spanish and",
          "This is not a huge museum. The entire place was taken up with the current temporary exhibition of masks. There were masks from all over the world but most of the ones on display were Mexican. It was very interesting. The building itself is very impressive! It was built in the",
          "We visited this museum with friends in August, 2016. The exhibit at the time was one pertaining to primitive masks from around the world. Very interesting exhibit, and the museum itself was beautiful. It was, at one time, a single family home of a prominent historical person",
          "This is the older of the two state museums. It's located towards the bottom of Paseo Montejo in one of the old colonial houses. The building is very impressive and the exhibition of masks is very interesting, but unless you're in your 50s and really hark back to the times when",
          "I must say I was somewhat disappointed in this museum. I expected to see far more about anthropology in Mexico. The exhibit on masks was interesting but quite frankly was not what I had expected. If you have lots of time, it might be worth a visit but I think there are more",
          "This huge home converted to a museum is open to the public. The cost is minimal and the inside is a remarkable example of the \"good times\"life in Merida. The masquera display was full of tradition and belief. I left with an understanding of the differences and reasons for them",
          "See the history of the Maya....in the most beautiful converted mansion! I especially loved the textiles, and the evolution of Maya fabrics and embroidery. On the evening of the White Night the street was alive! And the museum was free from 6PM till 2AM!",
          "The building alone is worth the visit. That the building now apparently houses different ethnographic and/or historical exhibits makes it doubly worthwhile.",
          "This museum is filled with so many items of interest, not to mention the mansion itself is quite impressive too.",
          "With no expectations I found the museum very nice. The Guatamalan textile exhibit beautiful and informative. The history of the pre colonial Mayan city T'Ho very interesting. For for artifacts you can go to the newer Museo del Mundo Maya. This was definitely worth the 60",
          "The building housing the Anthropology and History Museum is stunning, but I wouldn't pay again to go inside. The entrance fee was steep (compared to other museums) and the exhibit was small. The current exhibit was on Mayan Traje (clothing) and it was well done. After having",
          "The museum is, well, a museum. To me it is the building that makes it so special. Wandering about the building is a joy unto itself. The displays are a bonus. Its been a while since I last visited but I do recall being a little annoyed at having to pay an entrance fee.",
          "Beautiful building, terrible museum, there is not a singe interesting piece. Would not waste my time here.",
          "As others have said, at least for March, only the Guatemalan textiles were on view. They were/are spectacular, and the display was/is equally fine. The creativity of the designs and colors, and the choices the artists made in terms of color combinations between the color of",
          "There seems to be some confusion over what this museum contains. Last year, a new Mayan Museum was built outside of Merida- all of the Mayan exhibits were moved there. This museum hosts travelling exhibits. In March 2016 it was a beautiful exhibit on Guatemalan Mayan weaving.",
          "We were looking forward to seeing the archaeological exhibits, but after paying our entrance fee (about 60 pesos each), we found that only the bottom floor was open where they were showing an exhibit on Guatemalan textiles and weaving. While the textile exhibit was interesting,",
          "Not really impressed, only took about 15 minutes to tour the whole museum. Very small with only a handful of exhibits, mostly Mayan textiles and clothing. Would definitely skip next time I'm in Merida",
          "Set in a an impressive 19th French-inspired former mansion just of Paseo de Montejo, this museum makes for a fun and educational foray into the world of Mayan history and archaeology. It's only major detraction comes from the lack of more its information in English. Otherwise,",
          "This Museum of Maya history was just the right size after Mexico Cities one. Beautiful ancient pieces extremely well displayed. The 1905 house was the perfect foil for the exhibits with lots of space. The marble staircase was very impressive. Very enjoyable.",
          "We spent about two hours at this beautiful anthropology museum housing hundred of artifacts found in the Mayan ruins. The statues, artifacts, ceramics, etc. were beautifully displayed with great explanations. Having gone to Uxmal, this museum made the ruins come to life.",
          "We paid extra for an English speaking guide which really helped us appreciate the artifacts and history of the area. If you don't have time to visit all the ruins, some of it is here. Lovely old building. Great area for a walk.",
          "Visit the Mayan archeological sites to see the buildings and large stone carvings. Come here to see the beautiful pottery and jewelry that the Mayan people made. This is a very impressive collection of Mayan artifacts.",
          "This is one of the best small museums we have ever seen. The items on display were varied, yet covered all aspects of the history of the Maya. The layout has been done thoughtfully and the lighting excellent. Other reviewers have used words like \"stunning\" and \"impressive\"",
          "This is a \"must see\" if you are at all interested in the fascinating culture of the Mayan people. There's a new, modern Mayan museum at the northern end of Merida (near the new Costco) that looks like a round, multi-colored wire basket, but we were told not to go there, by",
          "I had no intention of adding aanother book to my library at home but was so taken with the presentation and the quality of artifacts that couldn't tear myself away. It is jsut about the best Historical exhibit In that respect that I have seen in the centers of Mayan culture.",
          "This is an impressive array of Mayan art dating back to 400 AD. I was especially impressed by the craftsmanship of the various sculptures. Lots of bilingual placards available to help you understand what you're looking at. Highly recommend.",
          "The collection of this museum is housed in a grand mansion on the Paseo. The collection is beautifully laid out and displayed with wonderful Mayan artifacts. Excellent",
          "Be sure to take the time to visit this museum when in Merida. The building and it's history alone is fascinating.",
          "Very complete and representative Maya exhibit when we visited, but I believe this is a touring exhibit and only in Merida for a set period.",
          "We enjoy the Palacio Canton museum of anthropology and history. It is helpful for non Spanish speakers to hire a guide. The building is beautiful and the exhibit are nicely displayed. One can get a good understanding of the Mayan history that will help to prepare for visits to",
          "Well worth a trip! Original artifacts beautifully lit and displayed well. Sign boards give English and Spanish explanations. Nice gift shop.",
          "This is a relatively small museum that permits an up-close examination of a diverse array of works found throughout the Yucatan. The descriptions of works (some English, but mostly in Spanish) are useful, but companions who could not read Spanish were sometimes frustrated in",
          "One of the best archeological collections in Merida, rivals the much larger and better funded Gran Museo del Mundo Maya.",
          "If you want to learn about the past of the Yucatan, this is the place to visit. It is a stretch to walk from the Zocolo, but a taxi is not expensive. Go and learn!",
          "Great artifacts and historical history. Beautifully restored historical home. Centrally located on main boulevard on the Paseo Montejo.",
          "Even if you're not interested in ancient artifacts, you have to see this beautiful old mansion. A serene and cool way to spend a hot afternoon. Nice gift shop too.",
          "The Mayan artifacts were exquisitely displayed in the gorgeous former Mansion on Paseo de Montejo. I don't usually take photos in museums but this one seemed to demand memories of the beautiful Mayan sculptures. Cost 55 pesos and not crowded, even on a Saturday. We will be",
          "Well played out. In beautiful building. Not many visitors. Had so mAny artifacts, masks, etc. One of the Best museums.",
          "A nice exhibit of artifacts from several mayan sights. Not a lot of English translation so not a lot of info if not a Spanish reader. Can do it in a quick fashion as not too huge. The old colonial home is also amazing that houses the museum",
          "The collection of art and artefacts found in Mayan ruins are here. This is a wonderful exhibit and well worth the visit. It is not that large so plan on 1-2 hours to look through the whole collection at a modest pace.",
          "Really well laid out museum in a beautiful building. Features a large collection of very well preserved and presented Mayan artifacts. The interpretive panels are mainly in Spanish, so if your language skills aren't too hot, maybe take along a dictionary or google translate to",
          "The exterior and interior of this museum are beautiful. The antiquities were beautifully displayed and it was easy to move around the different exhibitions. There is a very helpful time-line display.",
          "Some expats in Merida told us that the Mundo Maya museum was better than this one but that simply wasn't true. This museum was small, well-curated, succinct and extremely informative. This is a museum that is overseen by Mexico's ministry of public education; they really care",
          "Interesting array of Mayan artefacts with special exhibitions upstairs. About \u00a32 to enter, leave backpacks on open shelf, can take photos but no flash. Very good value on the beautiful avenue",
          "This is a small museum on Paseo Montejo and worth a visit. Seeing all the stellae that are at the ruins one is often left wondering...what the hell was that? Visit this museum get a real idea of how all of those stellae looked. The best ones have been carted off to museums",
          "Each Mayan artifact displayed in this museum has high visual and cultural value. The lighting is so good that it makes it easy and a pleasure to linger over sculptural details. Pieces are mounted and displayed beautifully, a feat not often seen in other museums showing Mayan",
          "A professional guide inside the museum offered his (150 pesos) personal services. His English was superb and he escorted to each piece with much history and detail. Most of exhibit is in Spanish only. So his guidance provided an exceptional experience.The tour took about an hour",
          "If you're near this is a must visit museum... the museum is nicely arranged and the sculptures well placed.",
          "Visited on a cruise shore excursion but did not go inside. We were appreciative of the architecture and history of the former home.",
          "We opted for a personal guide to lead us through the exhibit and that most certainly added to our experience. The guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. It felt as if we were walking through many of the original sites where some of these treasures were originally found. I'd",
          "It is an amazing museum, it has a lot of important historical pieces, great way to know a little bit more about the mexican culture. And the arquitechture is simply wonderful. Do not miss it!",
          "Great place to escape the midday sun. 2 hours is plenty of time to see it all. Nice walk to it with a good bakery at the very north of the main road.",
          "A small museum situated inside a Spanish colonial palace that is jam packed with beautiful Mayan antiquities. Item specific plaques are all in Spanish with some of the more general historic information provided in English (if you have data on your phone download the google",
          "Didn't expect to enjoy this museum as much as I did. The exhibit was outstanding. Incredible artifacts and extremely interesting explanations. Most were in Spanish (which I can read pretty well so not a problem) but there were some explanatory materials in English as well. The",
          "We learned a lot of history and this is a must see if you visit Merida. Plan on spending a few hours here",
          "...but a specific interest in Mayan archeology is needed to get the most out of this museum hosted in a beautiful building- indeed the setting for these items was every bit as impressive as the items on display. 30 minutes was enough for us casual visitors.",
          "This museum is small but has very interesting displays relating to different periods of the Mayan culture. Situated on Paseo Montejo, it is easily accessible to visitors strolling along this splendid avenue.",
          "Great ferocious gargoyle faces on this beautiful building. They have excellent air conditioning for a sweltering afternoon. Amazing Mayan artifacts well light and displayed. All the labels are in Spanish so we should have hired an English speaking guide. The collection is",
          "On our second trip to Merida, my husband and I visited the museum of anthropology in Merida. We paid for our tickets, and were presented with the option of paying a little extra for a tour guide. I was a little apprehensive, but we knew it could contribute to a great experience.",
          "It is a beatiful building, but lamentably the museum is closed for repairs. There is a new modern museum at Merida, maybe this house will open with a different vocation.",
          "This is just not right. Closing some parts of a museum for refurbishment I can accept, but the whole museum for days is unacceptable. I came to Merida in part because of this museum and feel very let down. In addition no notification of closure - many people came to the building",
          "So, we were very, very excited to visit the Anthropology and History museum last summer on our first trip to M\u00e9rida. We were quite underwhelmed, however, by the few artifacts downstairs and then black and white photography exhibit upstairs. It was interesting, but it was really",
          "Very nice architecture, and some of the exhibits were interesting. When we visited, most of the downstairs was showing artworks done by the local school children. Though quaint, I would have preferred to see more of Merida/Mexico history. Still worth the visit though.",
          "This museum is in a beautiful old house. The selection is small, but expertly curated, with extensive and appropriate commentary. Some of the pottery is absolutely breathtaking. Not to be missed if you're in Merida.",
          "This fabulous museum has more than one can take in in 4 hours. Everything very well displayed, explained in English and Spanish. Many of the displays are interactive, and very entertaining.",
          "It would be worth the admission just to see inside this grand mansion, but the exhibits are well worth it, too. The lower floor was filled with gorgeous ceramics from many parts of Mexico. They are not antiques so much as beautiful pieces of art. Upstairs is a fascinating",
          "Hoped this would be a museum with a lot of historical and anthropological detail about the Mayan civilisation. Sadly it fell quite a way short. An exhibition of modern pottery on the ground floor has some beautiful pieces. Upstairs there is a slightly dry exhibit showing black",
          "it had a variety of colorful Mexican sculptures and historical pieces made of typical clay as well as a lot of marble pieces of Mayan structures like the Mayan water god \"Chaak\" and representations of how ruins used to be next to how they are at the moment at a variety of spots",
          "The Mayan culture and architecture displays are outstanding.It had a temporary exhibit of beautiful pottery from Guadalajara.",
          "This was one of the first places we visited when we arrived in Merida. There were two exhibits: the main floor had a splendid collection of diverse pottery and clay sculpture; the second floor had a detailed display of Mayan architecture from 500-900 AD. We took our time, and",
          "The extensive exhibits of Mayan and Merida culture and history are worth every penny of the about $5 entrance fee. We spent almost three hours there ewing and aging.",
          "Terrific photographs and some artifacts from all the prominent Mayan sites surrounding Merida. It definitely whetted our appetite. In the downstairs installation, a wonderful exhibit of pottery from Jalisco. The museum is housed in a grand old building, well-restored and",
          "Housed in a beautiful building, there are examples of wonderful Mexican pottery, while upstairs is a photgraphic display of many of the Mayan sites. The before and after photos are very interesting",
          "The Palacio Canton museum in a century-old mansion designed by an Italian architect houses traveling exhibits. When we visited there was a wonderful display of contemporary art pottery using traditional pottery techniques from various areas of Mexico on the ground floor. I",
          "Beautiful neoclassical residence converted into a museum, great collection on Mexican ceramics/pottery stunning. also while I visited a great exhibit on Mayan architecture.",
          "The first floor is all art and the second floor is about Mayan architecture. I'm not a huge art buff, so I can't comment on that aspect. I would recommend seeing a few of the surrounding ruins before going. The museum specifically discusses ruins along the Ruta Puuc: Uxmal,",
          "This it is history the way of using colors form unbeliveble,this museam have to be seen and you will apreciate even more the Mexican Art",
          "This is a nice museum in an elegant old mansion. The house is worth seeing all by itself. Great temporary exhibition on pottery and one of the best bookstores in Merida for art/Mayan/history/culture.",
          "This museum no longer is the anthropology museum. All its artifacts have been transferred to the new Museo Mundo Maya, but it is still a museum, so the city is better off, as are its cab drivers as the MMM is not in the city center.",
          "This museum is by far one of the best I have been to! If you want to see and learn about the Mya or Aztec and how it all ties together with Mexico, this is the place to go. So many great artifacts to see and explore! It may take you two days to see it all, but I suggest to do",
          "Right now the museum is under renovation, but there are still very interesting things to see. The architecture alone is amazing. The photos and lore upstairs are interesting and worth your time and attention. I was with a friend who speaks Mayan, Spanish and English and so",
          "I was intrigued by the splendor of this former home, now a museum. The 1st floor photos (taken several decades ago) were interesting, especially since I've been to most of the archeological sites. However, it was the 2nd floor exhibit that really grabbed my attention. I was",
          "When we were there (May 2014) they had a fantastic photo exhibit on the second floor detailing modern day Mayan village life and mythology! The text of the exhibit was in Yucatec Maya, Spanish and English. We were so glad we went upstairs! I hope they keep this one for a long",
          "I certainly would not go out of my way to see this. On our visit, they had a plywood walk through exhibit about Mayan culture, but could not get past the feeling they were desperately trying to fill space. The house is nice, but not all that interesting.",
          "Worth visiting just for the architecture of this mansion on the stylish Paseo Montejo. Apparently many of the exhibits have now migrated to the new slightly out of town Gran Museo del Mundo Maya which makes the displays here feel somewhat contrived. Nevertheless worth a short",
          "A great museum on the Paseo Montejo within a beautiful old palace/mansion. Limited size but interesting and educational content. We much preferred this museum to the more distant, way more expensive Gran Museo del Mundo Maya. Walkable from the Gran Plaza. Nice local",
          "This museum used to be one of our favourites to visit as it was pacted with hundreds of extremely interesting pieces and had an upstairs devoted to many unique and focused special exhibits. Recent changes in the past few months seem to have stripped the museum of almost its",
          "The architecture is stunning, the finishes are to die for, the floating staircase is like something out of the movies. Self help quides next to each exhibit were helpful although the text was a little small for someone challenged by type size...",
          "The mansion on Paseo Montejo, the Palacio Canton, is an architectural gem of a past century. The building alone is worth the addmission fee but the changing exhibits are always informative and educational. They are not in depth, but give you a brief introduction to the",
          "This was our second time to visit the museum in less than a year. The new exhibits were well worth seeing. Not only is the building beautifully kept, but the displays are well placed and well lighted. They have amazing photos of various parts of the Yucatan and some of the most",
          "A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words, and a Good Imagination is Invaluable... as there are no english signs. And still this Small Museaum is Mighty. The artifacts are truly Awesome especially if you delight in seeing life in a totally different era. Located on the corner of Calle",
          "Entrance fee is minimal, but it is worth to go through the museum to see the interior of this once amazing home. The Museum depicts life in the Mayan culture and separates it by their daily living activities. ie. work, play, food, family, etc. All definitions are in Spanish",
          "Despite how it looks on the outside, this is a small museum. The first floor has a number of Mayan artifacts. This was an actual residence and pictures of people who lived in it are on the second floor. Worth the modest price of admission.",
          "We enjoyed visiting this museum, but be aware that it is a limited collection and the ground floor, which has most of the exhibits, does not have any signs in any language other than Spanish. There is not even a guide available in English, so we felt that we probably missed a",
          "This museum is beautiful inside and out, it's located in what looks like an old mansion on the Paseo De Montejo, and the collection that was on view was exquisite. The description tags were in Spanish only, but hey! It's a Spanish speaking country! The staff in the very nice",
          "Well worth an afternoon trip. Very informative. A good introduction to Mayan culture and history. Wish there were more signs in English, and perhaps a self-guide a recorded tour in English. Since people come to this museum from all over the world, self-guided recorded tours in",
          "Started at the foot of Paseo de Montejo, stopped in this museum---very nice, quiet place---continued on to Hennesey's. Both worth a visit.",
          "This was a mansion built early last century that has been converted into a museum. All of the signs are in Spanish--so be prepared for that. I think it took us a little over an hour to explore the entire museum and to make a stop in the store to make a purchase. Even if you",
          "Great maps and photos commemorating the building of this building on Paseo de Montejo. The architecture is lovely as are the adornings and attention to detail inside too. Many of the Mayan artifacts got moved to Museo del Mundo Maya due to this building being too small to house",
          "This is a small galley with some very interesting exhibits, there is a small fee to enter, I particularly enjoyed the sculptures.",
          "It's a nice area for a walk and an intriguing building to see, but the museum has none of the mayan artifacts any more - so don't bother spending the money to go in.",
          "While cruising Paseo Montejo a stop at the Anthropology and History Museum is a must. It's small, but very interesting, and a good way to start building appreciation for Mayan art.",
          "Well organized with wonderful preservation of artifacts. Quiet, and a very good location for understanding the history of the wonderful area.",
          "Big empty expensive shell. The old one was nicer and was there. What a waste of taxpayer money. The old building has some exhibits, worth seeing the old building",
          "The whole tour of the Museum was awesome unbelievable history, having a knowledgeable guide, namely Agustin, everything was explained perfectly.",
          "The whole tour of the Museum was awesome unbelievable history, having a knowledgeable guide, namely Roberto, everything was explained perfectly.",
          "Some brief history of the Canton family - otherwise a showcase for regional huipils of Yucatan. Housed in former Canton \"palace\" which gives a feel for the wealth of the hacendados.",
          "For those of you who have visited before OR who are using guide books, visitors need to be aware that the contents of the museum has changed radically with the opening of the NEW Museo del Mundo Maya just this past December, 2012. The museum is still worth a visit to, not only",
          "There is very little precolonial history or material at this museum now. Apparently the new Gran Museo del Mundo Maya farther up the avenue is the place to go to learn about Maya history and anthropology. That is an excellent museum (look for review under that heading). This",
          "We were quite disappointed to find that there were only two small cases with Mayan artifacts. The museum currently has an exhibit on the building's history, some photos documenting late 1800's exploration of Mayan ruins, a few portraits, and a very large exhibit on embroidered",
          "Superb architecture but that alone isn't worth the entrance fee as there is basically no museum left - all the exhibits have been moved to the new Mayan museum further out of town. Nice gift shop though.",
          "Unless you are going to see a refurbished old home, the museum itself is not worth the look. The effort was there, but little material and actual history.",
          "There used to be the best anthropology museum here, but since Grand Museo Maya opened up, this museum is hosting a Mayan Dress- huipile, exhibit. It is charming, but I wish the old exhibits were still housed here. They were so interesting.",
          "What a beautiful museum! Although small, it was so diverse in it's offerings. Offered a wonderful look at Merida in the past, and had a beautiful exhibit upstairs of local textiles when I visited in January. Admission was nominal and the gift shop/book store was terrific!",
          "We arrived at 4:15 and they close at 5pm. We were rushed by the staff because apparently they like to lock up at 4:30. The most interesting part was a photography exhibit on the Mayan ruins. This was most interesting having visited many of the locations portrayed, since we",
          "Housed in a beautiful colonial building. There are many beautiful Mayan artifacts to see. Exhibits are very tastefully displayed.",
          "we didnt expect to find this charming little museum, an oldie itself, but very interesting if you have the time to live it !",
          "The museum is housed in a magnificent colonial mansion. When we were there, it had a display of huipils, a history of the family that built the mansion and a few token Mayan relics. This is no longer a museum of anthropology. The building itself is impressive.",
          "This is the place to find out the details of the Mayan civilization. The guides are knowledgable and courteous and very cheap",
          "Nice easy to visit site. The relics are interesting and give a good overall history of the Yucatan people",
          "The magnifient archictecture from the outside is fabulous but it is not open right now as they have moved everything to the new Gran Museo.",
          "This museum is located in the beautiful Palacio Canton (which unfortunately has its own listing on TripAdvisor). It recently re-opened in December 2012. The museum had a few exhibits on the history of the Palacio Canton, an exhibit on various archaeological trips organized by",
          "We expected a lot more than several photos--albeit interesting photos--and a few artifacts. The home itself is breathtaking, but as far as museums go, this was definitely a disappointment.",
          "If you are expecting to learn about the Mayans, this is not the place to go. It is a bit out of the center of town and is a colonial house converted into a museum. There are weaving exhibitions and family photos of the former owners, but just a few photos of the owners",
          "This beautifully restored mansion on Montejo Ave. is simply a wonderful facility. The architecture and finishes are truly something to enjoy. The craftsmanship is exemplary and with the artifacts and descriptive narratives it provides an informative journey through the past. It",
          "The museum is scheduled to reopen Dec. 21, 2012. The requirement for 100 letters is not helpful. Useful updates are discouraged.",
          "If you're in Merida, take a couple a couple of hours and enjoy the Mayan ruins at Dzibilchaltun. Located about 20 kms north of Merida on the highway between Medida and Progreso, this anthropological site contains some small but defined Mayan ruins, some Spanish colonial ruins",
          "It was closed for renovations but we only found out after we had walked out to it. Some interesting buildings to see on the way though but didn't really justify the walk.",
          "Don't know what's going on with this building, but a sign at the entrance gate told us it was closed for renovation. Check status before you visit.",
          "This museum is located in a very large historic mansion. Very Beautiful. Lots of Mayan history. A must see for the history buff",
          "The Anthropology Museum should be your first stop in Merida, if you are planning on visiting Mayan ruins nearby. There are excellent guides who will give you a good grounding in the history and development of Mayan culture and spirituality. Every time I go I learn something",
          "This beautiful attraction is now closed and the exhibits moved to the Maya Museum north of the city. I've heard rumors that it will be furnished with period pieces as a home and reopened to the public but no date has been given. Still, enjoy the view from Paseo de Montejo, as",
          "The exhibits are housed in a beautiful building. Although the quantity of artifacts are relatively small they are well displayed. It is definitely worth a look",
          "This museum was great! It takes you through a nice little tour of the artifacts of various Mayan ruins from the area on the first floor. Then on the second floor it shows you about the Montejo family and the colonial era. When we came to the museum they had explanations of",
          "After seeing Chichen Itza, I often wondered about how wonderful it would be to see the actual objects found in the sacred cenote. I visited the Peabody Museum at Harvard University and was not impressed. ( Many were off display) While in Merida I was elated to see the many",
          "Like any museum, it's best to get there early. Our entrance was mid-day and slightly more crowded than I would have liked. The exhibits are wonderful if you want to read quite a bit. If reading isn't your thing, ask for a tour guide, the people there are very nice.",
          "I really liked that there was an entire floor dedicated to the history of the Montejo family and the mansion itself.",
          "The Anthropology and History Museum of Merida is a wonder into itself. This old mansion has been referbished to a luster not seen, in all probability, its entire history. The Mayan exibits give you an indepth view into the culture, language and majesty of this exceptional",
          "Great collection and amazing architecture. Nice neighborhood too.",
          "Spent a good hour here today, very interesting however most of the signs in Spanish only so a little hard to follow. Gret little museum recommended by a fellow guest at our hotel who is studying the Mayans for the next month",
          "It is a beautiful small museum located in a magnificent building. I have been there many times. As a first time visitor, I recommend a guide. They are excellent",
          "especially on sunday when its FREE! great info on the Maya...take a guided tour its worth the extra.",
          "If you want some history and to see some fine examples at what is at the Mayan ruins this is a must. We did this after seeing Uxmal and where happy we did.",

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida, officially known as Santiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida, is the capital of the municipality of Libertador and the state of M\u00e9rida, and is one of the main cities of the Venezuelan Andes. It was founded in 1558 by Captain Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez, forming part of Nueva Granada, but later became part of the Captaincy General of Venezuela and played an active role in the War of Independence.\nThe capital city's population is 204,879 inhabitants, and the metropolitan area, that includes the municipality of Libertador, reaches 345,489 people (Census 2001). The city accounts for 28% of the total population of M\u00e9rida State, which has more than 750,000 inhabitants (Census 2001). It is home to the University of Los Andes and the Archdiocese of M\u00e9rida. It also has the highest and longest cable car in the world. It is the largest student and tourist center of western Venezuela. The mass transit system (Troleb\u00fas M\u00e9rida) is available as a means of tourist transport.\nThis city sits on a plateau nestled in the valley of the Chama River, which runs from end to end. The town of M\u00e9rida is located at an altitude of 1,600 metres (5,200 feet). As background on the horizon rises the country's highest summit: the Pico Bol\u00edvar with an altitude of 4,981 metres (16,342 feet).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nM\u00e9rida was founded by Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez on October 9, 1558 in one of the Pamplonian mining expeditions he led. The first settlement of M\u00e9rida was not the current one but 30 kilometres (19 miles) to the south, in Xam\u00fa, where today stands Lagunillas. Nevertheless, in November 1559, Juan de Maldonado moved the settlement to nearby El Punto (presently the Zumba area), because of constant confrontations with the native neighbours.Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez's foundation had not been authorized by the New Granadian Authorities, so in 1560 they sent Juan de Maldonado to arrest Juan Rodr\u00edguez and regularize the new city. On June 24 Maldonado moved M\u00e9rida to its present location on the plateau and rechristened it as Santiago de los Caballeros. The city then came to be governed by the corregimiento of Tunja until 1607, when it became itself a corregimiento of the Audiencia of Santa Fe.In 1622, M\u00e9rida became the capital of the Governorate of M\u00e9rida, whose chief official established his residence there. The city and territory were part of New Granada until 1777, when it was integrated into the Captaincy of Venezuela.\nThe city was elevated to the status of an episcopal see in 1785. This led to the creation of a seminary, which in 1811 became the University of the Andes.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe city was named after the founder Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez, who called so in honor of his hometown of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.\nHowever, Juan de Maldonado renamed it as San Juan de las Nieves. In 1559 the name changed again, opting this time for Santiago de los Caballeros. Gradually, it was adopting the name of Santiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida, combining the variants that had been appointed to the city until then.\nThe word M\u00e9rida comes from the Latin \"em\u00e9rita\", from Emeritus, one who has merit, which also references to veteran Roman soldiers who were discharged from the army after completion of their mandatory service commitment. Another feature common to both the Spanish and the Venezuelan M\u00e9ridas is that in both cities, there is a tributary of the main river with the name Albarregas.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n \n\nThe city is located in the center of the Venezuelan Andes, in a wide plain in the valley of the Chama River, between the Sierra Nevada de M\u00e9rida to the southeast and the Sierra La Culata to the northwest. The old quarter of the city is on the alluvial plain known as Tatuy.\nM\u00e9rida has four principal rivers and some smaller seasonal streams in the less urbanized parts of the city, these last ones have a significant water flow only in times of heavy precipitation. The most important river is the Chama, followed by the Albarregas, which cross the plain and divide it into two parts: the Banda Occidental (west bank) and the Banda Oriental (east bank). These two rivers run from one end of the city to the other. The other two principal rivers are the Mucuj\u00fan and the Milla, which flow into the Chama and Albarregas. In the lower part of the city is found the La Rosa lake, one of some 200 lakes in M\u00e9rida State.\nIn the center of the city the terrain, located on a plain, is almost flat. Nonetheless, there is an average incline of 3 to 7 degrees, which causes a difference in altitude between the high and low parts of the city of more than 400 m (1,300 ft), the average being 1,630 m (5,350 ft) above sea level at the Plaza Bol\u00edvar. However, the areas surrounding the city are rough and uneven, situated in the valleys formed by the Chama and Albarregas rivers and the Sierra Nevada and Sierra de La Culata ranges.\nThe valley in which the city is located was formed approximately 40 to 60 million years ago with the creation of the Venezuelan Andes and its continuous erosion by the area's water systems. Its soils consist of alluvial sediment and clay. Below the city runs the major tectonic fault in the western part of the country, the Bocon\u00f3 fault, which forms part of the South American Plate.\nThe vegetation in the interior of the city consists of medium to tall trees, and ferns (Pteridophyte), located mainly near the basin of the Albarregas river. On the outskirts of M\u00e9rida, one finds non-urbanized areas, where sub-mountainous and seasonal jungle vegetation predominates. On the other hand, vast coniferous forests extend toward the south, where they were planted some years ago. Toward the north and east, one finds cloud forests.\nSignificant among the local fauna are important populations of certain small and medium-sized birds such as hummingbirds and parrots (Psittacidae), spread particularly to the south of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nM\u00e9rida lies between a tropical monsoon climate (Am), bordering on a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cwb), with cooler temperatures than other cities in Venezuela, with dry winters.  Though the emission greenhouse gases has caused a rise in temperatures, this has been less, in relative terms, than in other important cities in Venezuela, with readings that vary between 19 \u00b0C and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), with an overall average of 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F). Precipitation is heavy during the rainy season, from April to November, though the city does receive more sunshine than most cities in the Colombian Andes, since the valley is too narrow for fog to accumulate.\nVenezuela is situated in an inter-tropical zone, so that there is very little temperature variance over the course of a year. The same is true in M\u00e9rida\u2014the temperatures recorded in August are normally comparable to those measured under comparable conditions in broad daylight in January.\nOn the other hand, given M\u00e9rida's location in the interior of the country, far from the maritime coasts and the influence of the ocean, and its high altitude, the temperature variance over the course of a day is relatively high. Between day and night a difference of more than 10 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F) can be observed; this difference sometimes reaches more than 20 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F). The maximums are reached during the day, and are usually around 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), but on rare occasions exceed 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). The lower limit of daytime temperatures tends to be around 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Government ==\nM\u00e9rida is the seat of the state and municipal governments, and is also home to the Governor and the Mayor's offices, the state legislature, and the regional offices of the judicial and electoral branches. Important representatives and governors are also taken to this city to meet at an annual voting session. Moreover, 13 of the 15 prefectures of the Libertador Municipality are located within the city.\nNowadays, politics have an important role among the general population, although to a lesser extent than in the larger urban centers, and the most important government positions, including Mayor and Governor, are held by members of the official party, the Fifth Republic Movement.  Because of the great concentration of students, and the importance of the Universidad de Los Andes in local development, the positions of University Director and President of the Student Body of the University of The Andes are also of great importance within the local political scene; the first of these offices is currently filled by an opposition party member. Due to the recent suspension of the elections for President of the University Student Body, the city has seen an intense wave of protests that have left more than a dozen wounded.\nIn the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum, the city of M\u00e9rida voted against the overall trend, as at least 60% of voters opposed the continuation of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's mandate. By contrast, the majority of the rest of the population of the state of M\u00e9rida voted in favor of Ch\u00e1vez.\n\n\n=== City planning ===\n\nBecause of its location on a plateau, in a small valley, covering an area of some 10 to 15 km (6 to 9 mi) in length and between 1 and 3 km (2 mi) wide, the city now lacks additional space for urban development. Though its polygonal area covers some 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi), the city occupies a little over 25 square kilometres (10 sq mi), and the rest consists of less developed zones or areas of uneven terrain, such as mountains or hillsides.\nFor this reason, the city layout is unorganized, oriented only by the traffic axes constructed in decades past. The layout of the city center or \"Old Quarter\" is in the Spanish Colonial style, consisting of eight major avenues running east\u2013west and forty streets running north\u2013south, creating blocks of 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330 feet) per side.\nHistorically, M\u00e9rida has been characterized by less pronounced differences between socio-economic classes and for its high quality of life.  Recent years, however, owing to the economic situation confronting the country, have seen a significant increase in slums in the hills and outskirts of the city.\nThe southeastern part of the city, historically the headquarters of the large Haciendas that produced sugar cane, has for several decades undergone major urban development, consisting principally of single-family dwellings, and has grown almost to the point of joining with the city of Ejido, a bedroom community. Ejido currently extends to within less than 2 km (1 mi) of the border of M\u00e9rida, and the two cities are linked by a large avenue that goes from the neighborhoods of downtown M\u00e9rida to the outskirts of Ejido. At this point, it turns into a highway, running to the city of El Vig\u00eda, thereby uniting M\u00e9rida's metropolitan area.\nDespite the limited space available for development, M\u00e9rida has the largest proportion of green areas per capita in Venezuela, thanks to its many squares and public parks, the one surrounding the river Albarregas being particularly noteworthy. The School of Architecture of the University of the Andes puts into practice diverse proposals for creating areas protected from urban development, thereby reducing the impact of population growth on the environment.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nThere were only two neighborhoods in the city at the beginning of the 20th century. One of them was Casco Central (central quarter), located in the east bank of the plateau; which in turn was divided in various zones, identified according to the name of the local square within. The other neighborhood of the city was by the other side of the Albarregas river, in the west bank. It was known as La Otra Banda (\"the other bank\"). However, as a result of the Oil Boom, immigration and various other reasons, new neighborhoods appeared as years went by. The first to emerge were those near downtown. Then, due to the lack of real estate and in the search of quieter areas, neighborhoods were created far, at the time, from the city center. Some of these old spurs have now become part of the city. The following are the main neighborhoods of the city.\n\nBelensate\nPredominantly a higher-class neighborhood, it contains the largest and most luxurious houses in the city.\nCasco Central\nIt comprises the historic city center. It is the main commercial, cultural, and urban area, containing most  museums, libraries, churches, and retail shopping stores in M\u00e9rida.\nChama\nIt is a residential area for the middle class located in the vicinity of the Chama river. It is the lowest-altitude neighborhood in the city, situated about 200 metres (660 feet) lower than downtown. It will be connected to Casco Central via an aerial cableway planned as part of the M\u00e9rida trolleybus project.\nHumboldt\nIt is a populated neighborhood to the southwest of the city, with increasing commercial development in recent years.\nLa Hechicera\nLocated at the northern end of the city, it contains the scientific and engineering buildings of the ULA, as well as the zoo and the botanical garden.\nLa Parroquia\nThis is the current name of the village formerly known as La Punta. It shares similarities with the Casco Central, with residential and commercial zones intermingled. It contains the second Bol\u00edvar Square in the city, as well as large public high schools and sporting facilities, such as the Metropolitan Stadium and the sport complex Cinco \u00c1guilas Blancas.\nLa Pedregosa\nIt is a long neighborhood located in the valley of La Pedregosa creek. It is mainly a residential zone. Although connected to the city, it is far enough from it that its development has increased in the last decades due to the availability of suitable real estate.\nLos Curos\nThis is a popular neighborhood, almost exclusively residential, though it houses one of the few industrial zones in the city.\nPie del Llano\nSituated in the middle of the city, it surrounds the airport and local branches of a number of government offices, as well as the city Mayor's office. It is a commercial and residential neighborhood with plenty of public parks.\nAvenida 16/Campo de Oro/Santa Juana\nIt is a middle-class neighborhood located in the geographical center of the city. It borders the Tatuy mesa, which houses a number of car dealers and auto shops and, above all, the largest hospital of the city, the IHULA (Instituto Aut\u00f3nomo Hospital Universitario de los Andes)Finally, the municipality is divided (for political purposes) into parishes; thirteen of the municipality's fifteen parishes are within the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDespite being one of the largest cities in the Venezuelan Andes, M\u00e9rida has traditionally been less populated in comparison to other more rapidly growing cities in the country. At the beginning of the 19th century, the city only had about 5,000 inhabitants. The demographic growth saw no major changes until the last three decades of the 20th century, when the population tripled, from 74,000 (according to the 1971 census) to the current estimate of 214,000. The increase in number of inhabitants was mainly due to a recent exodus of farmers moving to the urban centers, a phenomenon seen all over the country. Moreover, the prestige of the University of the Andes transformed M\u00e9rida in one of the leading educational centers nationwide. As a result, the city houses an important student population from all over the country.\nAccording to the last census, performed in 2001, M\u00e9rida's population was of 204,879 inhabitants. This value does not include the population omitted by the survey, which was estimated to be about 6% nationwide. However, M\u00e9rida's metropolitan (greater) area, which includes the neighboring cities of Tabay and Ejido, houses over 300,000 inhabitants.\nIn 2006, assuming the usual natural level of growth in the area (between 2.1% and 3% annually), the population reached 230,000 inhabitants, while the metropolitan area would have reached 350,000, thanks to the high growth rate in the city of Ejido, which is one of the largest of the Andes area.\nOther estimates indicate that the actual population of the city has now reached about 250,000 inhabitants and that the metropolitan area has 350,000 inhabitants.\nThe population of M\u00e9rida is relatively homogeneous. There is, however, a large community of foreigners, resulting from the inter- and intra-continental migratory patterns of past eras. Among these there are significant groups of Italians, Portuguese, and Colombians. According to the 1990 census, a little over 4% of the population\u2013some 7,406 inhabitants\u2013is of foreign origin.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city enjoys the highest quality of life in Venezuela. In the year 2000, thirty-six health centers were located in the metropolitan area of M\u00e9rida, as follows: one type I hospital, one type III hospital, and one type IV hospital, in the city proper, plus 15 urban clinics, four of type III and 11 of type I. The area also has 18 rural clinics, 13 of type II and 5 of type I.\nAs in other respects, the Universidad de Los Andes and its buildings are closely tied to the city; the health care infrastructure consists largely of medical centers belonging to the former, in addition to private health centers. Notable among the public hospitals that offer free services is the Instituto Aut\u00f3nomo Hospital Universitario de Los Andes (IHULA), the largest in the region, as well as two smaller hospitals and a chapter of the Venezuelan Red Cross. The larger private hospitals (commonly referred to as \"clinics\") are the Clinical Hospital of M\u00e9rida, the Clinical Center, the M\u00e9rida Clinic, and the Albarregas Clinic. There are also another dozen smaller clinics.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of M\u00e9rida has one of the lowest poverty indexes in Venezuela. According to the 2001 census, 18.09% of the population lives in poverty; this figure is beaten only by San Crist\u00f3bal (17.05%) and the municipalities of Chacao (8.69%), Baruta (11.22%) and San Antonio de Los Altos (6.13%) in the state of Miranda.The city's economy has been evolving and transforming since the beginning of the 20th century. Traditionally, agriculture formed the most significant part of economic activity in M\u00e9rida, which was the distribution center for agricultural goods in the state. Furthermore, large sugar cane haciendas were located nearby; their income led to the construction of a central sugar refinery in which all of M\u00e9rida's sugar cane was processed. This refinery was eventually abandoned and has now been converted into a museum. With the construction of M\u00e9rida Cable Car, the trans-Andes highway, and the city's airport, the city's economy evolved, with the tertiary services sector\u2014especially tourism\u2014displacing the primary agricultural sector.\nTourism, dubbed the \"green industry\", is the principal source of income in the city, and one of the most flourishing industries. Touristic activity benefits from the potential offered by the Andes mountains surrounding the city, and from the city's own parks, museums, and plazas, among other features. In addition, in recent years, owing to the creation of the only free cultural, scientific, and technological zone in the country, the city has begun to develop in the field of technology, thanks also to the support of the university in this matter.\nThe city of M\u00e9rida now stands out at the national level for its low cost of living and its high (relative to cost of living) per capita income of $4,381, ninth among Venezuelan cities. The service sector contributes a large percentage of the state's income. In M\u00e9rida 82,537 people are economically active, of whom 6.67% are unemployed.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nDuring the colonial era and long after independence, the city was isolated from other parts of the country because of the lack of transportation routes to the outside world. Midway through the 19th century, the first highway was built, linking the city with the rest of the country, thereby facilitating access and vehicular traffic. After this point other routes were planned, but lack of maintenance and the nature of the terrain have caused significant interruptions in land traffic between M\u00e9rida and the rest of the country.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nThe city had one national airport, Alberto Carnevalli Airport, which is embedded in the center of the city, and once offered connections to the principal cities of the western Venezuela, such as Maracaibo and Caracas. Furthermore, this airport was one of the most active in the country, with more than 20 daily flights to and from Caracas alone. The airport was closed down however in 2009 due to the many accidents that occurred because of its difficult position within the Andes. As of 2015, Avior Airlines offers flights to Caracas. Other nearby airports, such as Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonso International Airport in El Vig\u00eda, now serve M\u00e9rida.\nThe airport was built in 1956, on the former grounds of a slaughterhouse. Commercial air service was provided by two airlines. There is also an area for private aviation, which receives various types of private flights as well as air ambulance flights, and the delivery of parcels and other valuables.\n\n\n=== Road network ===\nM\u00e9rida has four large internal roadways, which run from one end of the city to the other, and five smaller roadways. The largest is the combination of the Andr\u00e9s Bello and Urdaneta avenues. With a length of more than 8 km (5 mi), it runs from the neighborhoods of the central quarter of M\u00e9rida to the outskirts of Ejido. The other three correspond to Las Am\u00e9ricas and Alberto Carnevali avenues; 16 de septiembre and Tulio Febres Cordero avenues; and the corridor of Los Pr\u00f3ceres avenue.\nTwo national highways connect M\u00e9rida with other cities in Venezuela. The first is Troncal 7 or the Trans-Andes Highway, which runs to the city of Valera. This highway crosses the Andes by way of the valley of the Chama River, and, arriving at the region of Apartaderos, is crossed by Local 1. Finally, following the course of the Santo Domingo River, it arrives at the city of Barinas. The other national highway is the so-called Carretera La Variante. Upon arriving at the Estanques region it becomes Local 8 or Autopista Rafael Caldera. La Variante connects M\u00e9rida with El Vig\u00eda, and in turn, with the Pan-American Highway, thereby giving the city a connection with Colombia and with other important destinations, such as San Crist\u00f3bal and Maracaibo.\nIn addition to the national highways, three alternative routes exit the city of M\u00e9rida. The first, called the V\u00eda del Valle (Valley Road) links the city with the north, to various communities in the valley of the Culata, in the municipality of Santos Marquina. The second is an alternative route to the city of Ejido and other communities such as Jaj\u00ed and La Azulita; it is also a tourism route, with various lookout points facing M\u00e9rida in its initial section. A third minor route, used exclusively by rural vehicles, connects the city with the community of Los Nevados and with the Sierra Nevada National Park.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nAlong with a trolleybus rapid-transit system (still under construction and not fully open), the city relies on a vast system of urban and interurban bus routes which connect the city with its metropolitan area. The conventional bus routes traverse the various avenues of the city and cover a large percentage of the city's area. M\u00e9rida has one of Venezuela's best public transit systems; nevertheless, the system has become overwhelmed by increasing demand, and may be beginning to collapse. Among the existing routes, the route from the center of the city of Ejido to the center of the city of M\u00e9rida stands out, with a volume of thousands of passengers daily.\nThe bus routes are serviced by private companies, the majority of which are cooperatives or driver's associations, following the private model practiced in most of the cities in Venezuela. However, the prices charged are regulated by the city and supervised by the municipal organization for metropolitan transport. As is the practice throughout the country, the public transport system has special fares for senior citizens, and a student pass providing some of the lowest costs in the country.\nAfter years of study, the construction of a non-polluting mass transit system was proposed; the trolleybus was chosen as the most appropriate means of transport. Construction of the M\u00e9rida trolleybus system started near the end of the 1990s. The first line was inaugurated on June 18, 2007, with 15 of 34 proposed stations completed. This route serves Ejido and M\u00e9rida. The second line is in the planning stages and is expected to be 12 km (7 mi) long with 3 common stations alongside or crossing route 1. Route 3, an aerial cableway (originally planned to be a funicular), is a  3 km (2 mi) long route that will connect the community of Chama to a M\u00e9rida trolleybus station; construction has yet to begin. Once construction is completed, M\u00e9rida will be the first city in Latin America with under 500,000 inhabitants to have a rapid-transit system. The existing bus lines will be reorganized into 47 or so feeder routes, in order to provide better public transit to less-serviced areas.\n\n\n=== Regional transport ===\nThe only regional public transit available in M\u00e9rida is by bus. These depart from the city bus station. In addition, there are other private terminals from which private lines depart. From the central station one can take buses to destinations within the state, the region, and the rest of the country. Some of the most heavily used routes in the country start from this station, in particular, those that link M\u00e9rida with the city of Caracas. Though Venezuela is undertaking the construction of a national railway system, the IAFE, in order to link together the country, the city of M\u00e9rida is not projected to be a stop on this system: the nearest stop will be the city of El Vig\u00eda, some 60 km (37 mi) away.\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\nM\u00e9rida contains numerous historical squares, colonial houses, churches, and government buildings that make up most of its sightseeing spots. Moreover, the educational development of the city due, for the most part, to its university (ULA) has contributed to the creation of museums, libraries, and centers for scientific research, such as the Center for Astronomy Research (CIDA), located a few kilometers from the city in the mountains near Apartaderos.\n\n\n=== Monuments, public buildings, and historic places ===\nHouse of Former Governors\nThis colonial-style villa, located in the central quarter, was the official residence of the state governors.\nRectorate's Building\nSeat of the university's rectorate and Aula Magna.\nGovernment Palace\nThe government building, regional executive branch.\nPlaza Monumental Rom\u00e1n Eduardo Sandia\nThe Bullfighting Arena of M\u00e9rida was built in 1967. It has a capacity of 16,000 people and it is frequently used for cultural activities, besides serving its original purpose of bullfighting arena during the Sun Fairs.\nCable Car\nThe M\u00e9rida Cable Car is one of the main touristic spots. In its trajectory, it ascends from the central quarter to the Sierra Nevada. Currently, it holds two world records: one for being the longest cable car system in the world (12.5 km or 7.8 mi) and another one for being the highest cable car system in the world (4,367 m or 14,327 ft). The cable car was completed in 1958. It was closed in 2008 for construction of a new cable car system. It was reopened in April 2016.\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nM\u00e9rida has about two dozen religious buildings dedicated to Christianity, the most important of which are Catholic churches and chapels, since it is the religion with most number of followers in Venezuela.\n\nCathedral of M\u00e9rida\nThe city's Minor Basilica, built in Baroque style, similar to the Cathedral of Toledo, Spain. It is the main Catholic building in the city, where the Archbishop of M\u00e9rida presides the mass services.\nIglesia del Carmen\nThe oldest religious structure in M\u00e9rida, Our Lady of Carmen Church stands close to the Plaza Bol\u00edvar. Visitors marvel at its colonial architecture and its historical significance \u2013 the church is a seat of the Carmelite Brotherhood. It served as cathedral of the city between 1812 and 1866, before the current one was built.\nIglesia de la Tercera\nIglesia del Llano\nM\u00e9rida's only building in the Gothic style. It stands near the place where an old chapel held the first wooden cross brought to M\u00e9rida by the Spaniards.\nIglesia de Milla\nThis is one of the oldest churches in the city, originally built in the 18th century and rebuilt in 1907 after an earthquake. It is located in front of the square with the same name.\nArchbishop's Palace\nA Baroque palace located in front of Bol\u00edvar Square. It has served as the residence for the Archbishop since 1951. It houses the Archdiocesan Museum.\n\n\n=== Parks, squares, and sightseeing ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is famous nationwide for its great number of parks and squares, providing its inhabitants with access to nature. There are, at least, a dozen squares and two dozen parks, some of which are described below.\n\nBoulevard de los Pintores (Painters' Boulevard)\nOn this street painters congregate in order to create, exhibit, and sell their works.\nAquarium Garden\nThis aquarium exhibits both fresh and salt water fish. It also has collections relating to M\u00e9rida's rural past.\nBeethoven Park\nLocated in front of the Museum of Modern Art in the northern area of the city, this pretty park has a clock on the ground, whose numbers are flowerpots, and large mechanical carillon clock with wooden elves that play melodies from the famous German composer.\nM\u00e9rida Botanical Garden\nThis was the first botanical garden in the city. It is located in the extreme north of the city and has about 40 hectares under cultivation.\nParque Domingo Pe\u00f1a\nAlso called Paseo de la Feria or Parque de los Conquistadores, consists of an avenue with a lookout point facing the Sierra Nevada. Student celebrations and get-togethers often take place here.\nParque Metropolitano Albarregas\nThis park is the largest in the city, 22 km (14 mi) long and 612 hectares in area. It is located on the bank of the Albarregas River, and contains play areas for children and a sculpture museum.\nParque Ciudad de los Ni\u00f1os (Children's City Park)\nA large children's park, which models the shape of the city on a smaller scale.\nParque de las Cinco Rep\u00fablicas (Park of the Five Republics)\nA park that is the home of the Bol\u00edvar Column, a monument dedicated to Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. This was the first sculpture constructed to honor Bol\u00edvar, in 1842. It was commissioned by the then-governor of the province, Gabriel Pic\u00f3n. It was erected to commemorate the moving of Bol\u00edvar's remains to the Pante\u00f3n Nacional in Caracas, from their previous resting place in the city of Santa Marta, Colombia, where Bol\u00edvar had been buried following his death in 1830. The monument consists of a pillar on which sits Bol\u00edvar's face in bronze.\nParque del Ej\u00e9rcito (Park of the Army)\nA small park, located in the south of the city, commemorating Venezuela's army. It has green areas, a fountain, and models of military tanks.\nParque La Isla (Island Park)\nSituated in the former location of a coffee plantation of the same name, the park was built in 1960 partly as an underwater park, and is 3.5 hectares in area. Its infrastructure is reminiscent to that of an island, offering kids play grounds, trails, and athletic courts. The park houses the largest convention center in the city, as well as the headquarters of Corpoandes (a government-run corporation that promotes development in the Andes region), facilities for cultivating orchids, and a museum dedicated to beekeeping.\nParque Las tres M\u00e9ridas (Three M\u00e9ridas Park)\nA small park that commemorates the three cities in the world named M\u00e9rida (in Spain, Mexico, and Venezuela). It features architectural elements typical of each city.\nParque Zool\u00f3gico los Chorros de Milla\nA small zoo situated in the extreme north of the city where the Milla waterfalls once flowed, it contains species indigenous to Venezuela and the Andes region.\nParque la Marina (Park of the Navy)\nLocated in Belensate, it has a large water pool surrounding a submarine fin, an underwater clock, and a children's play area in the shape of a boat.\nParque Tibisay\nThis park is dedicated to Tibisay, princess of the original dwellers of the region, the tribe Mucuj\u00fan.  According to legend, she still laments the death of her fianc\u00e9 Chief Murach\u00ed, who died bravely fighting the Spanish conquistadors. This park is located at the north end of Urdaneta avenue.\nPlaza Bel\u00e9n\nA small plaza, located to the northeast of the city center, in a neighbourhood of the same name. Its design, like that of most of the other plazas described here, follows the prototypical Spanish colonial style.\nPlaza Bol\u00edvar\nThe past and present main square of M\u00e9rida, it is surrounded by the most important public and historical buildings of the city. It has an equestrian statue of Bolivar.\nPlaza Glorias Patrias\nConsists of twin plazas constructed in honor of the independence leaders Vicente Campo El\u00edas and Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez.\nPlaza Las Hero\u00ednas (Plaza of the Heroines)\nA plaza constructed to honor five women from M\u00e9rida who fought for independence. It is surrounded by various markets and artisans shops, and the first Cable Car station.\nPlaza de Milla\nThe actual name of this square is Plaza Sucre. It is located in front the Iglesia de Milla and near the army headquarters, northeast of the city center. It is dedicated to the independence hero Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, and it is frequently visited by locals and tourists alike, due to its convenient location among hotels, pensions, restaurants, stores, and ice cream parlors.\n\n\n== Gallery Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is a student city with a large percentage of its population found in classrooms, especially in the university area, where 20\u201330% of the population consists of students, and has a 0% illiteracy rate. It is the home of the University of the Andes, one of the most respected universities in the country, and the second to oldest. M\u00e9rida also contains various institutions of higher educations such as universities, university centers, polytechnic institutes, and university colleges, among others.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nThe University of the Andes, the most important in the city, was established in 1785, and offers undergraduate programs in art, sciences, literature, and humanities, long and short programs, as well as courses, degrees, post-graduate programs, specializations, diplomas, etc., bringing together more than 40,000 students and 6,000 professors. The university operates two campuses in M\u00e9rida, and about a dozen faculties spread throughout the city.\nTwo other more recently founded universities are based in M\u00e9rida: the Universidad Nacional Abierta (UNA), which offers undergraduate distance-learning courses; and, from 2006, the UNEFA, which is a military university specializing in Engineering for undergraduates.  The main university centers to be found in the city are given below:\n\nUniversity of the Andes (ULA)\nUniversidad Nacional Abierta (UNA)\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de las Fuerzas Armadas (UNEFA)\nSantiago Mari\u00f1o Polytechnic Institute (IUPSM)\nColegio Universitario Hotel Escuela de Los Andes Venezolanos (CUHELAV)\nSantiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida Institute (ISCM)\nAntonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre University Institute\nCrist\u00f3bal Mendoza Technological University Institute\nLa Frontera Technological Institute (IUFRONT)Primary and Secondary EducationThere are many institutions dedicated to primary and secondary education, most of which are public, under the control of the national or regional governments.  Of particular note is the Liceo Libertador. The largest education centers in the city can be found among the many private Catholic schools.  Colegio La Salle de M\u00e9rida and Colegio San Luis are among the largest with several hundred pupils each.  These are run by governing bodies Fundaci\u00f3n La Salle and Fundaci\u00f3n Don Bosco, respectively.  However, all schools come ultimately under the auspices of The Venezuelan Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n.\nOther educational institutions worth mentioning are the schools dedicated to languages, sport and music. M\u00e9rida is known as a destination to learn Spanish. In 2007 Jakera Spanish School was voted by the Language industry (STAR awards) as one of the top four Spanish schools worldwide. There are important conservatories, orchestras and choirs based in the city.  Most are linked to the universities and specialize in many kinds of instruments, as well as lyrical interpretation and the development of the singing voice. Amongst the language schools, of predominance are those that teach English, though French and Italian schools can also be found.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nThe greatest network of libraries is that of the University of the Andes. Each school has a specialized library, as well as the multidisciplinary libraries located in La Hechicera, the sports division, the administrative division, and a number of other smaller libraries, adding up to more than a dozen under the direction of Serbiula. Moreover, ULA owns the largest digital archive of the country, available to the public for research and education.\nBesides the university libraries, M\u00e9rida has the Biblioteca Bolivariana (Bolivarian Library), which is also an area of exhibits and historical displays, a branch of the National Library of Venezuela, and the public library Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, subsidized by the government. Other public and private institutions such as schools, churches, and language institutes have their own minor libraries to be used by their members.\nAdditionally, land originally set aside for a metropolitan library in 2006 was reallocated for the use of National Experimental University of the Armed Forces, and a new site for the proposed library has yet to be granted.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe city's culture closely resembles that of Andean Folklore and is in fact the main, if not defining, example of this folklore. Inhabitants of M\u00e9rida, with deep connections to their culture, are characterized by their well-preserved traditions and slow, unhurried way of life. The city itself can be recognized by its many well-preserved  colonial parks and buildings, in addition to its famous social scene, the local art and craftwork, and the unique regional cuisine.\n\n\n=== Museums, cultural centers, and theaters ===\nArchaeological Museum\nArchdiocesan Museum\nMuseum of Science and Technology\nMuseum of Colonial Art\nMuseum of Modern Art\nJuan F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez House of Culture\nTulio Febres Cordero Cultural Center\nC\u00e9sar Renginfo TheaterNot many know that the Archdiocesan Museum of M\u00e9rida houses the second and third oldest bells in the world, the so-called Ave Mar\u00eda bell from the year 909 and San Pedro of 912.\n\n\n=== Festivals and local customs ===\nIn addition to national holidays and events, several festivals take place and have origins in M\u00e9rida. Most are religious celebrations, and a few \u2013 such as the city's famous \"Feria del Sol\" or \"Sun Fair\" that takes place in the beginning of February \u2013 are of an international scale.\nFor M\u00e9rida, the most important and famous religious traditions are those celebrated by the city's Christian devotees during Christmas and Holy Week. These festivities include La Quema del A\u00f1o Viejo (Burning of the Past Year), La Pasi\u00f3n Viviente de Cristo (Christ's Living Passion) and La Paradura del Ni\u00f1o (Christ Child's Standing) celebrated with prayers, song, fireworks, wine and cake.\nAnother of the more popular local customs (those without official government sanction) are the Caravanas Estudiantiles, student processionals organized by and for high school or university graduates upon earning their degree. In recent years, this tradition has been extended to include younger students who have completed their primary or elementary education. Such celebrations usually occur during the first days of June for high school graduates, and throughout nearly the entire year for college graduates. Similar festivities can be found in other parts of the country, but the Caravanas of M\u00e9rida have a special relevance and importance given the city's large student population.\nOther customs firmly rooted in the M\u00e9ridan tradition, usually associated with fixed dates, include Patinatas Navide\u00f1as or \"Christmas skating\", which occurs in the city streets throughout the month of December; the Fiesta de las Velas on December 7 when in the evening all the electricity is turned off and some 18,000 candles are lit; the Fiesta de San Benito between January 12 and 31 celebrated with a drummers processions and street dancing; or the Vasallos de la Candelaria, another typical festivity with children and street dancing.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe cuisine of the M\u00e9rida region differs notably from that of the rest of the nation. Among the most notable differences is the arepa andina (Andean Arepa), a variant of the traditional Venezuelan arepa made from  wheat flour instead of the more common corn. This difference in ingredients is due primarily to the fact that the Andean region was one of the few places in the country where wheat historically has been harvested. Another notable dish is the pizca andina, common to M\u00e9rida, T\u00e1chira and the Colombian Andes, a soup with potato, milk, long onion, and parsley. Other important dishes are prepared with trout, the only fish found in the region.\nThe city's typical brightened sweets, made from a base of milk and other ingredients, are also notable. There is a historical tradition of such sweets, which are said to originate in the convents where they were prepared in the 19th century. Also, one can find alfajores, aliados, and almojabanas. Popular drinks include corn liquor, mistella, and \"donkey's milk\", which is known as \"Andean punch.\"\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe traditional music of the city is marked by waltz rhythms. It also includes regional or national rhythms, such as pasillos,  a type of merengue and bambucos. The music of M\u00e9rida, like its people, is recognizable by the laid back rhythms. The use of the violin and mandolin are almost mandatory in the music style.  Additionally, the city is commonly the birthplace of many rock and punk bands, among other genres. The city is also home to the M\u00e9rida State Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n== Entertainment and tourism ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is the quintessential touristic city in Venezuela, being one of the most sought-after destinations by national and international travelers.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\nLodging accommodations can be found to fit all budgets, including pensions and apartments for tourists with basic amenities. At least half of the hotels are located within the city, which is about 35% of the total number statewide.  All in all, there are about 2,650 beds available. Moreover, there will be three large five-star hotels added before 2007, when M\u00e9rida becomes the host of the soccer event Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\n\n=== Shops ===\nThe main commercial area of M\u00e9rida lies within the historic downtown. However, all kinds of services can be found in the suburbs. Two notable destinations by locals and tourists alike are M\u00e9rida's Mercado Principal (Main Market) and the Helader\u00eda Coromoto (Coromoto Ice cream Parlor). The Mercado Principal is famous for its variety of folk art, gastronomy, produce, groceries, and other local and regional goods. Helader\u00eda Coromoto is well known because it offers the greatest variety of ice cream flavors worldwide, with more than 800 choices.\n\n\n=== Shopping malls ===\nFor those who like to go shopping and spend the day enjoying stores or food courts, M\u00e9rida offers the following shopping malls: Las Tapias and Millenium located in Andr\u00e9s Bello Avenue; Alto Prado and Pie de Monte located in Los Pr\u00f3ceres Avenue; and Rodeo Plaza located in Las Am\u00e9ricas Avenue.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nAs a city with many students and tourists, M\u00e9rida enjoys a broad network of places open at night, mostly composed of clubs and bars. There are also various caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and two movie theaters. Furthermore, a number of cultural events constantly take place in these locations. Notable among these events are the concerts of the Symphonic Orchestra of M\u00e9rida, as well as concerts by local bands. Many of the night-clubs and discos open until late at night, with a few of them staying open until sunrise.\n\n\n== Media and communication ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThere are three television stations which broadcast from M\u00e9rida. Two of these are general-interest stations, airing programs including news, entertainment, and culture. The third is an institutional and educational channel and belongs to the Universidad de Los Andes.\nThe stations are:\n\nTelevisora Andina de M\u00e9rida, (TAM)\nULATV\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nThe principal radio stations of the state also broadcast from M\u00e9rida. These stations are mostly privately owned, though in recent years some public community radio stations have emerged.\n\n\n=== Press ===\nSome of the best-known newspapers from M\u00e9rida are:\n\nEl Correo de Los Andes\nCambio de Siglo [2]\nDiario Frontera [3]\nDiario Pico Bol\u00edvar [4]\nCultura Tatuy\n\n\n== Sports ==\nM\u00e9rida has a strong athletic infrastructure; noteworthy among others is the Guillermo Soto Rosa Stadium, an important soccer facility and the old headquarters of the local soccer team. During the last month of 2005, the city was host to the 2005 Andean National Games, an event for which numerous athletic facilities were built, including the Cinco \u00c1guilas Blancas (Five White Eagles) Sports Complex\u2014a 42 000-seat stadium and the current home stadium of the local team, Estudiantes de M\u00e9rida F. C.. Soccer is the most popular and widely supported sport, but given the city's location, a variety of extreme sports are also practiced as well.\nIn addition to the aforementioned soccer, the current athletic infrastructure also supports a wide array of other traditional sports, including tennis, basketball, baseball, and Venezuelan sports such as bolas criollas.\nThe Metropolitan Stadium of M\u00e9rida, dedicated on May 25, 2007 with a friendly match between Venezuela and Honduras, was host to the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\n\n== See also ==\nM\u00e9rida (state)\nLibertador Municipality, M\u00e9rida\n\n\n== References ==\nSecondary literature(in Spanish) Historia de M\u00e9rida, Carlos Chalbaud Zerpa, Universidad de Los Andes. 1985, M\u00e9rida, Venezuela.\n(in Spanish) Enciclopedia de Venezuela.

          "Apparently Merida used to be the richest city in Mexico. This brilliantly restored house of a Spanish nobleman, furnished as it would have been for a wealthy city father at the start of the 20th century, gives a glimpse of life for those who enjoyed those riches. The museum is",

          "Francisco de Montejo was the conquistador of the Yucatan (actually three guys by the same name did it), and here was where the residence was built. The decor does not date from the 16th century, but does portray what a well-to-do Merida family might have had as a lifestyle. The",

          "Our guide explained that at one time this home was over one city block in size and was built back in the 1500's. It was still a residence in the 80's. Right now it's basically just a facade with several restored rooms and painting exhibits. It's free and well worth spending",
          "We stopped in the Casa de Montejo during a recent trip to Merida. The house is free and gorgeous, so well worth a visit. If you are familiar with the DF be sure and see the painting of the view a long time ago from the Hacienda de los Morales and be surprised at the different",

          "Casa de Montejo is located in the Plaza Grande and is a must see for first timers to Merida! It is free and takes just 20-30 minutes to visit, and well worth the time. The casa remains decorated as it was when the Montejo family occupied it and gives visitors an opportunity to",
          "Well maintained museum to the conquerors of the Yucatan. The home shows how well the European folks lived who founded Merida after their arrival. Rumor has it that there are tunnels beneath the house allowing for the escape of the residence should the local people not want",
          "One of the reasons to spend half a day on Plaza Grande. The casa is quite lovely and completely different on the inside, which does NOT date to the mid-16th century as does the exterior of the structure. However, the structure alone is interesting.",
          "A must-see if you love residential architecture. All in original condition, including fresh flowers!",

          "This truly ancient building turns out to encompass an absolute goldmine of architectural genius. The dream of conquistador Francisco de Montejo Adelantado, the actual construction was done from 1542 to 1549, apparently overseen by his son, Francisco de Montejo, and his nephew",
          "A nice tour of one the mansions that sisal built. The tour can be given in Spanish or English, be sure to check the time. Very interesting tour. The house is rather modest compared to what you expect looking at it from the outside. Loved the pasta tiles and furnishings.",
          "This small museum, owned by Banamex, one of the largest banks in Mexico, is a nice stop while visiting the downtown area. Several small rooms, decorated in a slightly eclectic collection of styles, provides a sense of how old Merida houses looked like. Make sure to stop at the",

          "Highly recommend a tour of this house... Banamex (sponsor of the museum) has hired very well-trained and professional guides, who have a solid knowledge of the history of the home and of the Yucatan generally. It's a fairly short tour (and in Spanish), but it was very",

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.  It joins M\u00e9rida with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Valladolid and ultimately Canc\u00fan.\nM\u00e9rida-Tizim\u00edn (Federal 176) connects M\u00e9rida with Tizim\u00edn (2nd. largest city in Yucat\u00e1n).\nM\u00e9rida-Teabo-Peto known as Mundo Maya Road Carretera del Mundo Maya, its utilized in both \"convent route\" Ruta de los Conventos, and linking the ancient maya city of Mayap\u00e1n and Chetumal, state capitol of Quintana Roo\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.

All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

          "We saw a ton of animals, my favorite route was the feline route. They have a lot of food stands on your way into the zoo but beware, NO FOOD OR DRINKS ALLOWED inside the zoo. So eat your snacks before or after the animal sightings. Not the prettiest of places or even",
          "Cages are wayyy too small, not clean, animals suffer too hot temperatures, there is no toys/stimulations for them in the cages, many suffers OCD, stress and boredom problems because of all this.. don't be fooled by the train and shops... Don't spend your money there if you don't",
          "We did not attend this zoo because the care of the animals is poor and we did not want to support this. While we were in Merida, a zebra, native to AFRICA, died of heat stroke. It is so intensely hot and humid in Merida April through August it is not appropriate even for",
          "Full disclosure: I am not a fan of zoos in general. If you want to enjoy a few hours in a fairly nice park, grab a snack, people watch, take the kids on a few carinval rides, etc. then, yes, go. On the zoo side, this is an old school type. By that I mean animals in pretty",
          "We strolled down calle 59 to this park one afternoon when we were exploring Merida and faintly annoyed with the nonstop hawking that happens in the touristed centro. It is locals only here, and a beautiful respite from urbanity. Green and shady, with fountains! The park is",

          "From the reviews on Trip Advisor, we were very nervous about going to the zoo. My grandson read the reviews with me and was prepared for the worst conditions but we still wanted to go because so many people in the community raved about it. What we experienced was an authentic",
          "It is a very fun place, there are many things to do, the best is the wide variety of shops where you can buy various sandwiches such as churros, nachos, etc, there is a place where you can go horseback riding and the zoo is amazing.",
          "I felt so bad for these poor animals. The condition they are kept in is pretty bad. Big cats in small pens, maybe the size of a backyard pool .... same as the hippos. Submerged in small pools filled with stagnant water. Monkey cages weren\u2019t much better or bigger. Kids loved it",
          "Whether for families or anyone who enjoys a nice park and zoo, this is the nicest zoo we have ever visited. It isn\u2019t the largest zoo but it has a huge variety of animals and birds. The small train ride through the park is fun, cheap and worth the wait in the queue! The walk",

          "A great activity with kids, they loved climbing into the truck for the trip around the animals. We had ostriches running alongside and could have reached out to touch a zebra which the kids thought was super cool.",

          "If you are looking for a nice family outing that will not cost much, this is the place. I was very surprised at the size of the park, and the wide range of animals found at the zoo. There are small amusement rides for the kids, a sky tram and train for all ages. Some of the",

          "Definitely take the kids to this zoo. Plenty of animals and wildlife to see and learn about. It is very cheap and affordable. After you have finished visiting and walking the entire zoo, take a relaxing little train ride around the zoo and surrounding park area. It is handicap",
          "It is a very local attraction with lots of families visiting from the area. It has a lot of snack bars and places to buy trinkets and sweets. There is a great train ride around the park which only costs $1 each. There are numerous amusement rides as well as paths to walk",

          "Took our grandson here. Even though you can walk up very close to most of the cages, the fact that the cages were so tiny was very upsetting. The pacing of the animals and complete lethargic look of them was very sad. Yes, this zoo is Free, but perhaps if an admission was paid,",
          "I went to the zoo to see animals we don't have in Europe. And i regret going because I like to see animals especially wild ones treated right and with good living conditions. Which was definitely not the case there. I think that with the amount of visitor the zoo should improve",
          "Our two kids aged 12 and 10 loved the zoo and seeing he locals at play. A really interesting experience with good collection of well kept animals. Good little train ride too. They have great collection of both g cats and if you go now you can see some baby ocelots!",
          "I'm amazed there isn't any more 1 stars. The animals are kept in tiny cages! My husband and I also saw 3 huge lions kept in a cage the size of a small bathroom (the private door was open - I suppose the public are not supposed to see that) it was awful! No animal should be kept",
          "While parts of the zoo are run down (the kids playing / ride area), the actually zoo part (re: animals) is amazing. I explored the zoo while doing a solo trip to Merida and was actually surprised at how well kept it was - considering the visit was free! Loved the hippo's and",

          "I've always had mixed feelings about zoos, they are definitely a good way for many people to have the opportunity of seeing animals that they wouldn't be able to see in any other way. However, it is always a little sad to see beautiful animals that are caged. Th animals are in",
          "If you are an animal lover this place is probably not for you. The animals are in small cages, often with little foliage or anything to amuse them. There is a fair amount of pacing backwards and forwards by tigers and big animals. Sadly none of the animals look happy and one",
          "This is a Zoo worth visiting with small children. It's definitely not very exciting for adults or for teenagers. You can spend a full morning or afternoon at this place. Try to avoid the noon hours due to the heat especially with young children. The train ride is always a",

          "Probably skip this if you are an animal lover. It's like British zoo's in the 80's. Particularly the big cats and the large primates seemed to be having the hardest time. Wild Bengal tigers consider a truly huge area to be their territory so the small cage size seemed to be",

          "The place was not modern and sofisticated, but in its simplicity it was Amazing. A great experience!",
          "Absolutely heart breaking as these animals are clearly suffering. Tiny cages, lack of shade and water in the baking heat. Hippos don't have enough water to submerge and clear evidence the sun is burning them causing pigmentation marks. The baby was trying desperately to go on",

          "A depressing, horrible place. Animals are in tiny cages, there is no enrichment whatsoever or stimulation for the animals - not even trees, and it is right next to a main road. There are zebras locked in what is basically a basketball court. Why anyone would go here, let alone",
          "This was the only free zoo we have visited. There is no queue to get in and plenty of things to keep children entertained such as the mini train. The animals seem well looked after although ultimately free range should be the way of the future.",
          "We enjoyed the zoo. we were not sure what to expect when we decided to go to the zoo but we were pleasantly surprised. The animals were in very good shape and the area for them was well presented. We got to see a set of triplet white tiger cubs that were born there. They were",
          "This is an old fashioned zoo with small plan cages and a decent variety of animals. The bird aviary was a lovely setting with very few birds in it - a some ducks in it and several caged birds. There is a train ride and several kiddie rides in the park, as well as a large",
          "I can't imagine anyone visiting Merida and not visiting here. The park is a zoo, park and amusement park open from 6am to 6pm. The train ride tickets are 1 peso or under 9 cents Canadian (March 3 2016) the zoo is multi leveled and far better than a dozen or so other zoo s we",

          "Big for a park, small for a zoo. Big areas for children to play in although sadly not very green due to the hot temperatures. Not much variety in the animals, but those that they do have are well kept.",
          "This was a good activity as it was free and I didn't know which way the weather was going to go but I felt the conditions that the animals were kept in was atrocious. The enclosures were far too small for all the animals and overall wasn't a pleasant experience",
          "Don't usually care for zoos. However this was very humane and the caretakers very kind.One thing I felt was cool was being able to stand on different platforms that allowed better interaction. For example, the giraffe platform was high enough to look directly into the girafe's",
          "This zoo is a step back to the kinds of experiences children could have in the 50s and 60s. Children playing freely everywhere, incredible varieties of animals, birds and reptilian species, children's rides, playgrounds, food stands, mini train ride (for one peso!), and much",
          "Merida is a city of approx. 800000 to a million people and the average property tax is around $30.00 US. With such a small resource for funds, this free admission zoo is fantastic. In my opinion, the animals are healthy and there are many varieties to view. Albeit some of the",
          "The animals are very healthy and well cared for, I was really impressed by their large cats - they had a lot of them, and all of them were well cared for and loved. They even had hippos, a giraffe and lions and tigers, oh my! Really a great zoo, I felt I should leave a donation",
          "We had 3 and 1 year old we went here twice cause it loved it so much. I have to say the train ride was probably one of the best, you get to see the zoo animals and its a nice big loop. The play area is great. Highly recommend break from normal touristy things. And its rally",
          "Every time we come to Merida, we go the the zoo. There is a park for the kids to climb for hours. The animals are easily seen from the neat $1 Peso train ride! Love it.",
          "Loved seeing all the monkeys. It was an older style zoo. A bit of an historic relic. You could get very close to all the animals. Three feet from many fences. Lions, Tigers, Jaguars, Panthers, Hippos, Giraffe, Zebras, Camel, Flamingos, Deer, Rams, Birds, and many, many",
          "Don't visit this place! Being kept in small cages, many of the animals are showing severe abnormal behaviour. It was extremely sad to see them in such state and we were depressed after this trip.",
          "It's a nice place to visit. It's a municipal zoo, not private, and it's free. The size of the cages can be somewhat distressing but the animals seem in good shape. There's a nice variety of animals, the employees are friendly and there are play areas for the kids.",
          "This is a great zoo located in Merida. Lots of animals and a very clean park. Great place to spend the day.",
          "After reading the many negative posts here about the place, I was ready for the depths of inconsiderate human depravity. Sorry, folks. I've seen far worse in our civilized north. This is a small city-funded facility that does the best it can to feed and house the many animals",
          "It has a train that goes around the zoo. Just jump on the train (it is not expensive), look around and you are ready to go. The animal section is not good at all.",
          "We have not been to a zoo in over 30 years and really enjoyed the visit.Attractive landscaping and well maintained and the animals, etc seem well taken care of. We enjoyed the excitement of the children and look forward to returning with friends with children in the future.",
          "This is your typical mexican park, I do not think its great for touists. The grounds are dirty, kids are playing in revolving disgusting water. The train was ok my daughter enjoyed it. The zoo was absolutely horrible. Each aminal is cages with little to nothing resembling real",
          "We brought our kids here because it topped a lot of lists of fun things to do in Merida. The park was great and my nearly 3 year old son had a blast. but the zoo was so completely awful that we left quickly, and I found myself nearly in tears. The enclosures were tiny little",
          "I am not sure what planet the people giving this place above a 1 rating live on, but I look forward to the day I do not have to share it with them. The poor animals in this zoo are kept in very small enclosures and have no stimulation, apart from watching people leer at them",
          "This zoo should be shut down and condemned. Shame. I understand you're a poor country and what not, but it's awful to see the way these animals, and some endangered, are kept and treated. Cages aren't even big enough to turn around in. Filthy grounds. Many wounded and uncared",
          "I went to this exhibition of misery because I thought it was a BOTANICAL GARDEN , it is not. What I saw was pathetic animals packed into small cages, pacing back and forth or lying motionless on the dirt, it was disturbing. The saddest of all was this huge primate sitting alone",
          "I had low expectations for a free zoo in Mexico, but this was actually a fun visit! Great selection of animals, including what had to be at least 8 tigers. I was truly impressed by the exotics they had! In addition, many of them are very playful and fun to watch. On the",
          "It was free and although the cages are small it was great to be able to be so close to the animals. They all seemed to be doing well and well cared for. I would recommend it to anyone.",
          "Hard to write a review on this. Some things were excellent like its free, the animals all seemed well and fat, and they have a great selection of animals. However as we walked and talked we noticed some things.. 1 way too much area has been given for kiddy rides while the",
          "We spent hours here. The whole zoo is so well done you wonder how it can be free. The variety of animals is also impressive. Rather large hippos and an assortment of cheeky primates were some favorites. There were many lions and quite a few tigers. They have quite the",
          "Kids young and old will enjoy this historic zoo with an impressive selection of animals. It features an award winning breeding program for large cats and only animals suitable for the climate in M\u00e9rida. There are rides for the kids including a train, chairlift, and boats.",
          "It's was a very pleasant zoo with lots of verity animals. A great place to come with children or with your couple. Don't miss the flamingo, jaguar, lions and the tropical rear colorful birds.",
          "Great with kids. The zoo is free and stocked with animals. Yes, the cages seem a bit small by current zoo standards, but the animals appear happy and well looked after. Loads of big cats (Tigers/Lions/Jaguars/Leopards). Cheap fun family orientated train through the zoo. The",
          "While I think that Zoos that aren't in the animals best interest should be banned, from a selfish point of view I had a great time at Merida zoo. Its free and there were so many happy children there. While the enclosures were not largest in most cases the animals were paired",
          "While small, this zoo is a real treat. You get to be up-close-and-personal with a variety of animals. The monkey house is a treat and so is the aviary. Best thing.....it is free. Avoid it on weekend or when school is not in session because it will be packed.",
          "This marvelous park and zoo is one of Merida's treasures. I always love to return here. It remains a unique park in Merida where families go every weekend to enjoy the ride on the train around and through the zoo, and other lovely rides for children. I am lucky to live close",
          "I do rescue work here in the Yucatan with dogs and cats so to see big animals like zebras, giraffes, etc. in tiny exclosures with minimal life support is not oniy depressing - it's criminal! I admit I have a particular fondness for cats and to this day I have nightmares about",
          "What a wonderful little day trip, the zoo is free for everyone. There is lots of family enjoying the park & animals. Food & trinkets for purchase. Nice day trip",
          "We walked around the zoo and saw a huge range of animals, snakes, and birds. I particularly loved the birds. The line up for the train was long, but if you have young kids I think it is worth lining up for the experience. My husband insisted that I go for a ride on the small",
          "The zoo is in a big park with rides & stuff for kiddies. It\u2019s all free, and full of pretty Mayan babies and their families on Sundays. If you want to be utterly charmed by the strength of the family life of these good people, pay a visit. Oh, and there are still a lot of",
          "Let me qualify my review by saying I am fully aware that this zoo does not meet the modern standards of zoological parks and the issue some folks have with caging animals, etc. I however thought the zoo was great. Yes its old and dated but I think its kind of charming and nice",
          "We just returned from 8 nights in beautiful, friendly M\u00e9rida, and our 3 teenage daughters ranked our trip to the Parque Centenario y Zool\u00f3gico as the highlight of their vacation!!! This zoo if pretty small, but admission is free, the park is breathtaking, and the animals--even",
          "This zoo is a travesty. The enclosures are unkempt, stinky, the water dirty and the animals look awful. There was a zebra with an injured hoof, and we unfortunately saw one of the jaguars vomiting. The playground and fountain are worth visiting if you're traveling with",
          "Awesome Zoo, very different to others and very well kept and maintained. Enjoyed it fully, specially the birds area.",
          "I loved this park. It is right in the middle of the city and big and beautiful. The mature tropical foliage and huge trees were as breathtaking as the animals. It was much more than I expected and and a very interesting. I loved the big cats. We actually did not allow enough",
          "Yes, this is a zoo; yes, it is an anachronism by modern zoo design standards; yes, many of the enclosures are hard to view - all of that said, it is a huge park, right in the middle of a bustling city of almost 900,000 people and it's totally free. Most of the visitors are",
          "We visited the zoo specifically to see toucans (my husband's favourite bird); we did, so our visit was successful. However, I'm not sure I'd recommend it otherwise. It reminded me of how zoos used to look back in the 50s with the animals kept in small cages etc. Notwithstanding,",
          "I don't think there should be any zoos but this one should be closed!!!!! The cages are small and the animals looked and acted strssed!!!!",
          "Sweet place to visit. Fun rides, great playground and animals.Great place to spend a few hours! What more can you ask for?",
          "Great place to go for free. All the locals love to take the kids here. Straight shot on calle 59 just walk opposite traffic direction and it will be on left. Lots of animal,clean and they have an enclosed area full of birds that you can go into. There is a small train you can",
          "The Merida Zoo is a difficult attraction to rate. In general, I don't like zoos, except those which allow the animals a large habitat that's as much as possible like their natural wild space. This zoo, located in Merida's Centennial Park, is not like that; it's an old fashioned",
          "It is so nice a NO expensive .... I recomend you a tour on \"Trenecito\" the cost is just ONE PESO !!!",
          "Well if you disapprove of Zoos you won't be there, but if you are likely to visit it you may well feel that you are back in the 1960s, it's free so lots of families visit, and there is a little train you can pay to go on round the Zoo. I didn't go round the whole place, but it",
          "I was surprised how many animals were in the free zoo. The whole place was charming. Families with children riding a little train. Everything looked like from the 1950's but was painted brightly and well maintained.",
          "The park itself is beautifully laid out, with a number of activities for children that are free, such as the amazing playground with a real airplane for kids to climb on and a water fountain which spurts jets of water children run screaming in and out of in the summer when it is",
          "The animals, and there are many, are better cared for than in many zoos. The kids love this place as there are many things to see and do. I suggest wearing a hat to protect your head from possible bird projectiles.",
          "This zoo is very clean, and full of interesting animals. It has a very nice train which goes around the park with a guide.",
          "I like the park setting in the city. Small of the uniquely shaped buildings reflect some historic events held at the zoo over time. Did not ride the little train through the park. Will do that on my next visit.",
          "Spent an afternoon here- some of the enclosures seem a little small but the animals look well cared for and the kids loved it- They have horseriding in the park as well, and the playground has an aircraft built in as a slide which was a delight for our 5 year old.",
          "lots of stuff to keep kids and adults interested. shady, and a great way to pass an afternoon.",
          "Amazing and free! Within a lively park the zoo has many animals. My only concern was there was not a lot of room for the large cats.",
          "Yes, lovely and delightful. Walking paths, many many trees, interesting exhibits, and all for free - unless you choose to ride the train for 1 peso. We are so glad we chose this as a morning activity during our stay in Merida. I will say, though, that it is also very popular",
          "The Centenary Park is actually very sweet, and a must if you have children. Entry to both the park and the zoo is free, so money is no object. The park has a number of interesting activities for children (at very low prices) such as a little train which goes around the park and",
          "For the Families that go to Merida, this centro park is filled with trees and animal and is a great afternoon location to take the kids and a lunch to sit under the cool afternoon trees and visit the animal. Very little money neede here. Beautiful suroundings in the historical",
          "If you like zoos I would recommend that everyone take a couple hours and visit this museum. First of all it is free, but also you can see the animals really close-up and I was surprised how the animals all seemed very happy. The thing that amused us most is that the kiddie",
          "This zoo is excellent, and I regularly take my kids here. Though the cages could be bigger and more modern, there are a wide variety of animals and they are actually fairly well kept. Admission is free. There is a little train that goes around the park that costs a peso, and",
          "We hadn't know abour park but drove by it so went the next day. Everything exceeded my expectations. Zoo was large, varied and absoloutely free. Almost every animal imaginable and they had it. we have 3 kids 1,3,5 and there was tonnes for them to do and super chaep (there was a",
          "As interesting & beautiful as Downtown Merida is, it doesn't have a lot directed at kids. However, Centenario is only 5-10 mins away in taxi, at the junction of Calle 65 & Avenida Itzaes. Entrance is free & inside you can find playgrounds, a small zoo, go-kart circuits, a",
          "Like many things in Mexico, this park was a flashback to the way the USA used to be. The playground had equipment that was actually fun, and would probably be banned in today's lawsuit-ridden America. The zoo was full of fairly small enclosures where the animals were displayed"

          "I love Parque Hidalgo for it's great aethetics and atmosphere. It's a great little oasis in Central Merida, and the bonus is that there are three beautiful, historic hotels surrounding the park. Go inside to check out each of them. We also had a nice breakfast inside the",
          "The park has 3 hotels however, only two have outside eating places, Hotel Caribe and La Mansion. You don't have to be a guest at the hotels to enjoy either of their meals. Nice place to meet up with friends",

          "I spent more than my fair share of time sitting on the benches (in the shade of course) chatting with locals, trying to practice my Spanish while they were trying to sell me trinkets, a Panama hat, or a guayabara. As others have noted there are lots of decent restaurants",
          "Small park with wifi shade benches and a quaint artisans market in the evenings. There are some delicious restaurants and nice reasonably priced hotels.",
          "This park is right outside our hotel door (El Gran). Free WiFi, lots of benches and shade. It's a great place to stop and rest during your walk around town. It's very close to the main plaza but has a much calmer feel. It comes alive Thursday evenings with music and craft",

          "In this perfect little park right in the middle of everything is a microcosm of the city. Hawkers selling wares, menu wielding guys trying to entice you to come visit their establishments and lots,of folks just resting their tired feet. One could spend hours here!",
          "My Hotel Caribe was on this square. Nice little plaza with vendors selling arts and crafts. I bought my Amber Necklace from Noberto and his wife on this plaza. You can order a meal from the Manson Hotels Kitchen or the Hotel Caribes or the Grand Plaza Hotels who all have tables",

          "As many have noted, this is a peaceful spot surrounded by some lovely hotels with outdoor restaurants and a pub. I Often came here, just a block or two from Plaza Grande, to avoid the masses and chaos there. Be sure to go inside the hotels to check out the architecture; we",

          "Small gem of a park, a block from the central square. Pleasant cafes where one could while away the hours talking or reading or just stop off for a quick refuel with excellent Yucatecan coffee. Do beware of touts. Sometimes even the waiters will suggest shops to visit. Just a",

          "I used to visit Merida quite often, but hadn't been here for about 20 years. I was very disappointed in the increased traffic and difficulty walking about town. The two central squares are still great for enjoying the people watching, but the sprawl, makes it difficult to use",

          "Although it can be a bit noisy at times with the traffic and the locals selling their wears, this little park has a perfece location in front of three older hotels with sidewalk restaurants and shops surrounding it. Sit at one of the cafes and have a cool drink while watching",
          "This square is lovely due to the large almond trees and palms, the abundance of seating, sidewalk restaurants and people moving around. We love to go set and enjoy something cool, listen to the live entertainment from one of the cafes, watch the hawkers selling fans and shawls",

          "I spent 6 months studying with Abel and Melva....not only are they incredible artists, they're the warmest people you'll ever meet. It was a privilege to watch the thought process become something tangible. Their work is a fine combination of imagination and technique.",

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida, officially known as Santiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida, is the capital of the municipality of Libertador and the state of M\u00e9rida, and is one of the main cities of the Venezuelan Andes. It was founded in 1558 by Captain Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez, forming part of Nueva Granada, but later became part of the Captaincy General of Venezuela and played an active role in the War of Independence.\nThe capital city's population is 204,879 inhabitants, and the metropolitan area, that includes the municipality of Libertador, reaches 345,489 people (Census 2001). The city accounts for 28% of the total population of M\u00e9rida State, which has more than 750,000 inhabitants (Census 2001). It is home to the University of Los Andes and the Archdiocese of M\u00e9rida. It also has the highest and longest cable car in the world. It is the largest student and tourist center of western Venezuela. The mass transit system (Troleb\u00fas M\u00e9rida) is available as a means of tourist transport.\nThis city sits on a plateau nestled in the valley of the Chama River, which runs from end to end. The town of M\u00e9rida is located at an altitude of 1,600 metres (5,200 feet). As background on the horizon rises the country's highest summit: the Pico Bol\u00edvar with an altitude of 4,981 metres (16,342 feet).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nM\u00e9rida was founded by Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez on October 9, 1558 in one of the Pamplonian mining expeditions he led. The first settlement of M\u00e9rida was not the current one but 30 kilometres (19 miles) to the south, in Xam\u00fa, where today stands Lagunillas. Nevertheless, in November 1559, Juan de Maldonado moved the settlement to nearby El Punto (presently the Zumba area), because of constant confrontations with the native neighbours.Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez's foundation had not been authorized by the New Granadian Authorities, so in 1560 they sent Juan de Maldonado to arrest Juan Rodr\u00edguez and regularize the new city. On June 24 Maldonado moved M\u00e9rida to its present location on the plateau and rechristened it as Santiago de los Caballeros. The city then came to be governed by the corregimiento of Tunja until 1607, when it became itself a corregimiento of the Audiencia of Santa Fe.In 1622, M\u00e9rida became the capital of the Governorate of M\u00e9rida, whose chief official established his residence there. The city and territory were part of New Granada until 1777, when it was integrated into the Captaincy of Venezuela.\nThe city was elevated to the status of an episcopal see in 1785. This led to the creation of a seminary, which in 1811 became the University of the Andes.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe city was named after the founder Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez, who called so in honor of his hometown of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.\nHowever, Juan de Maldonado renamed it as San Juan de las Nieves. In 1559 the name changed again, opting this time for Santiago de los Caballeros. Gradually, it was adopting the name of Santiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida, combining the variants that had been appointed to the city until then.\nThe word M\u00e9rida comes from the Latin \"em\u00e9rita\", from Emeritus, one who has merit, which also references to veteran Roman soldiers who were discharged from the army after completion of their mandatory service commitment. Another feature common to both the Spanish and the Venezuelan M\u00e9ridas is that in both cities, there is a tributary of the main river with the name Albarregas.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n \n\nThe city is located in the center of the Venezuelan Andes, in a wide plain in the valley of the Chama River, between the Sierra Nevada de M\u00e9rida to the southeast and the Sierra La Culata to the northwest. The old quarter of the city is on the alluvial plain known as Tatuy.\nM\u00e9rida has four principal rivers and some smaller seasonal streams in the less urbanized parts of the city, these last ones have a significant water flow only in times of heavy precipitation. The most important river is the Chama, followed by the Albarregas, which cross the plain and divide it into two parts: the Banda Occidental (west bank) and the Banda Oriental (east bank). These two rivers run from one end of the city to the other. The other two principal rivers are the Mucuj\u00fan and the Milla, which flow into the Chama and Albarregas. In the lower part of the city is found the La Rosa lake, one of some 200 lakes in M\u00e9rida State.\nIn the center of the city the terrain, located on a plain, is almost flat. Nonetheless, there is an average incline of 3 to 7 degrees, which causes a difference in altitude between the high and low parts of the city of more than 400 m (1,300 ft), the average being 1,630 m (5,350 ft) above sea level at the Plaza Bol\u00edvar. However, the areas surrounding the city are rough and uneven, situated in the valleys formed by the Chama and Albarregas rivers and the Sierra Nevada and Sierra de La Culata ranges.\nThe valley in which the city is located was formed approximately 40 to 60 million years ago with the creation of the Venezuelan Andes and its continuous erosion by the area's water systems. Its soils consist of alluvial sediment and clay. Below the city runs the major tectonic fault in the western part of the country, the Bocon\u00f3 fault, which forms part of the South American Plate.\nThe vegetation in the interior of the city consists of medium to tall trees, and ferns (Pteridophyte), located mainly near the basin of the Albarregas river. On the outskirts of M\u00e9rida, one finds non-urbanized areas, where sub-mountainous and seasonal jungle vegetation predominates. On the other hand, vast coniferous forests extend toward the south, where they were planted some years ago. Toward the north and east, one finds cloud forests.\nSignificant among the local fauna are important populations of certain small and medium-sized birds such as hummingbirds and parrots (Psittacidae), spread particularly to the south of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nM\u00e9rida lies between a tropical monsoon climate (Am), bordering on a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cwb), with cooler temperatures than other cities in Venezuela, with dry winters.  Though the emission greenhouse gases has caused a rise in temperatures, this has been less, in relative terms, than in other important cities in Venezuela, with readings that vary between 19 \u00b0C and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), with an overall average of 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F). Precipitation is heavy during the rainy season, from April to November, though the city does receive more sunshine than most cities in the Colombian Andes, since the valley is too narrow for fog to accumulate.\nVenezuela is situated in an inter-tropical zone, so that there is very little temperature variance over the course of a year. The same is true in M\u00e9rida\u2014the temperatures recorded in August are normally comparable to those measured under comparable conditions in broad daylight in January.\nOn the other hand, given M\u00e9rida's location in the interior of the country, far from the maritime coasts and the influence of the ocean, and its high altitude, the temperature variance over the course of a day is relatively high. Between day and night a difference of more than 10 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F) can be observed; this difference sometimes reaches more than 20 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F). The maximums are reached during the day, and are usually around 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), but on rare occasions exceed 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). The lower limit of daytime temperatures tends to be around 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Government ==\nM\u00e9rida is the seat of the state and municipal governments, and is also home to the Governor and the Mayor's offices, the state legislature, and the regional offices of the judicial and electoral branches. Important representatives and governors are also taken to this city to meet at an annual voting session. Moreover, 13 of the 15 prefectures of the Libertador Municipality are located within the city.\nNowadays, politics have an important role among the general population, although to a lesser extent than in the larger urban centers, and the most important government positions, including Mayor and Governor, are held by members of the official party, the Fifth Republic Movement.  Because of the great concentration of students, and the importance of the Universidad de Los Andes in local development, the positions of University Director and President of the Student Body of the University of The Andes are also of great importance within the local political scene; the first of these offices is currently filled by an opposition party member. Due to the recent suspension of the elections for President of the University Student Body, the city has seen an intense wave of protests that have left more than a dozen wounded.\nIn the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum, the city of M\u00e9rida voted against the overall trend, as at least 60% of voters opposed the continuation of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's mandate. By contrast, the majority of the rest of the population of the state of M\u00e9rida voted in favor of Ch\u00e1vez.\n\n\n=== City planning ===\n\nBecause of its location on a plateau, in a small valley, covering an area of some 10 to 15 km (6 to 9 mi) in length and between 1 and 3 km (2 mi) wide, the city now lacks additional space for urban development. Though its polygonal area covers some 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi), the city occupies a little over 25 square kilometres (10 sq mi), and the rest consists of less developed zones or areas of uneven terrain, such as mountains or hillsides.\nFor this reason, the city layout is unorganized, oriented only by the traffic axes constructed in decades past. The layout of the city center or \"Old Quarter\" is in the Spanish Colonial style, consisting of eight major avenues running east\u2013west and forty streets running north\u2013south, creating blocks of 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330 feet) per side.\nHistorically, M\u00e9rida has been characterized by less pronounced differences between socio-economic classes and for its high quality of life.  Recent years, however, owing to the economic situation confronting the country, have seen a significant increase in slums in the hills and outskirts of the city.\nThe southeastern part of the city, historically the headquarters of the large Haciendas that produced sugar cane, has for several decades undergone major urban development, consisting principally of single-family dwellings, and has grown almost to the point of joining with the city of Ejido, a bedroom community. Ejido currently extends to within less than 2 km (1 mi) of the border of M\u00e9rida, and the two cities are linked by a large avenue that goes from the neighborhoods of downtown M\u00e9rida to the outskirts of Ejido. At this point, it turns into a highway, running to the city of El Vig\u00eda, thereby uniting M\u00e9rida's metropolitan area.\nDespite the limited space available for development, M\u00e9rida has the largest proportion of green areas per capita in Venezuela, thanks to its many squares and public parks, the one surrounding the river Albarregas being particularly noteworthy. The School of Architecture of the University of the Andes puts into practice diverse proposals for creating areas protected from urban development, thereby reducing the impact of population growth on the environment.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nThere were only two neighborhoods in the city at the beginning of the 20th century. One of them was Casco Central (central quarter), located in the east bank of the plateau; which in turn was divided in various zones, identified according to the name of the local square within. The other neighborhood of the city was by the other side of the Albarregas river, in the west bank. It was known as La Otra Banda (\"the other bank\"). However, as a result of the Oil Boom, immigration and various other reasons, new neighborhoods appeared as years went by. The first to emerge were those near downtown. Then, due to the lack of real estate and in the search of quieter areas, neighborhoods were created far, at the time, from the city center. Some of these old spurs have now become part of the city. The following are the main neighborhoods of the city.\n\nBelensate\nPredominantly a higher-class neighborhood, it contains the largest and most luxurious houses in the city.\nCasco Central\nIt comprises the historic city center. It is the main commercial, cultural, and urban area, containing most  museums, libraries, churches, and retail shopping stores in M\u00e9rida.\nChama\nIt is a residential area for the middle class located in the vicinity of the Chama river. It is the lowest-altitude neighborhood in the city, situated about 200 metres (660 feet) lower than downtown. It will be connected to Casco Central via an aerial cableway planned as part of the M\u00e9rida trolleybus project.\nHumboldt\nIt is a populated neighborhood to the southwest of the city, with increasing commercial development in recent years.\nLa Hechicera\nLocated at the northern end of the city, it contains the scientific and engineering buildings of the ULA, as well as the zoo and the botanical garden.\nLa Parroquia\nThis is the current name of the village formerly known as La Punta. It shares similarities with the Casco Central, with residential and commercial zones intermingled. It contains the second Bol\u00edvar Square in the city, as well as large public high schools and sporting facilities, such as the Metropolitan Stadium and the sport complex Cinco \u00c1guilas Blancas.\nLa Pedregosa\nIt is a long neighborhood located in the valley of La Pedregosa creek. It is mainly a residential zone. Although connected to the city, it is far enough from it that its development has increased in the last decades due to the availability of suitable real estate.\nLos Curos\nThis is a popular neighborhood, almost exclusively residential, though it houses one of the few industrial zones in the city.\nPie del Llano\nSituated in the middle of the city, it surrounds the airport and local branches of a number of government offices, as well as the city Mayor's office. It is a commercial and residential neighborhood with plenty of public parks.\nAvenida 16/Campo de Oro/Santa Juana\nIt is a middle-class neighborhood located in the geographical center of the city. It borders the Tatuy mesa, which houses a number of car dealers and auto shops and, above all, the largest hospital of the city, the IHULA (Instituto Aut\u00f3nomo Hospital Universitario de los Andes)Finally, the municipality is divided (for political purposes) into parishes; thirteen of the municipality's fifteen parishes are within the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDespite being one of the largest cities in the Venezuelan Andes, M\u00e9rida has traditionally been less populated in comparison to other more rapidly growing cities in the country. At the beginning of the 19th century, the city only had about 5,000 inhabitants. The demographic growth saw no major changes until the last three decades of the 20th century, when the population tripled, from 74,000 (according to the 1971 census) to the current estimate of 214,000. The increase in number of inhabitants was mainly due to a recent exodus of farmers moving to the urban centers, a phenomenon seen all over the country. Moreover, the prestige of the University of the Andes transformed M\u00e9rida in one of the leading educational centers nationwide. As a result, the city houses an important student population from all over the country.\nAccording to the last census, performed in 2001, M\u00e9rida's population was of 204,879 inhabitants. This value does not include the population omitted by the survey, which was estimated to be about 6% nationwide. However, M\u00e9rida's metropolitan (greater) area, which includes the neighboring cities of Tabay and Ejido, houses over 300,000 inhabitants.\nIn 2006, assuming the usual natural level of growth in the area (between 2.1% and 3% annually), the population reached 230,000 inhabitants, while the metropolitan area would have reached 350,000, thanks to the high growth rate in the city of Ejido, which is one of the largest of the Andes area.\nOther estimates indicate that the actual population of the city has now reached about 250,000 inhabitants and that the metropolitan area has 350,000 inhabitants.\nThe population of M\u00e9rida is relatively homogeneous. There is, however, a large community of foreigners, resulting from the inter- and intra-continental migratory patterns of past eras. Among these there are significant groups of Italians, Portuguese, and Colombians. According to the 1990 census, a little over 4% of the population\u2013some 7,406 inhabitants\u2013is of foreign origin.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city enjoys the highest quality of life in Venezuela. In the year 2000, thirty-six health centers were located in the metropolitan area of M\u00e9rida, as follows: one type I hospital, one type III hospital, and one type IV hospital, in the city proper, plus 15 urban clinics, four of type III and 11 of type I. The area also has 18 rural clinics, 13 of type II and 5 of type I.\nAs in other respects, the Universidad de Los Andes and its buildings are closely tied to the city; the health care infrastructure consists largely of medical centers belonging to the former, in addition to private health centers. Notable among the public hospitals that offer free services is the Instituto Aut\u00f3nomo Hospital Universitario de Los Andes (IHULA), the largest in the region, as well as two smaller hospitals and a chapter of the Venezuelan Red Cross. The larger private hospitals (commonly referred to as \"clinics\") are the Clinical Hospital of M\u00e9rida, the Clinical Center, the M\u00e9rida Clinic, and the Albarregas Clinic. There are also another dozen smaller clinics.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of M\u00e9rida has one of the lowest poverty indexes in Venezuela. According to the 2001 census, 18.09% of the population lives in poverty; this figure is beaten only by San Crist\u00f3bal (17.05%) and the municipalities of Chacao (8.69%), Baruta (11.22%) and San Antonio de Los Altos (6.13%) in the state of Miranda.The city's economy has been evolving and transforming since the beginning of the 20th century. Traditionally, agriculture formed the most significant part of economic activity in M\u00e9rida, which was the distribution center for agricultural goods in the state. Furthermore, large sugar cane haciendas were located nearby; their income led to the construction of a central sugar refinery in which all of M\u00e9rida's sugar cane was processed. This refinery was eventually abandoned and has now been converted into a museum. With the construction of M\u00e9rida Cable Car, the trans-Andes highway, and the city's airport, the city's economy evolved, with the tertiary services sector\u2014especially tourism\u2014displacing the primary agricultural sector.\nTourism, dubbed the \"green industry\", is the principal source of income in the city, and one of the most flourishing industries. Touristic activity benefits from the potential offered by the Andes mountains surrounding the city, and from the city's own parks, museums, and plazas, among other features. In addition, in recent years, owing to the creation of the only free cultural, scientific, and technological zone in the country, the city has begun to develop in the field of technology, thanks also to the support of the university in this matter.\nThe city of M\u00e9rida now stands out at the national level for its low cost of living and its high (relative to cost of living) per capita income of $4,381, ninth among Venezuelan cities. The service sector contributes a large percentage of the state's income. In M\u00e9rida 82,537 people are economically active, of whom 6.67% are unemployed.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nDuring the colonial era and long after independence, the city was isolated from other parts of the country because of the lack of transportation routes to the outside world. Midway through the 19th century, the first highway was built, linking the city with the rest of the country, thereby facilitating access and vehicular traffic. After this point other routes were planned, but lack of maintenance and the nature of the terrain have caused significant interruptions in land traffic between M\u00e9rida and the rest of the country.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nThe city had one national airport, Alberto Carnevalli Airport, which is embedded in the center of the city, and once offered connections to the principal cities of the western Venezuela, such as Maracaibo and Caracas. Furthermore, this airport was one of the most active in the country, with more than 20 daily flights to and from Caracas alone. The airport was closed down however in 2009 due to the many accidents that occurred because of its difficult position within the Andes. As of 2015, Avior Airlines offers flights to Caracas. Other nearby airports, such as Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonso International Airport in El Vig\u00eda, now serve M\u00e9rida.\nThe airport was built in 1956, on the former grounds of a slaughterhouse. Commercial air service was provided by two airlines. There is also an area for private aviation, which receives various types of private flights as well as air ambulance flights, and the delivery of parcels and other valuables.\n\n\n=== Road network ===\nM\u00e9rida has four large internal roadways, which run from one end of the city to the other, and five smaller roadways. The largest is the combination of the Andr\u00e9s Bello and Urdaneta avenues. With a length of more than 8 km (5 mi), it runs from the neighborhoods of the central quarter of M\u00e9rida to the outskirts of Ejido. The other three correspond to Las Am\u00e9ricas and Alberto Carnevali avenues; 16 de septiembre and Tulio Febres Cordero avenues; and the corridor of Los Pr\u00f3ceres avenue.\nTwo national highways connect M\u00e9rida with other cities in Venezuela. The first is Troncal 7 or the Trans-Andes Highway, which runs to the city of Valera. This highway crosses the Andes by way of the valley of the Chama River, and, arriving at the region of Apartaderos, is crossed by Local 1. Finally, following the course of the Santo Domingo River, it arrives at the city of Barinas. The other national highway is the so-called Carretera La Variante. Upon arriving at the Estanques region it becomes Local 8 or Autopista Rafael Caldera. La Variante connects M\u00e9rida with El Vig\u00eda, and in turn, with the Pan-American Highway, thereby giving the city a connection with Colombia and with other important destinations, such as San Crist\u00f3bal and Maracaibo.\nIn addition to the national highways, three alternative routes exit the city of M\u00e9rida. The first, called the V\u00eda del Valle (Valley Road) links the city with the north, to various communities in the valley of the Culata, in the municipality of Santos Marquina. The second is an alternative route to the city of Ejido and other communities such as Jaj\u00ed and La Azulita; it is also a tourism route, with various lookout points facing M\u00e9rida in its initial section. A third minor route, used exclusively by rural vehicles, connects the city with the community of Los Nevados and with the Sierra Nevada National Park.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nAlong with a trolleybus rapid-transit system (still under construction and not fully open), the city relies on a vast system of urban and interurban bus routes which connect the city with its metropolitan area. The conventional bus routes traverse the various avenues of the city and cover a large percentage of the city's area. M\u00e9rida has one of Venezuela's best public transit systems; nevertheless, the system has become overwhelmed by increasing demand, and may be beginning to collapse. Among the existing routes, the route from the center of the city of Ejido to the center of the city of M\u00e9rida stands out, with a volume of thousands of passengers daily.\nThe bus routes are serviced by private companies, the majority of which are cooperatives or driver's associations, following the private model practiced in most of the cities in Venezuela. However, the prices charged are regulated by the city and supervised by the municipal organization for metropolitan transport. As is the practice throughout the country, the public transport system has special fares for senior citizens, and a student pass providing some of the lowest costs in the country.\nAfter years of study, the construction of a non-polluting mass transit system was proposed; the trolleybus was chosen as the most appropriate means of transport. Construction of the M\u00e9rida trolleybus system started near the end of the 1990s. The first line was inaugurated on June 18, 2007, with 15 of 34 proposed stations completed. This route serves Ejido and M\u00e9rida. The second line is in the planning stages and is expected to be 12 km (7 mi) long with 3 common stations alongside or crossing route 1. Route 3, an aerial cableway (originally planned to be a funicular), is a  3 km (2 mi) long route that will connect the community of Chama to a M\u00e9rida trolleybus station; construction has yet to begin. Once construction is completed, M\u00e9rida will be the first city in Latin America with under 500,000 inhabitants to have a rapid-transit system. The existing bus lines will be reorganized into 47 or so feeder routes, in order to provide better public transit to less-serviced areas.\n\n\n=== Regional transport ===\nThe only regional public transit available in M\u00e9rida is by bus. These depart from the city bus station. In addition, there are other private terminals from which private lines depart. From the central station one can take buses to destinations within the state, the region, and the rest of the country. Some of the most heavily used routes in the country start from this station, in particular, those that link M\u00e9rida with the city of Caracas. Though Venezuela is undertaking the construction of a national railway system, the IAFE, in order to link together the country, the city of M\u00e9rida is not projected to be a stop on this system: the nearest stop will be the city of El Vig\u00eda, some 60 km (37 mi) away.\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\nM\u00e9rida contains numerous historical squares, colonial houses, churches, and government buildings that make up most of its sightseeing spots. Moreover, the educational development of the city due, for the most part, to its university (ULA) has contributed to the creation of museums, libraries, and centers for scientific research, such as the Center for Astronomy Research (CIDA), located a few kilometers from the city in the mountains near Apartaderos.\n\n\n=== Monuments, public buildings, and historic places ===\nHouse of Former Governors\nThis colonial-style villa, located in the central quarter, was the official residence of the state governors.\nRectorate's Building\nSeat of the university's rectorate and Aula Magna.\nGovernment Palace\nThe government building, regional executive branch.\nPlaza Monumental Rom\u00e1n Eduardo Sandia\nThe Bullfighting Arena of M\u00e9rida was built in 1967. It has a capacity of 16,000 people and it is frequently used for cultural activities, besides serving its original purpose of bullfighting arena during the Sun Fairs.\nCable Car\nThe M\u00e9rida Cable Car is one of the main touristic spots. In its trajectory, it ascends from the central quarter to the Sierra Nevada. Currently, it holds two world records: one for being the longest cable car system in the world (12.5 km or 7.8 mi) and another one for being the highest cable car system in the world (4,367 m or 14,327 ft). The cable car was completed in 1958. It was closed in 2008 for construction of a new cable car system. It was reopened in April 2016.\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nM\u00e9rida has about two dozen religious buildings dedicated to Christianity, the most important of which are Catholic churches and chapels, since it is the religion with most number of followers in Venezuela.\n\nCathedral of M\u00e9rida\nThe city's Minor Basilica, built in Baroque style, similar to the Cathedral of Toledo, Spain. It is the main Catholic building in the city, where the Archbishop of M\u00e9rida presides the mass services.\nIglesia del Carmen\nThe oldest religious structure in M\u00e9rida, Our Lady of Carmen Church stands close to the Plaza Bol\u00edvar. Visitors marvel at its colonial architecture and its historical significance \u2013 the church is a seat of the Carmelite Brotherhood. It served as cathedral of the city between 1812 and 1866, before the current one was built.\nIglesia de la Tercera\nIglesia del Llano\nM\u00e9rida's only building in the Gothic style. It stands near the place where an old chapel held the first wooden cross brought to M\u00e9rida by the Spaniards.\nIglesia de Milla\nThis is one of the oldest churches in the city, originally built in the 18th century and rebuilt in 1907 after an earthquake. It is located in front of the square with the same name.\nArchbishop's Palace\nA Baroque palace located in front of Bol\u00edvar Square. It has served as the residence for the Archbishop since 1951. It houses the Archdiocesan Museum.\n\n\n=== Parks, squares, and sightseeing ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is famous nationwide for its great number of parks and squares, providing its inhabitants with access to nature. There are, at least, a dozen squares and two dozen parks, some of which are described below.\n\nBoulevard de los Pintores (Painters' Boulevard)\nOn this street painters congregate in order to create, exhibit, and sell their works.\nAquarium Garden\nThis aquarium exhibits both fresh and salt water fish. It also has collections relating to M\u00e9rida's rural past.\nBeethoven Park\nLocated in front of the Museum of Modern Art in the northern area of the city, this pretty park has a clock on the ground, whose numbers are flowerpots, and large mechanical carillon clock with wooden elves that play melodies from the famous German composer.\nM\u00e9rida Botanical Garden\nThis was the first botanical garden in the city. It is located in the extreme north of the city and has about 40 hectares under cultivation.\nParque Domingo Pe\u00f1a\nAlso called Paseo de la Feria or Parque de los Conquistadores, consists of an avenue with a lookout point facing the Sierra Nevada. Student celebrations and get-togethers often take place here.\nParque Metropolitano Albarregas\nThis park is the largest in the city, 22 km (14 mi) long and 612 hectares in area. It is located on the bank of the Albarregas River, and contains play areas for children and a sculpture museum.\nParque Ciudad de los Ni\u00f1os (Children's City Park)\nA large children's park, which models the shape of the city on a smaller scale.\nParque de las Cinco Rep\u00fablicas (Park of the Five Republics)\nA park that is the home of the Bol\u00edvar Column, a monument dedicated to Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. This was the first sculpture constructed to honor Bol\u00edvar, in 1842. It was commissioned by the then-governor of the province, Gabriel Pic\u00f3n. It was erected to commemorate the moving of Bol\u00edvar's remains to the Pante\u00f3n Nacional in Caracas, from their previous resting place in the city of Santa Marta, Colombia, where Bol\u00edvar had been buried following his death in 1830. The monument consists of a pillar on which sits Bol\u00edvar's face in bronze.\nParque del Ej\u00e9rcito (Park of the Army)\nA small park, located in the south of the city, commemorating Venezuela's army. It has green areas, a fountain, and models of military tanks.\nParque La Isla (Island Park)\nSituated in the former location of a coffee plantation of the same name, the park was built in 1960 partly as an underwater park, and is 3.5 hectares in area. Its infrastructure is reminiscent to that of an island, offering kids play grounds, trails, and athletic courts. The park houses the largest convention center in the city, as well as the headquarters of Corpoandes (a government-run corporation that promotes development in the Andes region), facilities for cultivating orchids, and a museum dedicated to beekeeping.\nParque Las tres M\u00e9ridas (Three M\u00e9ridas Park)\nA small park that commemorates the three cities in the world named M\u00e9rida (in Spain, Mexico, and Venezuela). It features architectural elements typical of each city.\nParque Zool\u00f3gico los Chorros de Milla\nA small zoo situated in the extreme north of the city where the Milla waterfalls once flowed, it contains species indigenous to Venezuela and the Andes region.\nParque la Marina (Park of the Navy)\nLocated in Belensate, it has a large water pool surrounding a submarine fin, an underwater clock, and a children's play area in the shape of a boat.\nParque Tibisay\nThis park is dedicated to Tibisay, princess of the original dwellers of the region, the tribe Mucuj\u00fan.  According to legend, she still laments the death of her fianc\u00e9 Chief Murach\u00ed, who died bravely fighting the Spanish conquistadors. This park is located at the north end of Urdaneta avenue.\nPlaza Bel\u00e9n\nA small plaza, located to the northeast of the city center, in a neighbourhood of the same name. Its design, like that of most of the other plazas described here, follows the prototypical Spanish colonial style.\nPlaza Bol\u00edvar\nThe past and present main square of M\u00e9rida, it is surrounded by the most important public and historical buildings of the city. It has an equestrian statue of Bolivar.\nPlaza Glorias Patrias\nConsists of twin plazas constructed in honor of the independence leaders Vicente Campo El\u00edas and Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez.\nPlaza Las Hero\u00ednas (Plaza of the Heroines)\nA plaza constructed to honor five women from M\u00e9rida who fought for independence. It is surrounded by various markets and artisans shops, and the first Cable Car station.\nPlaza de Milla\nThe actual name of this square is Plaza Sucre. It is located in front the Iglesia de Milla and near the army headquarters, northeast of the city center. It is dedicated to the independence hero Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, and it is frequently visited by locals and tourists alike, due to its convenient location among hotels, pensions, restaurants, stores, and ice cream parlors.\n\n\n== Gallery Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is a student city with a large percentage of its population found in classrooms, especially in the university area, where 20\u201330% of the population consists of students, and has a 0% illiteracy rate. It is the home of the University of the Andes, one of the most respected universities in the country, and the second to oldest. M\u00e9rida also contains various institutions of higher educations such as universities, university centers, polytechnic institutes, and university colleges, among others.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nThe University of the Andes, the most important in the city, was established in 1785, and offers undergraduate programs in art, sciences, literature, and humanities, long and short programs, as well as courses, degrees, post-graduate programs, specializations, diplomas, etc., bringing together more than 40,000 students and 6,000 professors. The university operates two campuses in M\u00e9rida, and about a dozen faculties spread throughout the city.\nTwo other more recently founded universities are based in M\u00e9rida: the Universidad Nacional Abierta (UNA), which offers undergraduate distance-learning courses; and, from 2006, the UNEFA, which is a military university specializing in Engineering for undergraduates.  The main university centers to be found in the city are given below:\n\nUniversity of the Andes (ULA)\nUniversidad Nacional Abierta (UNA)\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de las Fuerzas Armadas (UNEFA)\nSantiago Mari\u00f1o Polytechnic Institute (IUPSM)\nColegio Universitario Hotel Escuela de Los Andes Venezolanos (CUHELAV)\nSantiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida Institute (ISCM)\nAntonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre University Institute\nCrist\u00f3bal Mendoza Technological University Institute\nLa Frontera Technological Institute (IUFRONT)Primary and Secondary EducationThere are many institutions dedicated to primary and secondary education, most of which are public, under the control of the national or regional governments.  Of particular note is the Liceo Libertador. The largest education centers in the city can be found among the many private Catholic schools.  Colegio La Salle de M\u00e9rida and Colegio San Luis are among the largest with several hundred pupils each.  These are run by governing bodies Fundaci\u00f3n La Salle and Fundaci\u00f3n Don Bosco, respectively.  However, all schools come ultimately under the auspices of The Venezuelan Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n.\nOther educational institutions worth mentioning are the schools dedicated to languages, sport and music. M\u00e9rida is known as a destination to learn Spanish. In 2007 Jakera Spanish School was voted by the Language industry (STAR awards) as one of the top four Spanish schools worldwide. There are important conservatories, orchestras and choirs based in the city.  Most are linked to the universities and specialize in many kinds of instruments, as well as lyrical interpretation and the development of the singing voice. Amongst the language schools, of predominance are those that teach English, though French and Italian schools can also be found.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nThe greatest network of libraries is that of the University of the Andes. Each school has a specialized library, as well as the multidisciplinary libraries located in La Hechicera, the sports division, the administrative division, and a number of other smaller libraries, adding up to more than a dozen under the direction of Serbiula. Moreover, ULA owns the largest digital archive of the country, available to the public for research and education.\nBesides the university libraries, M\u00e9rida has the Biblioteca Bolivariana (Bolivarian Library), which is also an area of exhibits and historical displays, a branch of the National Library of Venezuela, and the public library Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, subsidized by the government. Other public and private institutions such as schools, churches, and language institutes have their own minor libraries to be used by their members.\nAdditionally, land originally set aside for a metropolitan library in 2006 was reallocated for the use of National Experimental University of the Armed Forces, and a new site for the proposed library has yet to be granted.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe city's culture closely resembles that of Andean Folklore and is in fact the main, if not defining, example of this folklore. Inhabitants of M\u00e9rida, with deep connections to their culture, are characterized by their well-preserved traditions and slow, unhurried way of life. The city itself can be recognized by its many well-preserved  colonial parks and buildings, in addition to its famous social scene, the local art and craftwork, and the unique regional cuisine.\n\n\n=== Museums, cultural centers, and theaters ===\nArchaeological Museum\nArchdiocesan Museum\nMuseum of Science and Technology\nMuseum of Colonial Art\nMuseum of Modern Art\nJuan F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez House of Culture\nTulio Febres Cordero Cultural Center\nC\u00e9sar Renginfo TheaterNot many know that the Archdiocesan Museum of M\u00e9rida houses the second and third oldest bells in the world, the so-called Ave Mar\u00eda bell from the year 909 and San Pedro of 912.\n\n\n=== Festivals and local customs ===\nIn addition to national holidays and events, several festivals take place and have origins in M\u00e9rida. Most are religious celebrations, and a few \u2013 such as the city's famous \"Feria del Sol\" or \"Sun Fair\" that takes place in the beginning of February \u2013 are of an international scale.\nFor M\u00e9rida, the most important and famous religious traditions are those celebrated by the city's Christian devotees during Christmas and Holy Week. These festivities include La Quema del A\u00f1o Viejo (Burning of the Past Year), La Pasi\u00f3n Viviente de Cristo (Christ's Living Passion) and La Paradura del Ni\u00f1o (Christ Child's Standing) celebrated with prayers, song, fireworks, wine and cake.\nAnother of the more popular local customs (those without official government sanction) are the Caravanas Estudiantiles, student processionals organized by and for high school or university graduates upon earning their degree. In recent years, this tradition has been extended to include younger students who have completed their primary or elementary education. Such celebrations usually occur during the first days of June for high school graduates, and throughout nearly the entire year for college graduates. Similar festivities can be found in other parts of the country, but the Caravanas of M\u00e9rida have a special relevance and importance given the city's large student population.\nOther customs firmly rooted in the M\u00e9ridan tradition, usually associated with fixed dates, include Patinatas Navide\u00f1as or \"Christmas skating\", which occurs in the city streets throughout the month of December; the Fiesta de las Velas on December 7 when in the evening all the electricity is turned off and some 18,000 candles are lit; the Fiesta de San Benito between January 12 and 31 celebrated with a drummers processions and street dancing; or the Vasallos de la Candelaria, another typical festivity with children and street dancing.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe cuisine of the M\u00e9rida region differs notably from that of the rest of the nation. Among the most notable differences is the arepa andina (Andean Arepa), a variant of the traditional Venezuelan arepa made from  wheat flour instead of the more common corn. This difference in ingredients is due primarily to the fact that the Andean region was one of the few places in the country where wheat historically has been harvested. Another notable dish is the pizca andina, common to M\u00e9rida, T\u00e1chira and the Colombian Andes, a soup with potato, milk, long onion, and parsley. Other important dishes are prepared with trout, the only fish found in the region.\nThe city's typical brightened sweets, made from a base of milk and other ingredients, are also notable. There is a historical tradition of such sweets, which are said to originate in the convents where they were prepared in the 19th century. Also, one can find alfajores, aliados, and almojabanas. Popular drinks include corn liquor, mistella, and \"donkey's milk\", which is known as \"Andean punch.\"\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe traditional music of the city is marked by waltz rhythms. It also includes regional or national rhythms, such as pasillos,  a type of merengue and bambucos. The music of M\u00e9rida, like its people, is recognizable by the laid back rhythms. The use of the violin and mandolin are almost mandatory in the music style.  Additionally, the city is commonly the birthplace of many rock and punk bands, among other genres. The city is also home to the M\u00e9rida State Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n== Entertainment and tourism ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is the quintessential touristic city in Venezuela, being one of the most sought-after destinations by national and international travelers.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\nLodging accommodations can be found to fit all budgets, including pensions and apartments for tourists with basic amenities. At least half of the hotels are located within the city, which is about 35% of the total number statewide.  All in all, there are about 2,650 beds available. Moreover, there will be three large five-star hotels added before 2007, when M\u00e9rida becomes the host of the soccer event Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\n\n=== Shops ===\nThe main commercial area of M\u00e9rida lies within the historic downtown. However, all kinds of services can be found in the suburbs. Two notable destinations by locals and tourists alike are M\u00e9rida's Mercado Principal (Main Market) and the Helader\u00eda Coromoto (Coromoto Ice cream Parlor). The Mercado Principal is famous for its variety of folk art, gastronomy, produce, groceries, and other local and regional goods. Helader\u00eda Coromoto is well known because it offers the greatest variety of ice cream flavors worldwide, with more than 800 choices.\n\n\n=== Shopping malls ===\nFor those who like to go shopping and spend the day enjoying stores or food courts, M\u00e9rida offers the following shopping malls: Las Tapias and Millenium located in Andr\u00e9s Bello Avenue; Alto Prado and Pie de Monte located in Los Pr\u00f3ceres Avenue; and Rodeo Plaza located in Las Am\u00e9ricas Avenue.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nAs a city with many students and tourists, M\u00e9rida enjoys a broad network of places open at night, mostly composed of clubs and bars. There are also various caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and two movie theaters. Furthermore, a number of cultural events constantly take place in these locations. Notable among these events are the concerts of the Symphonic Orchestra of M\u00e9rida, as well as concerts by local bands. Many of the night-clubs and discos open until late at night, with a few of them staying open until sunrise.\n\n\n== Media and communication ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThere are three television stations which broadcast from M\u00e9rida. Two of these are general-interest stations, airing programs including news, entertainment, and culture. The third is an institutional and educational channel and belongs to the Universidad de Los Andes.\nThe stations are:\n\nTelevisora Andina de M\u00e9rida, (TAM)\nULATV\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nThe principal radio stations of the state also broadcast from M\u00e9rida. These stations are mostly privately owned, though in recent years some public community radio stations have emerged.\n\n\n=== Press ===\nSome of the best-known newspapers from M\u00e9rida are:\n\nEl Correo de Los Andes\nCambio de Siglo [2]\nDiario Frontera [3]\nDiario Pico Bol\u00edvar [4]\nCultura Tatuy\n\n\n== Sports ==\nM\u00e9rida has a strong athletic infrastructure; noteworthy among others is the Guillermo Soto Rosa Stadium, an important soccer facility and the old headquarters of the local soccer team. During the last month of 2005, the city was host to the 2005 Andean National Games, an event for which numerous athletic facilities were built, including the Cinco \u00c1guilas Blancas (Five White Eagles) Sports Complex\u2014a 42 000-seat stadium and the current home stadium of the local team, Estudiantes de M\u00e9rida F. C.. Soccer is the most popular and widely supported sport, but given the city's location, a variety of extreme sports are also practiced as well.\nIn addition to the aforementioned soccer, the current athletic infrastructure also supports a wide array of other traditional sports, including tennis, basketball, baseball, and Venezuelan sports such as bolas criollas.\nThe Metropolitan Stadium of M\u00e9rida, dedicated on May 25, 2007 with a friendly match between Venezuela and Honduras, was host to the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\n\n== See also ==\nM\u00e9rida (state)\nLibertador Municipality, M\u00e9rida\n\n\n== References ==\nSecondary literature(in Spanish) Historia de M\u00e9rida, Carlos Chalbaud Zerpa, Universidad de Los Andes. 1985, M\u00e9rida, Venezuela.\n(in Spanish) Enciclopedia de Venezuela.

          "We went on Saturday. It was busy with families who crowded around the entry to the cenote making it difficult to get into the water. They have changing rooms but only one had a lock. There wasn\u2019t a hook or a bench so the muddy floor was the only option to put things while",
          "A small beautiful cenote with crystal clear blue, refreshing water and a nice backdrop. Worth getting there early before the crowds start to arrive. Plenty of small fish willing to give you a pedicure as well.",
          "Wow, we loved this place. May have been something to do that we had the place all to ourselves. We arrived around 1p after we left Merida and were driving down to Campeche. Water temp in early December was so refreshing and the water crystal clear!! It is definitely worth it to",
          "We weren\u2019t sure if any cenotes would be open in January 1, and didn\u2019t find any info online or any phone numbers listed, so we took a chance and drove out there. Glad we did. This place is lovely. A tad crowded but the water still clean and cool and wonderful. It would have been",
          "There are two cenotes, they\u2019re pretty small but totally worth ti, just getting there is a beautiful narrow road.",

          "If you go to visit the Uxmal ruins and you need some refreshment, then go X Batun and enjoy it! It is an open type cenote. It is quite nice but we were unlucky and met a big group of noisy people so we couldn't enjoy it as we wished. We went by car using google map, so no",
          "It\u2019s pretty but not much space to swim. It might be dry season so the water is low, but very limited swimming area. There\u2019s a sectioned off area for aquatic plants, which is good because those filter and clean a body of water, however there were 100s of flies swarming the",
          "This was a great find, even as it was quite difficult to find! The cenote was fairly large, with cool crystalline waters that provided a wonderful break from the nearly 90-degree temperatures of the day. It's fairly easy of access--a short dirt path leads from the parking area",
          "Our only mistake was going on a Sunday...very crowded. And with so many people in the water it became cloudy. On a previous visit we had the place to ourselves. But we are only guests here and enjoyed watching the local families having fun. It is difficult to find this cenote.",
          "Great stop after a few hours of Uxmal (which is enough of Puuc for 1 day) I shouldn't write a review actually because this cenote was so quiet and idyllic I'm afraid more tourists might ruin that We even got an iguana angry for invading its territory (ie. the cenote) Water is",

          "This cenote is really one of the most beautiful one. The problem is many people knows that so its very crowded. You should go either early in the morning or later in the afternoon when the buses still not there or are going. You can swim and snorkel and the price is good for the",

          "We went to this cenote as we travelled to Cancun from Merida. It is off the main road, but not too far out of the way. The pool was fantastic with the vines/roots hanging down and the water blue and clean. It has a minimal charge for entry and although we did not swim, it",

          "If you are looking for a natural atraction in a very spectacular nature environment, this is your option. This cenote remains natural in his original status, you will find very old tree roots, amazing rocks that will tell you about the thousand of years of history ans swim with",
          "You would really want to go there on a weekday or early in the day as it is not very big, though it is stunning. The toilets are a disaster, the changing facilities basic and not too clean, but for 50 pesos entry you can't really complain. Please remember to wear bio-degradable",
          "These two cenotes are very beautiful and refreshing after a hot day at Uxmal. Well worth the trek off the highway down the one way road towards Cacao. They are well cared for with good facilities.",
          "This is by far the best cenote for color, temperature and all around primitive nuance. Far enough off the main tour route to keep the crowds away, so it's perfect for some quiet time in the water or simply drinking in the beauty.",
          "We went on a Sunday so it did get crowded but wasn't so bad in the morning. There are actually 2 cenotes here, x batun and another that you can visit for the same price.",
          "As someone else noted, the bathrooms are not much to write home about. Otherwise, stunningly beautiful and a lovely place for a swim",
          "Small place of paradise. The bathrooms are not that good so be prepared for that, besides that it's quite a magical place.",
          "We had a great time at X'Butan. We had both cenotes to ourselves as we went on a Monday. The organised tours don't go there as the road is a bit of a track but is fine. There were 4 of us and we hired a car through Mexico Rent A Car. mexicorentacar@hotmail.com It was the best",
          "The place is beautiful and does not have many people at it. The water is not overly deep but very clear and full of water lilies and fish. The downside is that the last 15km of the 42km journey from Merida are very bumpy and slightly small roads to maneuver, however still worth",
          "one of he most beautiful locations and interesting drives you can have. Follow the signs to Cacao, once you take the right turn ad head down the road keep going. The town is small and drive straight through until you get to the palapa on the right that sell tickets to the",
          "My first time to a cenote. This was excellent. I was surprised and beyond belief of the beauty of these under ground caves. That are protected from being modernized. Everyone please go it was a wonderful tour.",
          "First, ignore the map. TripAdvisor currently shows this randomly in the centre of Merida, but as the address makes clear it's actually 49km South of the city. In fact it's only a few miles beyond the Hacienda Yaxcopoil, which makes it half of a good double visit to two less",
          "I don't mean to sound like a cenote snob, really I don't, but we've probably been to about 20 cenotes all over the Yucatan so I think we're good at comparing! I thought that these 2 were very good cenotes - one is an open air cenote and one was a cave cenote. The open air one",
          "Follow the other reviewers' directions to get there by taking the Cacao exit. Both were beautiful cenotes but we liked the cave one best. The outdoor one had very sharp rocks so we wore flip-flops. The water in the middle was too deep for anything but treading water and the",
          "These cenotes are a ways off the highway, but worth the drive if you are passing by. These are the only cenotes I've visited, but reading about some of the other more popular ones, I can see why these get good reviews. I am not a good swimmer, so I appreciate the gradual entry",
          "Treat yourself to Cenotes...Underwater caves scattered all over the Yucatan. Cristal clear waters in a peaceful ambiance",
          "We had never been to a cenote before and we were totally amazed by the beauty of this one. We sat in the cenote for ages and just \"reflected\" on life. It was so relaxing and what an amazing place to see",

          "My sons and I really enjoyed this cool cenote not far from Merida. The drive is not bad and it is not TOO hard to get to. It is not overly large, so it could get a bit crowded if there are more than a few visitors. Luckily, we had it to ourselves for a while and only a few other",
          "Amazing place to swim and snorkel. Price includes entrances to two cenotes. Relaxing and beautiful!! Really fun place to visit! I recommend before you go take a very looked up map of the location as it is tricky to get there. You go through an isolated town... but don't worry",
          "This was on our tour of several cenotes and haciendas. Great place tp swim, but the fish are a little 'nibbly'",
          "Very neat to see if you haven't! Lot of steps down to water and back. Water is very cool. Locker and changing rooms very nice.",
          "Our family of five (all 3 kids under 10) enjoyed this visit a lot. It's only about 35 minutes from Merida by car. The price (P$50/person) compares itself well to other cenotes and there are actually two of them. As others said, the small cenotes are in a beautiful wild setting.",
          "Cenote with very clear turquoise water, waterlelies, very accessible even for young children and not too deep. Beautiful fishes. Can be a little crowded if many people come at the same time but wait a little bit longer under the shade of the trees and you will have this place",
          "This cenote is a trek to get to but well worth the drive! An open air cenote makes for beautiful pictures of the pristine water and flora. If you have access to a car and are up for an adventure this trip is highly recommended! Look for the exit off of highway 261 that says",
          "We loved this open air cenote. The water is beautiful and the surroundings are gorgeous. Highly recommend a trip here. Entry is $50 per person. Kids are free. There are changing rooms at the cenote. Bike rentals are available for a 5km ride.",
          "When you come into town on the right is a complex with a large sign that you must stop at to pay,50p per person, continue on through the small town, turn right at the store and stop at the gate to give the man your tickets. Down a dirt road, and when we were there, through",
          "We booked a bike tour through Carnival Cruise Lines to do while in Progresso. My suggestion is to definitely book something... there is not a lot to do at this stop. We traveled about one hour by van to the bike location where we were given a bike and a helmet. The biking was",
          "There are heaps of cenotes about an hour out of Merida and they are far more interesting than things currently rated above it here! Take a tour if you must or grab a 22 peso bus out to Homun where you can bargain with a mototaxi guy to take you around to any of the numerous"

The outside cenote is also nice, some small biting fish though. I didnt stay as long as it was pretty crowded for a small space and not much room to chill. I couldn\u2019t see the restaurants mentioned.",
          "When I visited it, it was nice just for a picture but the water was cloudy and a wee stinky.\nThe other cenote was great for bathing. \nSadly the area is littered, a problem that could be easily solved by the staff since they were busy killing time by playing with their phones.",
          "A great place to chill down and swim. The water is clear and deep. I could rent life preserver. It is possible to jump in to it. The entrance fee is still less expensive. You have shower and locker to. Next to the Cenote is restaurant with a small menu."

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo. Next to the Municipal Palace in the Plaza Grande.\nCasa de la Cultura del Mayab, the Casa de Artesan\u00edas (house of handcrafts) resides there.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.  It joins M\u00e9rida with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Valladolid and ultimately Canc\u00fan.\nM\u00e9rida-Tizim\u00edn (Federal 176) connects M\u00e9rida with Tizim\u00edn (2nd. largest city in Yucat\u00e1n).\nM\u00e9rida-Teabo-Peto known as Mundo Maya Road Carretera del Mundo Maya, its utilized in both \"convent route\" Ruta de los Conventos, and linking the ancient maya city of Mayap\u00e1n and Chetumal, state capitol of Quintana Roo\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

        "wiki": "Mayapan (M\u00e0ayap\u00e1an in Modern Maya), (in Spanish  Mayap\u00e1n), (pronounced m\u012b-\u00e4-\u02c8p\u00e4n) is a Pre-Columbian Maya site a couple of kilometers south of the town of Telchaquillo in Municipality of Tecoh, approximately 40 km south-east of M\u00e9rida and 100 km west of Chichen Itza; in the state of Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico. Mayapan was the political and cultural capital of the Maya in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula during the Late Post-Classic period from the 1220s until the 1440s. Estimates of the total city population are 15,000\u201317,000 people, and the site has more than 4,000 structures within the city walls, and additional dwellings outside.\nThe site has been professionally surveyed and excavated by archeological teams, beginning in 1939; five years of work was done by a team in the 1950s, and additional studies were done in the 1990s. Since 2000, a collaborative Mexican-United States team has been conducting excavations and recovery at the site, which continue.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nMayapan is 4.2 square kilometers (about 1.6 square miles) and has over 4000 structures, most of them residences, packed into this compound within the city walls. Built-up areas extend a half kilometer beyond the city walls in all directions. The stone perimeter wall has twelve gates, including seven major gates with vaulted entrances. The wall is 9.1 km (about 5.65 miles) long and is roughly ovate with a pointed northeast corner.\nThe ceremonial center of the site is located in Square Q of the city's grid in the center of the wider western half of the walled enclosure. The ceremonial center has a tightly packed cluster of temples, colonnaded halls, oratories, shrines, sanctuaries, altars, and platforms (for oration, dancing, or stela display). A.L. Smith, an archeologist with the Carnegie Institute, estimated 10\u201312,000 people lived within the walled city.\n\nAccording to Dr. Gregory Simons survey outside the city walls, there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000\u201317,000 people. His survey results are posted online at www.mayapanperiphery.net. People living outside of the city wall engaged in agriculture, animal-raising, and specialized activities such as lime production. Russell also found a colonnaded hall outside the city wall, revealing much is still to be discovered regarding the complexity of this urban landscape.\nThe Temple of Kukulcan, a large pyramid also known as the Castillo, is the main temple in Mayapan. It is located immediately to the east of the Cenote Ch'en Mul, which has caves radiating from it. In form, the Temple of Kukulcan (Structure Q-162 on the site map) is a radial four-staircase temple with nine terraces; it is generally similar to the Temple of Kukulcan at the earlier site of Chichen Itza. However, the Mayapan temple appears to be an inferior imitation of the one at Chichen Itza, and the city's buildings in general are not constructed as well as those in other Mayan cities. For example, most or all of the vaulted roofs in Mayapan have collapsed, while many of the better-built buildings at Chichen Itza remain intact. Other major temples in the ceremonial center include three round ones, which are unusual for the Maya area and are also linked to the deity Kukulkan/Quetzalcoatl in his wind god (Ehecatl) aspect. Unlike Chichen Itza, Mayapan has no ballcourts.\nThe extensive residential zones of the site are composed of dwellings and ancillary domestic structures, with those around the ceremonial district larger and of higher quality and those toward the fringes being generally poorer. The houses are often arranged in small patio groups surrounding small courtyards. Houses were built haphazardly without organized streets. Lanes wind among the residences and walls.  The residential areas of the site contain many cenotes, perhaps as many as 40. Settlement was the most dense in the southwestern part of the city where cenotes are more numerous.\n\n\n== Historical overview ==\n\nThe ethnohistorical sources \u2013 such as Diego de Landa's Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan, compiled from native sources in the 16th century \u2013 recount that the site was founded by Kukulcan (the Mayan name of Quetzalcoatl, the Toltec king, culture hero, and demigod) after the fall of Chichen Itza. He convened the lords of the region, who agreed to found a new capital at Mayapan. The lords divided the towns of Yucat\u00e1n among them, and chose the chief of the Cocom family as their leader.\nThe ethnohistorical sources recount multiple different histories of the rise and fall of Mayapan (Roys 1962). These histories are often confusing, chronologically implausible, and difficult to reconcile. For example, some sources say that the Maya revolted in 1221 against the Maya-Toltec lords of Chichen Itza. After a short civil war, the lords of various powerful cities and families met to restore a central government to Yucat\u00e1n. They decided to build a new capital city near the town of Telchaquillo, hometown of Hunac Ceel, the general who defeated the rulers of Chichen Itza. The new city was built within a defensive wall and named Mayapan, meaning \"Standard of the Maya people\".\nThe chief of the Cocom family, a rich and ancient lineage that had taken part in the revolt against Chichen, was chosen to be king, and all the other noble families and regional lords were to send members of their families to Mayapan to play parts in the government (and perhaps act as hostages for the good behavior of the subsidiary cities). Mexican mercenaries from Tabasco were also employed to keep order and maintain power.  Another family, the Xiu, may have been living in the Mayapan area prior to the arrival of the Cocom; the Xiu claim to be a part of the lineage from Uxmal. This arrangement lasted for over 200 years. (An alternative account is given in a Maya chronicle from the Colonial era, claiming that Mayapan was contemporary with Chichen Itza and Uxmal and allied with those cities, but archeological evidence shows this version to be less likely.)\nMayapan became the primary city in a group of allies that included much of the northern Yucat\u00e1n, and trade partners that extended directly to Honduras, Belize, and the Caribbean island of Cozumel, and indirectly to Mexico.  Though Mayapan was ruled by a council, the Jalach winik and the aj k\u2019in (the highest ruler, and the high priest) dominated the political sphere. Below the two primary officials were many other officials with varying responsibilities. The range of classes went from the nobility, down to slaves, with intermediary classes in between. The social climate of Mayapan was made complicated by the antagonistic relationship between the factions of nobles, which were often arranged by kinship (Pugh 2009; Milbrath 2003). In 1441, Ah Xupan of the powerful noble family of Xiu became resentful of the political machinations of the Cocom rulers and organized a revolt. As a result, all of the Cocom family, except one who was away in Honduras conducting trade, were killed, Mayapan was sacked, burned, and abandoned, all the larger cities went into decline, and Yucat\u00e1n devolved into warring city-states.\nArchaeological evidence indicates that at least the ceremonial center was burned at the end of the occupation. Excavation has revealed burnt roof beams in several of the major buildings in the site center.\n\n\n== Excavations and investigations ==\n\nIn 1841 John L. Stephens was the first to document parts of the Mayapan site with two important illustrations. The first was of the Q-152 round temple, and the second was of the Pyramid of Kukulkan. He was the first in a long string of explorers who drew the ruins of Mayapan. The first large-scale archeological site surveys were not conducted until 1938 by R.T. Patton. These surveys mapped the main plaza group and the city wall, and were the basis of later maps (Russell 2008).\nIn the 1950s, archaeologists of the Carnegie Institution, including A. L. Smith, Robert Smith, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, Edwin Shook, Karl Ruppert and J. Eric Thompson conducted five years of intensive archeological investigations at Mayapan. Their work was published in a mimeographed series of Current Reports. The Current Reports have recently been republished in their entirety by the University of Colorado Press (John Weeks 2009). The final report was published by the Carnegie Institution as Mayapan, Yucatan, Mexico, by H. E. D. Pollock, Ralph L. Roys, A. L. Smith, and Tatiana Proskouriakoff (1962, Publication 619). Robert Smith published a two-volume monograph on The Pottery of Mayapan in 1971 (Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology 66, Harvard University).\nIn the early 1990s, Clifford T. Brown of Tulane University carried out excavations in the residential zones of Mayapan as part of his doctoral dissertation research. Several years later, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) of Mexico began extensive architectural excavations and consolidation under the direction of archaeologist Carlos Peraza Lope. This work continues to the present. It has resulted in the discovery of many important artifacts, murals, stuccoes, and architectural elements.\nFrom 2001 to 2009, further investigations were begun at the site by a team under the direction of Dr. Marilyn Masson from the State University New York at Albany, Carlos Peraza Lope of INAH, and Timothy S. Hare of Morehead State University. This \"Economic Foundations of Mayapan\" (PEMY) Project performed mapping, surface survey and collection, test-pitting, and horizontal excavation across the city. Major findings of this project include the identification of diverse occupational specialization among the city's commoners, who worked as craftsmen, conscripted military personnel, farmers, and domestic servants. Great variation is now recognized in the types of work performed by commoners of different households and their degrees of affluence. This project has also identified a probable major market plaza in Square K (between the site center and major north gate D); Richard Terry, Bruce Dahlin, and Daniel Bair have analyzed soil samples from this location to test the function of this locality. In 2008 and 2009, the PEMY project focused excavations on an outlying ceremonial group by the far eastern city gate (Gate H), known as Itzmal Ch'en, as part of its study of the economic and social links between governing elites and distant neighborhoods within the city.\n\n\n== Chronology ==\n\n\n=== Before Mayapan ===\nSome evidence suggests overlapping occupation of the area by different cultures. Shook in 1954 said that there may have been a Puuc \"city\" somewhere near Mayapan prior to its post-classical settlement. The mixture of Puuc pot sherds in the lower parts of Mayapan lots may support this, but it is a very small percentage of the material (2% in most cases and no more than 4% in others).\n\n\n=== Site chronology based on ceramics ===\nAccording to Robert Smith, the ceramicist for the Carnegie Institution, there were two ceramic phases in Mayapan: hocaba, which he said started around A.D. 1200 and may have included types named Mama Red and Navula Unslipped, more commonly associated with southern lowland settlements. (Milbrath and Pereza argue that the Hocaba phase starts in A.D. 1100, which fits better with the chronology of the southern lowland sites.) The second phase is Tases, which has some overlapping typology with the Hocaba phase.\n\n\n=== Site chronology based on radiocarbon dates ===\n\n\n==== Middle Preclassical Date ====\nIn an alley fill between the Templo Redondo and an adjoining hall, some charcoal was found that yielded a calibrated date of 540\u2013820 B.C. But, most of the pottery in this fill was post-classical. Researchers think that this sample represented old charcoal that predated the context in which it was found.\n\n\n==== Terminal Classical Dates ====\nA burial found on bedrock in the houselot soils of a post-classical solare dated between A.D. 600 and A.D. 780. The burial appeared to be a secondary interment, and could not be completely excavated because it intruded into a wall. There was no pottery with the burial; midden samples in this area suggest occupation prior to the construction of the post-classical houselots.Charcoal was found on the upper floor of one of the temples that was dated to A.D. 770-1020. Researchers think that this sample is not associated with the context in which it was found. The construction fill as well as the upper floors were of post-classical age.\n\n\n=== Early Mayapan occupation ===\nThree separate samples form the frame for early Mayapan occupation. These dates are A.D. 990\u20131170. However, two of these dates come from inexact sources. One was burned copal found in an unknown structure (apparently the label had eroded off of the structure); the researchers inferred that it was Q-95. The early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in Mayapan's early history.\nCarbon dating of the pits below what was assumed to be Q-97 (again the label had eroded) dated from A.D. 990\u20131180.\nCharcoal found in the early construction phase of the site's main pyramid was dated A.D. 1020\u20131170. This sample was found in reliable context and is presumably the most accurate. It is important for suggesting that the post-classical phase in Mayapan started earlier than A.D. 1200.\n\n\n=== Late Mayapan occupation ===\nMayapan's settlement pattern radiated outwards to its fringes over time; many of the later dates are from materials outside of the main group of ruins. The fall of the city is tentatively dated around A.D. 1461, based on the lack of construction of altars and burial cists after this date. (Lope et al. 2006). According to Diego de Landa Calderon (1524 - 1579), the city was abandoned following the country's enslavement by a certain chieftain of the Yucatecan nation (in collusion with a garrison of Mexica Indians), and which abuse eventually led to internecine war, culminating in the city's demise in circa 1441.\n\n\n== Agriculture and animals ==\nMilpa, or mixed, fields may have been cultivated when Mayapan was inhabited. There is evidence that the area around Mayapan was regularly used for slash-and-burn agriculture. Cenotes and underground limestone canals serve as the only source of freshwater in this area, making them essential to support agriculture. Researchers have suggested that Mayapan was an import/export center, and that they often traded luxury goods, such as cotton, salt, and honey, for products of obsidian and metal, which they would have forged. (Paris 2008) (Melbrath & Peraza 2003:29). Today farmers use mixed fields, called the milpa fields, to cultivate maize, beans, squash, watermelons, mangoes, papayas and other crops. Also, citrus fruit such as oranges and limes are often grown within the domestic house groups of the local residents (Russell 2008:16).\nFaunal remains indicate that the local population used varying methods of animal acquisition. A study done by M.A. Masson and C. Peraza Lope in 2008 looked at faunal remains from two different middens, one located in the monumental center by some houses, and the other is located in the domestic area outside the monumental compound. The largest samples of recognized remains within the monumental center were from: white-tailed deer (23%), dog (4.4%), turkey (12.9%), and iguana (10.2%). The combined contributions of fish make up around 1.2% of the samples. These percentages as well as the ones that will follow for the settlement zone are based on recognized remains. Primary animals may have made up larger portions of the diet but their remains are too difficult to recognize.\nIn the settlement zone, researchers  found: white-tailed deer (8.4%), dog (1.4%), turkey (5.3%), iguana (14.5%), and fish (3.6%). Both turtle and rabbit remains were found in both sites, but they were consumed in small amounts (less than 1.5%). While excavating, the researchers noted many fish skeletons, but few fish heads. They concluded that the fish were being traded into Mayapan, and not collected near the site. If the fish had been prepared at the site, the heads would have been common refuse. Within the ceremonial center, numerous deer heads and teeth were found among the remains.(M.A. Masson, C. Peraza Lope 2008).\n\n\n== Trade ==\n\nMayapan was a major capital in the Yucat\u00e1n, and there is extensive evidence that it had far-reaching trade routes, as seen in architecture and artifacts of other settlements in the region.  A wide variety of goods were traded, including maize, honey, salt, fish, game, cloth, and birds.\n\n\n=== Peten ===\nZacpeten on Lake Salpeten \u2013 Incense burners found at this site are nearly identical to those found at Mayapan. The temple assemblages at Zacpeten are very similar to those at Mayapan. Topoxte in Lake Yaxha, Peten also shares similarities of architecture and artifacts of effigy censers. Topoxte architectural remains show a similar stone carving style to Mayapan. Also, tiny \u201cdwarf\u201d shrines found at this site were very similar to shrines found at Mayapan. The two sites appear to have been abandoned around the same time; which may suggest a connection between their governments.\n\n\n=== Highland Guatemala ===\nArchitectural and artifact connections are seen between Mayapan and the Utatlan in highland Guatemala. Examples are similar temple assemblages, the presence of skull imagery and squatting figures, extensive and lavish use of stucco combined with crude masonry, and effigy figure censers.\n\n\n=== Yucatan East Coast ===\nThis region also shows apparent influence of Mayapan, in similar temple assemblages, similarities in architecture, effigy censers at some sites, and parallels between architectural decoration at Mayapan and some east coast sites. The east coast sites exported products such as cotton, salt, and honey from the Yucat\u00e1n. Sites in Guatemala traded back cacao. El Chayal in Guatemala was the only source of the obsidian found at Mayapan.\n\n\n=== Aztecs, Central Mexico, and the Campeche Coast ===\nThe presence of Matillas Fine Orange ceramics in Mayapan suggests trade with Tabasco. This area may have mediated trade between Mayapan and the rest of Central Mexico. Sculptures and murals at Mayapan suggest that there was contact between Mayapan and the rising Aztec empire. Some Mayapan figures showed details of Aztec dress, and what appears to be an Aztec deity is carved on an altar in Mayapan.\nThis evidence suggests a: \u201ccircum-Yucatecan trade route that linked Mayapan to Peten, northern Belize, and east-coast sites in the Late Postclassic period.\u201d (Melbrath & Peraza Lope 2003:24\u201331)\n\n\n== Symbolism ==\nThe symbolism present in Mayapan is particularly significant, partially because the center of the site is mainly used for ritual purposes. There are many similarities between the murals in Mayapan and the art and iconography of the Aztec and Mixteca-Puebla regions. Symbols that they have in common include:the sun disc (there are varying interpretations of what this representsCould represent the sun god\nHowever, the diving posture of the figure within the disc is a common motif used to represent a dead warrior, and because the figure is represented bound and with his heart removed it has been interpreted as a representation of a warrior sacrificed to the sun god.representations of Quetzalcoatl\nmurals in structure Q.80 show reptile iconography which has been interpreted as participation in Mixteca-Puebla traditions. The dentition of the reptile indicate that they are serpents. There are similar representations found at Coba and on some pottery in Cholula dated to circa 1350\u20131550 AD.(Milbrath, Susan., Carlos Peraza Lope, Miguel Delgado K\u00fa. 2010)\n\nSerpent iconography is very common at Mayapan, serpent balustrade carvings are common throughout the ritual center in the complexes that are associated with the Cocom lineage like the Castillo (Milbrath, Susan., Carlos Peraza Lope, Miguel Delgado K\u00fa 2010). In contrast depictions of the rain god Chaac are common to the temples related to the Xiu lineage. (Milbrath 2009:583) There are also depictions of the Monkey-man god\nMost of the iconography in Mayapan is found either in murals on the temple walls, stone carving, or carved stone covered in plaster.\n\n\n== Evidence of inequality ==\nDirectionality may have played a role in the representation of inequality among the powerful factions of Mayapan. East and west were of primary importance because it represented the track of the sun through the sky. The east was associated with: life, males, and heat; whereas the west was associated with: death, females, and cold. This has led many sources to believe that the Itza and the Xiw may have been associated with east and west. There was very little evidence for obvious separation of residence between classes. This is mostly due to the residential center of Mayapan being located around the concentration of the water filled cenotes. Most residences are tandem structures made of several building within a separating wall. Many of these tandem structures include multiple residential buildings; the size of these residential buildings, relative to each other, suggests that some of them were for slaves. The integration of classes extends to the outer edges of the residential areas probably due to the convenience of being close to the agricultural fields. Some sources indicate that the analysis of oratarios or god-houses (large house-like shrines) show boundaries that were known to the people of Mayapan. This is shown in relation to the analysis of household oratarios and those oriented around the ceremonial center of Mayapan. Unfortunately there is very little skeletal evidence found in this region because of the composition of the soil. The goods found in different house structures do suggest different levels of social status, mainly in regard to the specialization of housing structures. There are at least two examples of obsidian workshops in Mayapan. The strongest evidence for inequality in Mayapan is found in the presence of deep shafts full of sacrificial victims, this suggests that the noble class had enough power to condemn some people to death.\n\n\n== Abandonment ==\nThe site of Mayapan was abandoned sometime in the 15th century. There has been some dispute over when the actual abandonment took place. However, written records state that the site was abandoned in A.D. 1441. There appear to be several contributing factors to the abandonment of Mayapan. Around A.D. 1420 a riot was started by the Xius against the Cocom which culminated in the death of nearly all (if not in fact all) of the Cocom lineage. Pestilence may have been involved in the subsequent abandonment of the site by the remaining Xiu inhabitants. There were several sources of evidence to support this interpretation. Evidence of burned wood was found inside of structure Y-45a as well as burned roofing material on many of the other structures that was dated to around the time of the collapse in K\u2019atun 8 Ahua (roughly A.D. 1441\u20131461). A mass grave in the main plaza, and bodies in a burial shaft covered in ash were dated to around the collapse and showed signs of violence, some of the bodies still had large flint knives in their chests or pelvises, suggesting ritualized sacrifice. Smashed vessels litter the floors of the Y-45a complex that date to around A.D. 1270\u20131400, prior to the documented collapse of Mayapan. A vessel bearing the glyph K\u2019atun 8 Ahua was found on the floor of this complex. From this they have posited that the complex was abandoned finally when the city fell (Lope 2006; Milbrath 2003). After A.D. 1461 there is little evidence of altars and burial cists being constructed after 1461, suggesting that the site had been abandoned by this point (Lope 2006). Very little evidence has been found to support later usage of Mayapan. Copal from an altar was found in the Templo Redondo compound that may suggest later pilgrimages to the Castillo de Kukulkan. However, these samples date to the industrial era and may not be valid, so any assumptions based on this evidence would also not be valid (Lope 2006:168).\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBarrera Rubio, Alfredo and Carlos Peraza Lope.

          "About a month ago (Mid-March 2020), my wife and I visited this out of the way archaeological site. We had all for ourselves, we saw just a handful of other visitors, and a larger number of Iguanas. Although we enjoyed our visit to the most, I must say that in days prior to our",
          "This is a site worth seeing. We organized our own tour by renting a car in Merida and visited these ruins (on GPS enter ZA Mayap\u00e1n \u201c Zona Arceologica Mayapan or you will end up in the Pueblo of Mayapan.) I suggest arriving early in the morning as the temperature can heat up",
          "We visited the Mayapan ruins as part of an tour that took us to Mani and a few other places. It\u2019s about a 45-minute trip from Merida to visit this site. The ruins are located a few miles south of the town of Telchaquillo and about 25 miles south of M\u00e9rida or about 60 miles West",
          "The Observatory along is worth the visit. Inside the walls are non-concentric spirals. Difficult to build even today.",
          "A local told us we might be the only folks at the site. Not true- there were 3 other cars. The total ZA is said to have 4000 sites/buildings. There is no prohibition on climbing any of them. You get panoramic views of what the city must have been like. The limited curation",
          "We visited the Mayapan Ruins on our honeymoon and although it was a neat history lesson, the food choices after the excursion weren't the greatest. If you're looking to book this as an excursion from a cruise be aware that the ride to the ruins is the longest part of the",
          "Official name is Archaeological site of Mayapan. 45 pesos entry rewards you with clean bathrooms (with paper towels but no soap when I was there), very clean site, a number of information placks in languages including English, a dry cenote, and pyramids you are still allowed to",
          "One of the old capital of the region, Mayapan has a climbable pyramid and is an incredible site. Small, yet packed with buildings. Entrance fee is really really cheap and you are almost alone, very few tourists.",
          "This is surely smaller and less spectacular than Tulum or Chichen Itza, but this also costs 45 pesos instead of 500 pesos. Having been to lots of Mayan Ruins in Guatemala was very impressed with how well kept these ruins were and the condition of the complex. Grounds were",
          "Skip the crowds at Chichen Itza and have Mayapan - and Uxmal - all to yourselves. Wonderful alternative and much more interesting than Chichen.",
          "One of the best things about Cancun and the Yucatan Peninsula is the ruins. There are a variety of Mayan ruins in the area that is still standing today and can be visited, most notably the structures at Coba, Tulum and Chichen Itza.",
          "If you wish to avoid the crowds from Chichen Itza and enjoy in peace while looking around, I recommend Mayapan. So much to see, explore and learn. I went there early in the morning and there was no one there. My guide, Juan from Merida was so knowledgable!",
          "My wife and I went on a cruise to Cozumel and Progreso, Yucatan. I would suggest to go see the ruins, but don't go to the city of Progreso. The city was a slum. The Mayan Ruins were great, but they need to do some gardening work. I would like see it when it was an active city,",
          "Visited these ruins and was amazed at how quiet it was with a handful of others on the site. Not ruined by hundreds of souvenir stalls like at Chitzen Itza, I actually didn't see a single stall. You can climb to the top of the main tower and appreciate the views.",
          "Lovely little Chichen Itza, everything is in one place. If you go before 10am you will be almost alone, after that it's another story! Worth the trip if you are in Merida.",
          "Mayapan is considered one of the last standing city states of the Mayan population of the Yucatan. It is similar to many other Mayan archeological sites but on a smaller scale. It is a informative visit to understand the layout of all the traditional structures used by the",
          "The Mayapan ruins were the last ruins my family and I visited on our most recent Yucatan visit. It is easily located about 45-60 minutes from Merida. The ruins are interesting, well maintained, fairly flat and easy to visit. As others have noted there are no shady areas in",
          "We enjoyed these ruins, not as extensive and large as Uxmal, but still impressive. You are able to explore and see most of the ruins at your leisure. It was not crowded which added to the enjoyment.",
          "It is much smaller than the crowded and very commercialized sites like Uxmal and Tulum. The pyramids are more in their natural state and it is still possible to get a hands on experience. We climbed several of the structures and got amazing pictures. The crowds were pretty",
          "We enjoyed it very much! Our guides \"Super Mario and Spicy\" answered any and all questions we had, we were able to take our time and see as much as we wanted and we were able to climb the ruins! It was awesome! The Yucatan Peninsula is considered the safest area of Mexico for",
          "The Mayapan Ruins are an incredible experience. It is one of the less visited ruin sites when compared to Chichen Itza or Uxmal as it is more difficult to travel to. My group hired a taxi driver for the entire day to go site seeing rather than deal with the large tour buses that",
          "OK so May is the hottest month and we certainly sweated it here! I think we paid 55pesos each for entry. Toilet facilities as you enter - on the right, clean and well kept. Open unshaded walkway to the main site and the centre of Mayapan is virtually tree free so at 1pm it was",
          "Only about 40 minutes from downtown Merida, these ruins are the same age as Chuchen Itza, but a smaller over acreage. However, amazing to see the temples, sacrificial altars, and important buildings and the open yard. Some original paintings on the stucco can be seen. Also,",
          "This place is really close to Merida. Is not as crowded as Chichen Itza so you can see all the ruins with no pressure. You can also climb them but be careful not to fall since there is no medical aid at the place.",
          "We paid $400 pesos, about $20 USD, per person and also hired a guide for our group. I felt like we got much more out of it by having a guide. He pointed out many things we never would have seen or known about. There is so much Mayan history here and it has been preserved very",
          "Mayapan is definitely not as impressive as Uxmal, Ek Balam or Coba but it still deserves five stars.",
          "We left Merida by car at 7:30 and arrived close to 8:00 when Mayapan opened. We were the only people there for more than an hour and even after that there were only two other people. It was a fabulous, mystical self tour and the main building was easily climbed by my daughter",
          "We visited Mayapan after Uxmal. It is not nearly as large and impressive, but still an excellent place to stop. You can explore it in 45 minutes and there are many fine examples of carvings. It is more accessible than Uxmal and well worth your time.",
          "We decided to visit Mayapan traveling the Ruta Puuc from Merida and after reading the \u201cMexicocassie\u201d blog describing it as her favorite Mayan site. Well preserved and reconstructed, no crowds whatsoever, lots of books to guide you through. Make the trip and see \ud83c\udf1e",

I thought great, I loved Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 but felt it was too big to explore in one day. I was very wrong. Not only is Mayapan very small, but no",
          "My wife and I are on a 1 month vacation in Yucatan. Mayapan was one of the places on our list. It is fantastic! Well worth taking the time to visit. We made a habit of visiting ruins and afterward cooling off in a cenote. There are great cenotes near Mayapan. We went to cenote",
          "This is a beautiful example of a place not as popular as other Mayan ruins. You have the ability to climb the ruins and get right up close. Note they are still excavating the buildings which make it look like not much there. The highlight is climbing up the temple pyramid. It is",
          "After visiting Cenotes nearby e wanted to see ruins. This was a quick drive. No one was there, very inexpensive for tickets and we loved it.",
          "Got there at 1030 in the morning and there were about 150 people visiting. By noon there was only about a dozen or so of us in the entire site. Very reasonable price for emtry...40 pesos. Parking free. Wonderful site...your imagination can run...as there is very good look at",
          "Mayapan is a smaller Mayan archaeological site that is a short drive from Merida, Yucatan. It can easily visited in half a day. Pay to get the guide when you visit to learn about the significant differences of this site from the others in the area. This site bears a stronger",
          "I visited Mayapan with a tour guide and was blown away! Here you can still climb to the top of a pyramid and get charged! The ruins astounded me as I had never been to such a place. I would love to see it again some day. There were few tourists and I enjoyed roaming the grounds.",
          "This is a fairly compact site with a number of very interesting structures including a long, defensive wall. It is an easy 30-45 min taxi ride from the center of Merida. It is usually not crowded and you are free to roam throughout the site unlike some of the more popular sites.",
          "This was a smaller ruin but still amazing to see. But, because it's smaller, you dont have the crowds that some others mayan ruins do. The signs were informational. The best part was that we were allowed to climb up to the top of the highest \"building\". This was definately",
          "This is a pretty cool experience. These ruins are easily accessible and were not crowded at all when I went. Be sure to climb to the top. Views are worth it.",
          "Do NOT pass this up. It\u2019s right off the highway and easily accessible. There were only 3 people visiting when I was there. Walking is very easy and many of the ruins are explained with signs. You are also allowed to climb several of the ruins. It\u2019s serene, easy walking and a",
          "Chichen Itz\u00e1 and Uxmal are impressive but don't miss this less known site. No crowds or barriers to keep you from really seeing the amazing remnants of the Mayan culture.",
          "Just a short drive from Merida these ruins are very interesting. No crowds and ability to climb and access the ruins makes for great views and a better appreciation of the work required to construct them. Some of the stairways are very steep and uneven so climbing all of the",
          "After you have visited the \"biggies\" like Chichen Itza, Tulum, Uxmal,etc. Spend some time visiting the smaller sites. Chances are you will be the only ones there -- we were! It is helpful to have a guide with you to interpret the site, or it just looks like a pile of rocks.",
          "This was our third trip to the Yucatan and we had already visited Uxmal, Chichen Itza, Ek Balam, and Edzna on previous trips, so we decided to visit Mayapan on this trip. Garmin took us down a new highway that made for a very pleasant drive that bypassed the numerous small",
          "We visited Mayapan as a part of a tour with the Santa Barbara cenotes (we payed 800 pesos per person for the tour, but you could probably negotiate a lower price - you can find eager tour operators everywhere in M\u00e9rida). It's not the most impressive ruins, but you get to see",
          "Don't count this one out, it's very interesting and a nice drive from Merida lots to see and only a small entrance fee",
          "cant get enough of this ancient empire. the history and construction will leave you wanting more. If you start in Merida take the RutaPuc or the Convent Tour and stay overnite for a 2-3 day adventure. Wear hats and very good walking shoes...and insect repellent. This IS",
          "Travelled here today, Sunday. Took the 8:30 bus from Noreste Terminal Merida, $37MP. Took 1 1/2 hours, be sure to remind the driver you want to get off at the ruins, or he keeps on going. The bus line, LUS , pick you up on the highway , pretty sure the bus i returned on was the",
          "We loved Mayap\u00e1n! We went with our kids and were able to climb the piramids. Beautiful place without the crouds. Absolutey recommended!",
          "While on a Carnival Cruise, we booked the Above and Below tour through an amazing company called Yucat\u00e1n Cenote Eco-Adventuras and got more than we ever expected! We started at a beautiful Cenote for swimming, diving, and rope swinging followed by lunch in a local Mayan home",
          "Cruise Tour with Carnival Cruise Line. Our tour of the ruins, was named Adam. A national of the Yucatan, he explained the Mayan Culture. The Cenote de X'Lacah is a large fresh water sink hole worth seeing. Lots of walking around the Mayan ruins. The tour guide was explanatory",
          "Like Uxmal, these Mayan ruins are close to Merida, but not nearly as commercialized or crowded as Chichen Itza, which is a bit farther away. There were only a handful of other people on the grounds when we were there, and the place is beautiful.",
          "We went there when our son and his fiance decided to have a destination wedding in Merida! (Go figure!). We had a great time! The ruins were amazing! Our tour guide was almost as old as the ruins themselves, but he did a fantastic job taking us around the ruins and explaining",
          "Great place to visit , very well maintained , not crowded , which they had some guides or audio guides .",
          "You have to make plans for a visit to here when touring the Yucatan. A quite place off the beaten path. Not allot of tourist. And plenty of photo opportunities to see the natural beauty.",
          "More accessible than chicenitza (I am sure it is misspelled). Ruins are similar and you can climb to the top of the temple- where you can no longer climb at chichenitza. The view is spectacular. It was not overwhelmed with tourists. We traveled as part of a tour excursion and it",
          "This was GREAT! We rode in a air condioned bus with bathroom. The tour guide was AMAZING!!!! He even stopped off at a little place to buy us \u201ccookies\u201d (with his own money), which tasted more like crackers. He was very knowledgeable. They also had a photographer on this",
          "Beautiful and interesting site, built by the ancient mayan culture more than 800 years ago, the archeologist believe this city originaly extended into aproximatly 10 miles, and they have found remains of more than 4000 structures in the city!! , we love to climb up the main",
          "My daughter and I went on a mother/daughter cruise on Carnival to the Yucatan Peninsula and to Cozumel, Mexico. Both locations were very interesting with a lot of rich history. Loved in the dolphins in Cozumel and the history of the Mayan people. Would I do it again, yes!",
          "Went here as part of a bigger cruise excursion. This was my personal favorite part of the excursion. It was very well kept and you actually can climb the steps, for now anyway. Most ruins are visited so often they don't let you climb the \"Pyramid\" steps anymore, but Mayapan",
          "Very interesting and informative. Tours guides were excellent and very well educated on subject matter. Overall the tour is a bit rushed in order to get back to cruise ship. The ruins are amazing and you can climb to the top of the tallest structure. Very historic. The cave dive",
          "This excursion was a family fun trip, however the kids need to be active walkers, and so do the adults. There was a lot of walking, and climbing up stairs if you are short this will be a workout for you. It was nice to visit the ruins but I wish they would have said plenty of",
          "This was a great first stop. We got there around 8:30 a.m., and it was virtually empty. You can climb on everything, which is fun. There are a lot of ruins in a small amount of space - easy to see in an hour and a half. The ruins are interesting and impressive, but not huge. (So",
          "These are some of my favorite ruins to visit because not many people are present, you can climb onto the structures and experience the incredible views, and all of the structures are in one small area, making it easy to get around and visit every structure quickly and on foot.",
          "Mayapan was the last great Maya city florishing in the postclassic period. It's an excellent site. We arrived shortly after the open and had it to ourselves almost to the end of our visit. Terrific, although faded frescoes, masks and bas-reliefs. The circular temple can be",
          "The ruins have been repaired so people are allowed to climb on them. It\u2019s better to go before 12pm I went at 2pm and climbed that bad boy Mayapan. It was hot out there. Wouldn\u2019t recommend it after 12pm.",
          "We got a taxi here from Merida it was 300 pesos return and 35 pesos to enter.We had such a amazing time climbing to the top of the structures and just sitting taking it all in.We spent a good few hours there, it was just so beautiful and peaceful we only saw one other family",
          "This place is a hidden gem. However, you do need to have pre-existing knowledge of Mayan history. It was nice that people were able to walk to the top of the temple. There was also an area where you could see some original painting. There has not been that much research done",
          "Not only did you get to see the ruins but you could climb up to the top of one! Simply amazing! Kumin and Jasemine were our tour guides and they had a lot of knowledge on the ruins and were very helpful. There was always medical staff on standby and plenty of water when needed!",
          "Just off the highway, easy to get to, but still felt undiscovered, as just few tourists were there at midday, all the better, as the place is amazing, so well preserved and maintened, on a par with Uxmal, but scaled down, modestly priced and yes, you can climb a pyramid, just",
          "The Mayapan Ruins were well worth the visit, we had the site entirely to ourselves, except for the birds of which there are many. Its a very pleasant compact site, like a mini version of Chichen itza just without the crowds or the numerous stalls selling tat to tourists. We",
          "This site is amazing. no one there, its like going back in time with yourself or a significant other and you have all the time in the world to enjoy it",
          "An inportant Mayan settelement back in the pre hispanic area. Its worth tre trip to this amazing site and dont forget to visit the cenote in the nearby town on the other side of the highway. Mayapan was the political and cultural capital of the Maya in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula",
          "Mayapan is one of my favorite small ruins in Yucatan. It is my standard trip when taking guests to a ruin that is not too far outside of Merida. Very well kept and not many other tourists on weekdays. Highly recommended if you are visiting Merida.",
          "My brother and I visited the Mayapan Mayan Ruins before visiting any of the other historical sites, and we were very impressed with them. Even having visited all the other well known sites such as Chichen Itza and Uxmal, though impressive, we particularly enjoyed Mayapan the",
          "These Mayan ruins are south of Merida and not near anything else. You turn onto a dirt road from the main road. We were unsure sure we had arrived until you see a few cars parked to your left and a small cement building in which you pay your entrance fee and find separate men's",
          "Most of the Mayan sites restrict access to the buildings but not this one. No vendors to distract and parking is at the gate. As an archaeologist I recommend a visit.",
          "Mayapan is less well known than the Chichen Itza ruins but they are beautiful Mayan ruins from around 800 - 900 AD. We visited these ruins as part of a tour with Juan from Yucatan Cenote and we enjoyed them greatly. A good tour guide can make a huge difference as they can",
          "It is small, tidy, easy access for people who may not be able to walk as far as one needs to at some other ruins. Some super interesting stucco decorations still n existence, and one can climb all the pyramids. One tip: bring your own water!",
          "One of the few Mayan ruins that has not become a circus. Tour at your own pace, enjoy the peaceful countryside. Signs explaining what you are seeing.",
          "Not as impressive as Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 but with its own attractions like the walkable Caracol, a Castillo you're allowed to climb and a unique floor painting.",
          "Went to Mayapan on Friday afternoon and stayed for 2 hours. We saw exactly 5 other visitors. We were able to climb through many of the buildings. Spectacular view of the site from the top of The Temple of Kukulcan. Mayapan is not as big or well signed as Chichen Itza or Uxmal",
          "On a previous visit to Merida, we took tours to Chichen Itza, Uxmal, Kabah and Celestun. This time we wanted to branch out and visit some of the lesser known sites. So we booked the Mayaland tour to Mayapan and the Caves of Loltun. All our previous tours had been great, but",
          "Mayapan is a small site, but nevertheless with some impressive structures. It\u2019s not far off the beaten path between Chichen Itza and Merida, so it\u2019s worth the stop. Unlike Chichen Itza there was almost no one there, so we had the place almost all to ourselves.",
          "Mayalan was recommended by a local as the best smaller site with very few visitors, hence quiet. We visited the afternoon after the morning in Uxmal. While Mayapan id not to be compared to Uxmal, it wins in that there are so few visitors( NO visitor centre at all),and all the",
          "This place is a mast do, if you want to escape the tourist crowds. It was 40c entry fee on arrival and you are free to roam around. The signage is in English and Spanish. Please note*** I went here by myself for the morning. I thought the easiest option for myself was to get",
          "Mayapan is well worth the forty minute trip outside Merida. There are unique carvings and masks. Give yourself a couple of hours to tour the site.",
          "Thought I never get here, too remote .... Not so too remote from Merida though... Our group of 8 and 5 other people were the only ones there ... Very well preserved",
          "Mayapan Ruins are the one best ruins of Yucatan state. I prefer them because are very close to each other and they look so conserved . you can enjoy of these place in a calm and relaxed way.",
          "This was my first time ever visiting pyramids. It was not on my radar until the owner of our bed and breakfast in Merida suggested it before we did the visit to Uxmal. That was the best decision ever. You can actually climb the largest pyramid here and the energy and magic",
          "This was our 5th visit to a Mayan archeological site and was by far the most interesting, second only to Uxmal. Many many structures to look at and climb and photograph. Great relief to not have touristy things like gift stores and tour guides soliciting your business. A large",
          "The Mayapan ruins are right up there with Uxmal in being a great site to visit. The ruins are not as grand and awe inspiring as Uxmal but they are very accessible, non commercial, and interesting. It is a site with extensive ruins that are open to climbing and viewing. A",
          "We visited here and Chichen Itza the previous day and it was like night and day. The site is not difficult to get to by public transport and it was quiet without being deserted, we could climb the pyramids and get the views over the site which we worth having. I admit, not the",
          "I went with my Friends to visit this place and it\u00b4s really beautiful, the voew at the top of the piramid is amazing, I recomend this place if you come to visit Yucatan",
          "Far less crowded that Chichen Itza and wonderful details in the ruins. Convenient to Merida and surrounds.Available for climbing.",
          "We arrived just as the site opened and, for the most part, had the place to ourselves. You really have the sense of what this place must have been as a busy city. At the base of the large pyramid, they have preserved some of the original carvings. The view from the top really",
          "Few tourists make it to Mayapan so it is a hidden gem! There are actually more buildings here than we expected, including one quite steep, tall pyramid type structure. Climbing is still allowed on all the ruins but some are very steep and can be treadherous. A lovely, quiet",
          "Mayapan is a magical place, is the city where the Mayans rehearsed the buildings they will later make bigger in Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Very close to Merida, if you can visit in the equinox it will be a wonderful experience",
          "We were on a private tour and chose Mayapan ruins over other options because it is less visited and not crowded with tourists. As I reviewed each option this site is not much different. The main difference was the type of stone used in construction and it is unique because it",
          "This place is breathtaking. The amount of skill and belief that went into building these is unreal. We had the privilege of climbing the tallest pyramid. SO cool. Coming down was a little scary, but only for those of us who are scared of heights!",
          "This archeological site has very few visitors but it is worth seeing. There are several pyramids and buildings to see, with a main pyramid having a good view, but with an unusually steep climb.",
          "I was the only tourist here on my birthday at 4pm. I was standing on the top of the pyramid and felt like someone standing on the top of the world. My favourite place in Mexico. Loved it.",
          "Great, quiet area, not as visited as most, but certainely worth the trip... Ruins are fantastic, can climb on most ot them.",
          "Great hands on exploration of an ancient Mayan ruin. Angel our tour guide from Lawsons was knowledgeable. We explored the site at our own pace and stayed as long as we wished.",
          "We had this place all to ourselves. I kept wondering why no one else was around, felt it was too good to be true. We spent about 2 hours walking around. This was also my second attempt to climb a pyramid and I finally did it! My advice for novice climbers - don't look up or",
          "Great ruins you can get to by car from Merida. There were literally three other cars the whole time we were there. We had a guide that helped us figure out what was what and we enjoyed climbing to the top.",
          "Small park. No one was in area while we were there. Interesting buildings. We were able to climb all structures.",
          "It is less than one hour from Merida, it is easy to get there, not expensive, less crowded than other archeological sites and very nice. I would strongly recommend you to visit Mayapan if you like Mayan ruins and are visiting yucatan peninsula. you will find several buildings",
          "Smaller site, can easily be walked through and plenty of shade available. Beautiful ruins that are mostly intact and you can climb them if you feel the need. Informative plaques at almost every structure help grasp what this site once looked like. Best of all, you will probably",
          "We visited this site with Yucatan cenotes on a personal tour for our anniversary. It was wonderful. You can walk or climb at your own pace. Its a beautiful old ruins and quite a climb to top of biggest pyramid. Entry fee is about 20 peso a piece. So much history can be seen",
          "Mayapan is an excellent site to visit. Not crowded and where some actual color of the original structures can be seen where the sun has not bleached it away. Worth the trip out of Merida.",
          "Mayapan is close to Merida and nicely restored. It was the last capital of the Maya and has a well-documented history. The cool thing is that if you go during the week, you will probably have it to yourself. Read up on it before you go. Easiest to rent a car, but you can also",
          "We initially thought about taking a bus to get to the Mayapan ruins from Merida when planning our vacation. However, once we arrived and befriended a taxi driver in the previous days, we decided to go by taxi. It was less expensive than what a tour would have cost us and we",
          "This small but intact site was one of our favorites. It's not highly publicized so it was pretty calm and quiet and enjoyable.",
          "Incluso August 24th, 2016 I got married by a mayan wedding and he Made our Photos there! A beautiful late classic mayan site. You should go and visit it. My husband and I are Federal licensed tourist guides and we love the cultur and our country. Welcome!",
          "We were the only 2 tourists that day. Beautiful temple complex. Still able to walk between the old stone buildings & even climb to the top where the most spectacular views over flat Yukatan awaits. Well worth the 40 pesos! 30mins to 1hr sufficient for the visit.",
          "We took the Merida bus tour for 25.00. Very glad we went. Lots of history. You can walk right up to and take good pics. Our tour guide gave the best information.",
          "I went here on a tour from Merida after hearing it was a mini-Chichen itza. This place to me was on par or even better than Chichen itza. The ruins were awesome and we pretty much go to explore the ruins by ourselves. You actually get to climb the pyramids and once you get to",
          "Just happened to go to this historical site from a sign on the road. Great hidden treasure with self guiding information. Easily found.",
          "We did Chichen Itza, Uxmal, the Ruta Puuc and Mayapan. All are worth seeing. Mayapan is quite incredibly restored and amazing that one can climb up to the pyramid. Some of the other reviews and information we got said that it is a place that likely one would be in solitude and",
          "Mayapan is less developed than Chichen Itza, but it has several reconstructed buildings, and they are all climbable! It's on the Convent Route and easily reached from Merida, but few people go there. You will have no problem taking photos without another tourist walking in",
          "The really good point is the lack of tourists. You can still clamber up the main pyramid for a view of the ruins and the surrounding forest. There are a few paintings to track down that are faded and fragmented. I've seen the other set piece UNESCO sites in the Yucatan a number",
          "Not crowded at all, but we ventured out to go to a series of cenotes. They were outstanding! Just follow the signs and be prepared to stay a few hours. We got finished with all three at dusk, which made driving back to Merida a little nerve racking.",
          "There are many Mayan ruins in the Yucat\u00e1n but these are very user friendly and not overflowing with tourists like Chichen Itza. Also, you can still climb the pyramid. Aguide is useful but not essential unless you want in depth history and greater details than the average guide",
          "Astonishing ruins. But Murals are too damaged. I loved the visit and learned a lot from the mayan. Then visited cenotes nearby it was pretty cool.",
          "We stopped on our journey to several cenotes in the area, just because we had time. So glad we did! There were 7 of us and just a handful of others. We sauntered about and climbed all the climable spots for a wonderfully relaxing hour and some. Views were fabulous. We were",
          "Mayan (Banner of the Maya) was one of the last major capital, and was densely populated walled city. It existed after Chichen Itza - and the central area resembles Chichen Itza with a round structure (like the observatory) and a 'Castillo' with 4 staircases. The central core of",
          "So nice. There are so many little buildings. A great place to explore if you're done climbing really high pyramids and your knees hurt. There's a lot to see, but it's all close in. There isn't anything that stands out as awesome. But there's so few people at any given time",
          "Fascinating place, our guide was very informative and took time to answer all questions, It's an all day trip as there is so much to see.its in the jungle region and gets really hot & humid, drink a lot of water if you can. They have a restaurant on site also changing rooms if",
          "It was quiet and extensive: good stop when going on Ruta Puuc (a little off RP). We were glad we made the side trip.",
          "We have lived in this region for years but never went to Mayapan, it's amazing. There are so few tourists that go here that's it's still lovely, no vendors in sight and clean!!! I hate to see it get congested but I will say, go if you get a chance.",
          "Mayapan is an excellent example of Mayan Ruins. It is a quick bus ride to visit Mayapan or you can rent a car to visit several ruins on Ruta Puuc.",
          "Another well preserved archeological site, though not as large or impressive as Uxmal. Perhaps because it is smaller, it wasn't nearly as crowded as Uxmal either. If you are into ruins and in Merida, it's worth seeing.",
          "Mayapan is the unadulterated view of later Mayan culture. It is not as grande as some of the more commercialized sites like Uxmal or Chichen Itza, but it gives you a better idea of how the Mayans (ultimately unsuccessfully) tried to adapt to their failing environment caused by",
          "Although not the largest of the sites and not nearly as well known as Chichen Itza, Uxmal, or Pelanque, it is little gem. Peaceful, serene, and easily negotiated in one morning. Simply beautiful. Not to miss.",
          "we visited Mayapan without high expectations but must say that it very much worth it visiting this mayan site. It is quite small but in a very good shape. you can still climb all the piramides and you have a wonderful view from the highest temple. It looks a bit like Chichen",
          "This site is small but a real gem. Very few visitors were there when we visited and it felt like we had the place to ourselves. The historic site is well preserved and you can climb on the big pyramid. We also loved the observatory, and some of the detail work has been",
          "Excellant example of the Mayan Life. Well kept, English/Spanish guides that are very knowledgeable. Wear comfortable clothes and sneakers.",
          "Mayapan is very easy to reach from Highway 184 (you exit the highway, and the entrance is right there, fee was 40 pesos). We went there with a 2-year-old on Dec 26, and managed to tour the place within 1.5 hours (9:45-11:15am). There were no vendors on site so bring your water.",
          "Mayapan (meaning Mayan flag) was the center of power in the Yucatan after the decline of Chichen Itza. It is considered to be post-classic without as much detail as you'll find at the classic sites of Chichen Itza and Uxmal. We drove from Merida and got there early. We were",
          "I will echo any reviews I read before visiting the Maypan Ruins. When we arrived we basically had the place to ourselves. I would imagine that eventually these ruins will become more popularly discovered and may be busier in the future. I would take advantage of it as soon as",
          "Mayapan has been settled from ca. 1050 until 1400. In the beginning of the 13th century Mayapan defeated Chitchen Itza. Since the late post classics they built up the former existing place to the biggest city at this time on Yucatan. Over 4 square kilometers there were living in",
          "Mayapan is a smaller set of ruins than Uxmal and consequently less travelled! That means it costs less and has less jockeying for position- but is still amazing to see and experience. You can climb each of the temples and catch the view- which is amazing. Definitely worth the",
          "My 2nd visit to Mayapan, you can catch a bus from the 2nd class terminal on 50x67 it's about an hour.Entrance fee low compared with many other sites and the best part is that you will almost have the site to yourself, or only share with 6 people. Mayapan was once as important as",
          "Two of the things that make Mayapan relaxing are that visitors are not overwhelmed by on-site vendors selling all kinds of Mexican handicrafts or souvenirs, and that there are no tour guides available, so your visit can be as relaxed as you like. The drawback to the",
          "Mayapan is small but very well restored. A small version of Chechen Itza. About an hour or so drive from Merida. Not many visitors - a plus. Note: except for clean bathrooms, there's very little around. Take water and snacks. Worth the visit! Recommend!!!",
          "Very well preserved and still in the process of being restored today. Impressive structures and decorations on the buildings. Amazing size in the jungle areas of Mexico.",
          "I highly recomend this ,great for family water is beautiful,you can climb the ruins which is a great experience.",
          "Great site to visit if you're looking to avoid crowds! Makes for a very quiet and relaxing experience. Also, a great place for photos, as there won't be as many people around.",
          "The star attraction of Mayapan is the towering Temple of Kukulcan, a terraced pyramid similar to the one found at Chichen Itza, around which are dozens of temples, altars, shrines and residences, many adorned with colorful murals and well-preserved stuccos! We absolutely loved",
          "So after reading a few reviews I was desperate to go to these ruins but thought it might be difficult using public buses etc. In actual fact it was so easy. Buses leave from the Noreste Bus Station (otherwise known as the 2nd class terminal) on the corner of 50th and 67th. They",
          "Mayapan ruins were from the last period of the Mayan Kingdom. They are basically a smaller version of Chichen-Itza. We have been to Chichen-Itza and Uxmal in the past and climbed both great pyramids (Kukulcan and Magician's) which you can no longer climb at present but even",
          "This was such an amazing adventure..No crowd, so private...Many stuructures to investagate, also a gorgeous place for pictures..A shower came when were there and the stones were beautiful when they got wet...Went in the Observatory till it passed.. What a wonderful day...!!!!!!!",
          "We were staying in Merida with our two daughters. It was a 45 minute morning drive out to the ruins. We basically had the ruins to ourselves. The kids were able to climb and explore to their heart's content. We avoided the crowds at chichen itza and had a great morning.",
          "Since we didn't want to deal with the crowds or vendors, we decided to visit Mayapan. It was a 40 minute drive from Merida. We were the only one there at first. The kids loved climbing the structures. We found relieve from the heat under an avocado tree growing out of a cenote.",
          "Great site, few people as it is off the beaten track and you have to get there by car, can be reached by bus but more difficultly. This site has a pyramid you can still climb, a replica of the one in Chichen itza (which you cannot climb.) Very interesting site with lots of",
          "This is our first time in town and first time seeing the ruins. The place is beautiful and well kept. We went In the middle of the week and they were cutting the grass. A must see",
          "The place has mayan ruins which locals claim to say they were built by the same people who built Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, in fact there are similar buildings like for example the observatory.",
          "I loved the fact they let you go all the way to the top of the ruins. The view is great and perfect to capture great shots. Very nice and clean place.",
          "These ruins are smaller than the more touristy ones but still impressive and extensive. The great things is that there were relatively few visitors when we visited and no restrictions, so the grandchildren (aged 7 and 9) could climb on everything, keeping their interest keen.",
          "Mayapan is one of my favorite Maya ruins to visit. No tourist buses, no hoards of people, no litter or people selling stuff...many times it has just been friends and me and you can sit and listen to the birds sing while you imagine it back in the day!",
          "Elements of Mayapan are very reminiscent of Chichen Itza, but on a smaller scale and more crudely built. You have a good chance of being the only ones there, if you discount the fat iguanas that inhabit the site. The temples can all be climbed. There are figures in stucco",
          "Just the very center of the site core has been consolidated for tourists, but it's a great experience. It's a cool site and you can climb on everything. I definitely recommend reading the Wikipedia page before going, because the signage is lousy and there's a good chance the",
          "This place is very cool! It isn't roped off like Chichen Itza and you can climb the pyramids. We spent about an hour and saw maybe six other people. The pictures are fantastic!",
          "We were the only visitors there. Magical site where you might be alone as you climb to the top of the pyramids.",
          "The Mayapan ruins are not well known, we happened to hear it about it one evening while reading a book on the Maya, and so the next day we got in car and drove there. What a gem! It was late afternoon when we arrived and there were hardly any visitors, which was fabulous! We",
          "Definitely smaller than other sites, but in great condition and you can walk wherever you like. And you may be the only one there . . .",
          "My wife and I visited mayapan a couple of days after visiting Uxmal. Although the site is much smaller, and less grand (in scale) than uxmal, it is no less fantastic. In fact, we both preferred Mayapan. First, traveling from Merida, pay very close attention to the road signs,",
          "Went on a private tour with Dan Griffin of Ko'ox tours (Mayako-ox.com) and had a fantastic time. I've been to many Mayan sites and Mayapan is unique in the way so many structures are wedged into a small place. Practically empty when we went which is a shame since there is so",
          "It does not have the scale or details as other sites, however this site has several things going for it. Firstly, there's hardly anyone there so you can really enjoy it in peace. Secondly, the entrance cost next to nothing (20mxp?). Lastly, they've managed to find and save",
          "Despite the noise of highway road work going on right in front we really enjoyed these ruins. Went in late afternoon and were the only ones there. Not that far out of Merida on a new 4 lane highway. Only had a temporary sign out front which we almost missed so watch out for",
          "A worthwhile stop and as other visitors have mentioned it is nice to see the ruins without crowds of people. With a good guide it can be rewarding to wander and learn about an ancient civilisation. Weather can be hot and humid, don't forget hat and water.",
          "Very few people are visiting Mayapan, so you have the feeling of beeing back in Maya times without crowd. I personally like this site and the buildings, very relaxing visit.",
          "Our guide took us to this ruin for three reasons. It is much more accessible to Merida along a good road. It is just as significant as some of the more well known ruins, but a small fraction of the cost (43 pesos). We had it all to ourselves. I loved the grassy area leading to",
          "Our guide David Bacab took us to Mayapan, after stopping at the plaza del mercado so my husband could see the local produce. Apart from a school group we (husband, adult daughters, and me) we were the only ones in the site. Though not as impressive or in the same magnitude as",
          "A small Mayan ruin village,but very interesting and we were allowed to walk the temples.The advantage of visiting Mayapan is it is not crowded,time to explore and enjoy the history of another Mayan village",
          "My iPhone accesses Apple Maps through TripAdvisor. If you follow the map directions you WILL NOT end up at the ruins. The TripAdvisor address says the site is south of Merida and that much is correct. It is south of the village of Telchaquillo. There is also a village of",
          "Wonderful place !!! Beautiful ruins where you can climb on. And almost nobody there !!! It was really nice and relaxing visiting this site.",
          "I visited 9 different Mayan Ruin sites on my recent trip to Merida, and Mayapan was one of my favorites. When I first got to the site I was the only person there. That probably had something to do with the problem of finding the place. There was construction occurring on the",
          "These ruins are a hidden gem. Lesser visited than other sites in the area but equally impressive. One of my favourites in the Yucatan.",
          "Like all other reviews, this is a peaceful oasis. Although Chitchen Itza has the name, it also has crowds. Uxmal and Mayapan rate as the best in the area. Stroll through, climb up, take pictures, observe many iguanas. Clean washrooms, pack a snack or plan a stop in Hacienda Teya",
          "We made our own way here on a local Collectivo from the bus station downtown, not the big Ado one but the local bus station behind the Mackay. We went to the village of Telchaquillo and then walked down a road under construction, crossed the highway and entered the site. We",
          "Mayapan is easy to get to from Merida and easy to tour. No big crowds of tourists to obstruct your photos, and only 40 pesos ($2.50) entrance fee. My favorite is the round structure that reminds me of a birthday cake! I have been to this ruin several times, and never get tired",
          "Fascinating site with some similarities to Chichen Itza only smaller. It's an hour and twenty minute drive from M\u00e9rida and it is an easy park, 40 peso entry fee, walk through the gate and you're there. You can climb the large pyramid and survey the whole site and see for miles",
          "How far back in time must one travel to be transported to a place that time has almost forgotten...we have experienced time travel... Walking in the shadows of greatness and wonder...cultural cities from long ago ...remnants from people we will never know ...skills in stone to",
          "This is one of the hidden treasures. There were barely 5 other people when I was at this site. Beautiful place if you want to photograph ruins without people in it. It is definitely worth driving the extra distance. You can climb the pyramid and the views from top are gorgeous.",
          "We traveled to Mayapan with Lawson's Yucatan excursions. We had the entire place to ourselves and our guide was so knowledgeable and told us bunches, while also letting us explore ourselves. We climbed to the very top, which was grueling, but worth it. My man got down on one",
          "This site isn't close by any other ruins, but it is definitely worth going out of your way for. There are several buildings in the complex, all very close together in a compact site. You can see A LOT in a short amount of time, without a lot of walking. The pyramid is a",
          "One of my favorite ruins of all time! Very cool, with few visitors as compared to other sites. If you enjoy ruins, this is one you should not miss. Very easy to get to using a car or you can go on a tour on a fancy bus, if that's what you prefer. There are some tourist buses",
          "Mayapan/Mani Tour Grayline with Augusto was wonderful. Mayapan every bit as good as Chichen Itza but only 2 other tourists there when I went. A Mayan ceremony on a platfrorm, fantastic ruins . No commercialism selling items, no place to buy drink so come prepared with water,",
          "We weren't expecting it to be that impressive after visiting Uxmal a few hours before. But we loved it! We were the only ones there (afternoon). It was possible to climb the pyramids and the view from the top was fantastic. To me, it was better than Labna, although Labna was",
          "I visited the Mayapan Ruins during the morning of November 25th as a solo female traveler. I took a second class bus (Lineas Unidas del Sur bus line) from the Noreste Terminal in Merida (Calle 67 between Calles 50 and 52). When I was researching my travels, I remembered",
          "Chichen Itza is way too crowded. Uxmal is breat taking, but you can't climb the pyramids anymore. Mayapan is relaxed, laid back and gives you a hands on experience. No ved Ndors, buses full of tourists just a wide open beautiful example of Mayan architecture and design. One of",
          "The guide very good and explained a great architecture and people lifeatyle. He spoke Myan and told us that this isnthw common language in homes as much spanish is in mexican homes. This is a need to visit site if you are in the area. I highly recommend this for families and",
          "Breath taking. We visited this while on a cruise and with our Yucatan cenote tour guide. Very well preserved and not over crowded. Make sure you go all the way to the top and get the best views. Lots to see and full of history.",
          "Mayapan was a bit of a drive from where we were staying but it was well worth it. It's about 50 minutes from Merida off a two lane highway. They are expanding it to a 4 way highway which is currently being constructed. The speed is reduced to 30-40 km for a stretch, which was",
          "This was a real surprise! It's a seldom visited site, but excellent and impressive. Be aware that there are no conveniences there, no gift shop, no snack bar, cold drinks etc, so bring your own. We went early in the morning, and arrived at a grass parking area, not van sure if",
          "We visited this site from Merida and it would be easy in a car. We went on the bus from the 2nd class bus station. The bus journey was interesting in itself - with lots of locals going to and (poor Spanish) and note the time you pass the bus in the opposite direction. The site",
          "I would recommend these ruins as it is an enjoyable but not overwhelming trip.An excellent day trip from Merida.. We have visited 4 times but enjoy every visit more than the previous one.",
          "After researching different ruins as an excursion from Progreso, this one seemed to be close to the top of the list, without being crowded. We wanted to see a Mayan ruin site, and still be able to see something else on our cruise stop (a cenote). Chichen Itza is always what",
          "We went to this ruin site because it was part of our excursion with Yucatan-Cenote EcoAdventures (wonderful company). This site was quite large with many buildings excavated. There was a lot to see including a climb to the top of the pyramid which had an absolutely breathtaking",
          "We loved this site, it was a short easy commute from Merida by collectivo to telchaquillo (26 pesos). From there it's a 15 min walk or 10 peso per person tricemotor ride to the site, you can ask trice driver to wait if you don't want to walk back to town. There is a nice little",
          "These ruins are really cool. It's a bit of a trek to get a bus out there - try to avoid getting the Oriente bus that stops at every town along the way! It would be great to visit with a car though. We were almost the only people here - apart from a Mexican family having a picnic",
          "The amazing William Lawson tours took us to this gem. This ruin site is fantastic. If you love history and hate crowds, this is the place for you! Only one other couple was there during our visit. The local guide was great, and so are the frescos. The grounds are",
          "Mayapan is a very interesting place with few visits and very quiet. Bring water as it is very hot and very few shades.",
          "Mayapan was cool because there was no one there. It's like a mini Chichen-Itza without the traffic. The ruins are older and less restored than the bigger sites, but you can explore more, and for better or for worse you can climb up the pyramids.",
          "We have been to many of the archaeological sites in the state of Yucatan and we have returned to this one several times. It is not a very popular site and, hence, there is a good chance that you may have it all to yourself. You are free to explore this site and climb the",
          "We came here by public bus from Merida (from terminal Norestre). The site is amazing!!! And yes, it's a mini-Chichen Itza with nobody around you: no crazy vendors, no annoying guides, no food and no people. Just you and the ruins. There was just us and another couple of lovely",
          "Often skipped, this was actually the seat of power for the entire Mayan state. It is a little taste of every style of Mayan architecture all at one location. The pyramid can be climbed, and there is an observatory like Chichen Itza. Highly recommend this one!",
          "We always bring our foreign groups and friends to this wonderful ancient site. The grounds are beautifully kept, and most of the time we have the place to ourselves as not very many tourists come here. There are no distracting vendors. You can still climb the pyramids and",
          "This is a wonderful, quiet site to explore ruins without crowds and guides. You can climb a pyramid!",
          "Love this place! It's on the smaller side but is one of the best preserved and most researched of all the ancient sites in the area so the structures have substance. Very walkable with a lot to see on the site. However it's quite hot (hotter than Merida) and there isn't much",
          "Firstly getting there, we caught the local bus from Merida for 23pesos, from the Noreste bus terminal, they only run every hour. Trip takes about 1.5 hrs & wanders around the towns picking up the locals. Tell the driver you want to go to ruinas .de Mayapan. He will drop you at",
          "They are awesome and you are able to climbe them to the top. We took dune buggies there threw the salt fields. There are also building remains around to. If you have not see ruins before go see these.",
          "I loved the bus ride to get to Mayapan- stopping at lots of little villages along the way. And the site itself was lovely: small, picturesque and interesting. Climbing the structures is still allowed, which is a huge plus for me. I love getting up high and seeing the views that",
          "this city is magnified by its buildings, is a post-Uxmal Mayan city and chichen itza, I boomed after the fall of chichen and visit this city made me go back to the Mayan era where even the cornfields and deer were harvested rolled down the forest, this city has much to offer if",
          "This site is beautifully preserved. It is not crowded. Not too big. All temple can be climbed. It is definitely worth the trip. There are reliefs, paintings and incredible stone carvings.",
          "A must if you are in the Merida area. The circular ruin was amazing, and we had the entire place to ourselves. You can still climb the tallest ruin.",
          "We have visited many of the major Mayan sites and yes - they are spectacular in many ways....but they are often overrun with tourists (like myself..) and vendors. In fact, Chichen Itza is starting to look more like a flea market than a Mayan ruin (but I digress). Mayapan is a",
          "We chose to visit these ruins because they are off the beaten path. We saw one tour bus in the parking lot - a group of Japanese tourists who left shortly after we arrived. Otherwise, we saw less than a dozen other visitors. The exhibits have plaques in Mayan, Spanish, and",
          "We have seen almost all the archeological ruins in the area. We have been here for nine years as long time visitors. I must say that the ruins at Mayapan rival if not surpass Chichen Itza. The ruins have been restored so beautifully. There is a lovely entrance with washroom",
          "Although not the major attraction that is Chitzen-Itza, we enjoyed a quiet morning here, guided by an ex-pat. We had the place almost to ourselves, so there was no rush, and the admittance fee is not high. We climbed the highest pyramid enjoying the cool breeze at the top and",
          "We have now been to Mayapan 4 times and each time we are as enthralled as the first time. Go early in the morning and you might be the only one there. This is not as developed as some others such as Izamal, etc, but the pyramid is great and the site is very photogenic. One",
          "I had put off a trip here for the longest time, but glad I finally went. Although not as impressive as other sites, this site, the last Maya capital is almost a mini version of Chichen Itza. You can climb the ruins and the grounds are well-kept. It is very convenient from Merida",
          "It is incredible get get so few visitors at this fabulous archeological site. It is large and interesting. They even have an original painting and some remaining paint from others. Our wonderful guide explained things to us about Chichen Itza that we did not learn from our",
          "The day we visited, we were all alone. It is still being uncovered, but it known that was once one of the largest and most important Myan sites--larger that the much frequented Chen Itza. The temples and other partially restored ruins are quite amazing.",
          "This was very interesting but especially because we were on a tour with Catherwood Travel and thus had an expert archaeologist explaining the various sites, including Mayapan.",
          "Want to explore through some ancient Mayan Ruins, uninterrupted by tourists? Want to take photographs of the raw beauty of pyramids and ancient structures? This is the site for you! Mayapan Archaeological Zone is not visited regularly and there is a good chance that you would",
          "Loved this after the bustle and crowds of Chichen Itza. Smaller of course, which means that you can wander at will and actually take a photo without tourist intrusion.",
          "We went to Mayapan in January and as others have noted, the ruins don't receive as many visitors as other Yucatan sites, such as Chichen Itza. The highway is quite close, so you will hear some noise from it but at least there are no bus-loads of tourists! You can climb almost",
          "I'm glad we came here after visiting Chichen Itza; otherwise, Chichen Itza would have been just a big disappointment. This place is like a more condense version of Chichen Itza, but it has some better aspects. 1) We spent about 2 hours here, and were the only ones there the",
          "I can't recommend visiting Mayapan highly enough! We went to Chichen Itza and Tulum on the same holiday, and although they were both beautiful and impressive, what we liked about Mayapan was the tranquility. We were 2 of about 5 visitors to the site, and after a half an hour",
          "My family and I stopped by Mayap\u00e1n on our way from Canc\u00fan to M\u00e9rida and I'm glad we did. It is smaller compared to some other ruins but it was cheap ($36 pesos per person) and absolutely no crowds. There were honestly maybe 5 other people there besides my family. Also, visitors",
          "A smaller version of Chichen Itza with no crowds, vendors, no restaurant or shops. Just the archaeological site which is really wonderful. Without all the crowds you can actually enjoy the site, climb the pyramids and walk around without being pestered to buy stuff. Take your",
          "Mayapan is absolutely beautiful. It looks just like Chitchen Itza, but you will have the entire site to yourself. There were only two other visitors while we were there. You can climb every structure at Mayapan as opposed to Chitchen Itza where you can't climb or touch or even",

          "We hit 6 ruins in 3 days. Mayapan was breathtaking. Beautiful ruins and grounds. Plus we were the only ones there. The stucco is amazing and the iguanas are huge.",
          "We visited both the Uxmal ruins and Mayapan ruins on two different days. Uxmal was incredible, massive, fascinating and has developed services for tourists such as a cafe, gift shop, etc. The Mayapan ruins were also awe-inspiring, varied, had evidence of much more still to be",

          "What I know of Mayapan Ruins - not much, I have to confess, is that it is the most importante site of the postclasic Mayan period. The powerful Itzaes were defeated there. If you like archaeoligcal sites this is a must visit.",
          "Wonderful ruins quite close to Merida. Easy to walk around as the part that is open to the public is just the city centre and very compact. Price for entry was 36 pesos which is very reasonable and you can climb on the ruins. Bathrooms here have just been replaced and are new",
          "There are two sets of Mayan ruins, this lovely looking one and a tired little site consisting of two minor structures, one significantly degraded, in the middle of a rather seedy looking neighborhood in the modern city of Mayan itself. Be sure you go to the right one!",
          "Free exploration of a once great mayan city- no people - no restrictions. Whereas other Mayan sites are roped off and feel like a museum filled with tourists, at Mayapan you can climb the pyramids and imagine the city freely",
          "This was a walled Mayan ruin. It is modeled after the Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza. If you have visited Chichen Itza you will recognize the copies of El Caracol and El Castillo. It will probably take you about 45 minutes to drive there from Merida.",

          "The monumental center that is open for tourism occupies about 1/50th of the walled, urban city. Under all of those trees one sees from the top of the Temple of Kukulcan are the remains of houses, streets, workshops, stores, neighborhoods, markets, and other public squares, home",
          "This ruin is a little off the beaten path, hence fewer visitors and no vendors, bonus! We hired a cab from Merida which was very reasonable, cheaper than taking a tour. Visitors are able to climb on, around and in the buildings. Some restoration is in evidence, we found a mural",
          "The Mayapan Ruins were a nice surprise after visiting Chichen Itza days prior. We only ran across three other families and best of all no vendors. Woooo Hooo!!! We especially liked that we could hike to the top of the ruins. Unfortunately, much of this site has not been",
          "Not too far from Merida, we drove out there right after breakfast and were the only people there for our entire visit. Very reminiscent of Chichen Itza, but you can climb on the ruins and really get a good look around. Mayapan was the largest settlement in that area at one",
          "Wonderful ruins. Very peaceful and best of all we had them nearly all to ourselves. Definitely worth the trip",
          "Very compact archeological site with nice piramids and even two nice sculpted chaac faces (mascaron) puuc style. No juego de pelota. Very quiet site. Easy to reach by public transport (from Noroeste) say Mayapan Zona arch. not to be confused with Mayapan village. Bus stops right",
          "Great site free from crowds of uninterested visitors and flocks of vendors. The site is defined well with explanations in Spanish and English. Some stucco and paintings survive but like many Maya ruins there has been some looting.",

          "Great, but we went after Chichen Itza, and compare to, it was so small. Worth to go definetley, but if you have to pick, go to Chichen Itza",
          "Loved this place! A small version of Chichen Itza without the crowds and just 30 minutes away from Merida. At one time, one of the most important Mayan cities. Highly recommended for a day trip from Merida.",
          "Feeling lucky to have visited such an unspoiled historical area. No lines of vendors here. However, the site is expanding its restroom facilities soon, so that could mean tour buses... We arrived near the end of the day, when there were almost no other visitors. A great place",
          "Beautiful compact site of Mayan ruins. Like a little city within a city block or two. Beautiful ruins in better shape than most. Our 10-year old loved running around and exploring and climbing the ruins. Not very many people visiting at all. Highly recommended.",
          "Mayapan is a pleasant compact little sight. It was basically the capital of the maya between 1224-1444. what is left of the site is compact, it takes only an hour or two to see. Having seen a lot of mayan ruins on this trip (chichen itza, uxmal, ek balam, tulum, oxkintok, coba,",
          "Allegedly a small Chichen Itza this is a delightful small ruin -- large enough to have all the main components of a Yucatan ruin (ball court, observatory, temples, original paintings, etc.) but small enough to enjoy without being overwhelmed by hoards of other tourists.",
          "I hired a car to take us to Mayapan as I found no tours going there. It was perhaps an hour and 15 min. drive. We arrived early from Merida and had the site all to ourselves for about 40 minutes. We did not hire a guide, just took our time reading the markers and enjoying the",

          "Mayapan is the opposite of Chichen Itza in many ways. When my family went to the site we were basically alone--although we ran into a Merida-based comedian which was interesting. Getting there is fun too.",
          "The ruins at Mayapan are awesome, close and accessible. They are not over run, and the sites are well marked and explained in English and Spanish. The site is surrounded by lush vegetation. It's other worldly, a place you can take your time at as you stroll and look at your",
          "We visited Mayapan as part of a 9-day tour of visiting 11 archaeological sites that started in Cancun and ended in Villahermosa. We spent the night in Merida and had an early start so that we arrived just as the site opened. We had the whole place to ourselves to enjoy with our",
          "Although far less known than Chichenitza or Uxmal on the Yucatan peninsula, my wife and I very much enjoyed our recent visit of this very significant Mayan site, located some 40 miles (1 1/2 hour drive) southwest of Merida in the direction of Ticul. Since the ruins are far away",
          "We were driving through villages / towns around Termozon Sur and stopped by the Mayapan ruins early afternoon during the week. Entrance fee about $35 pesos per person. Quite atmospheric particularly from the top of the pyramid (a bit tricky to climb to the top but don't look",
          "We visited these ruins while on a day trip woth William Lawsons (highly recommend) and the owner recommended Mayapan because it's not as busy as Chichen Itza and you can climb the pyramid (you can't do that at Chichen Itza). We were not disappointed. We were the only people",

          "Close to Merida, and certainly worth the drive. We had the whole place to ourselves. The fact that a person can climb up the pyramids, as well as the other structures was great. We liked this site the best of all we visited.",
          "Mayapan is indeed a lesser-known site but it has its history. If you speak Spanish, look for Eric at the entrance and he will explain things for you. He is very passionate about the place and knows quite a bit. His fee is usually around $200 pesos and your biggest problem will",
          "Ok, the fresco of the fisherman (uncovered only in 2002) is interesting, but you can see a replica - and see it much better, since the original is framed in and inaccessible to the point of annoyance - at the Gran Museu de Mundo Maya in Merida. The other frescoes are nothing to",
          "I did enjoy the friendly people, the warm weather that Merida has in January, February, and March. I really would not recommend going in the summer, unless you like extremely hot days.",
          "Great site. Quite compact but with all the essential elements and no tourists. Just you, some lizards and some beautiful mot-mots. A much better experience than over-crowded Chitchin-Itza.",
          "Just 1 1/2 hour drive from Telchac, these ruins are well worth the trip. When we visited we were the only people there. The ruins are well preserved and unique. There is a round tower as well as a large pyramid of the same type as at Chichen Itza. You can see painted frescos in",
          "I wouldn't go out of the way to check it out but we were on another tour anyways. Not much to see and no crowds and you can climb to the top of the pyramid. Then you can see just how flat the Yucatan is",
          "This Mayan site is the best I have been to for families with small children. The site is impressive but easy to see and to walk to all the buildings. It is not normally overcrowded and climbing on he buildings is permitted. I did not see a single harassing vendor anywhere. A",
          "We visited Mayapan on our own by taxi from Merida \u2013 I think it cost 600MXN for the two of us return, including up to two hours waiting time. It was one of our favourite Mayan sites, not because it\u2019s the best \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most recent, by which time the Mayans had apparently",
          "Important Toltec/Maya site in postclassic period. Some painted murals still visible. Can climb many structure to obtain better views of the city. As with most Yucatan sites, the guided comments on ground tablets need reworking.",
          "30-meter pyramid you can climb - No crowd, in fact, no one else. A great site and a great half-day trip from Merida.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting Mayapan because it has everything I look for when visiting ruins: it has the Castillo de Kukulc\u00e1n (pyramid structure which you can climb), a cenote (but you can't go in), the round temple and amazing paintings. I highly recommend visiting this",
          "We were heading to Merida and the sun was strong and the temperature was hot. Our Mexican trip always revolves around 3 or 4 major ruins but after a day or two of climbing and walking, we always seem to be \"ruined\" out faster than expected. Mayapan was a nice way to finish our",
          "Mayapan, Mayan ruins in Merida Yucatan, is an attraction that demonstrates the ingenuity of the early Mayan culture and the strength of the human spirit. It is also one of the few remaining attractions where you can experience the entire feeling of the past by being able to",

          "Mayapan is the last Mayan city in the Yucatan and has a fascinating history. Read up online before visiting as there aren't any guidebooks or maps at the site. There's a wealth of buildings to explore and as it's much smaller than Uxmal or Chichen Itza it's easier to move",
          "It is a smaller site but which holds a structure similar to that of Chichen Itza, a rival city, it is an important part of the history of the Yucatan",
          "We were on a cruise ship that stopped in Progreso and didn't want to do any of the \"herd mentality\" ship tours so we hired a taxi to drive us to Mayapan. It was well worth the time and money!! The place was practically deserted, and beautiful! It was awesome to climb around",
          "After 14 years living in M\u00e9rida I finally got to Mayapan with my family and we were very pleased that we made the 45 minute journey out of the city. The route there is pretty direct and is generally well signed. Traffic was fairly light. We spent about 90 minutes at the site",
          "So close, if your in Merida, check it out, we spent a few hours on our way to other sites. The ruins are worth running around on before you get too hot and need to jump in the cenote. Bring your bathing suit, it's great, the most open we have seen, like a big pool.",
          "We were the only visitors to this extensive site at first and even when a few others showed up, the site was large enough to swallow them up so that we still felt we almost had it to ourselves. Iguana population entertaining and varied. An amazing place.",
          "These ruins are absolutely amazing! Don't miss them for anything. They are build in Chichen Itza style, but guess what - there's no one there. You can climb all the structures and there's a bonus: very well preserved Maya paintings in color. It's such a spiritual place. To get",
          "Mayapan is just off the road south of Merida. This is a large site, but the main buildings are in a compact sunny, grassy area. Included are a large pyramid with 60 steps you can climb for great views of the entire site, a few smaller pyramids, several structures with rows of",
          "When we were there around noon we were literally the only guests. The site is not that big but well worth a visit if you are passing by. There is no shop or toilet in the vicinity so bring water.",

          "Beautiful place with restoration in progress. There are several large structures intact. Recommend you review the layout on the internet. One of the few places where you can still climb to the top of the main pyramid. 35 peso entry fee and very few people take the time to",
          "We got there about 3:30 on a Wednesday. There were no other tourists to compete with at that time. It is bigger than Chicen Itza and as not commercialized. It closes at 5:00. This was well worth the time. Take the time to do some history search before you go.",
          "Mayapan is good and interesting, but it needs more explaination of the site. And it defo needs a small tienda (shop)",
          "The ruins are wonderful. My tip is to go as soon at the park opens. No one is there, you will have the site to yourself. Towards noon and thereafter it becomes quite crowded.",
          "We did not plan to visit Mayapan but just stopped when we drove by ... And stayed for almost two hours! The site is really a lot bigger than we tought and we were more or less the only tourists there. Mayapan is really worth a visit if you have time.",
          "By all standards a missing spot to the major archaeological sites in the Yucatan peninsula. This was my FIRST stop in a 2 week visit to Yucatan, I knew it was close by to Merida so made it my first priority. You pretty much have the place to yourself as it's not well known, but",

          "Mayapan flourished 1250-1450 as the successor to Chichen Itza. If you see it after CI, you will appreciate the parallels: Castillo, Caracol, cenote, but all thrown up in a hurry and on a smaller scale.",
          "Not to be missed!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband and I were the ONLY people there. I can't quite describe the feeling I had but the only way to describe it was that I NEVER felt alone. The feeling of the past was almost beautifully haunting. Wherever we wandered at the site we were",
          "The fun in here is that you may climb to any pyramid. There was not much people although it was a high period.",
          "This place is great. The feesto get in were small .You can climb the ruins and it is not at all crowded like Chichen Itza. We went in the late afternoon & were the only people in the park for an hour. No vendors shoving plastic Balams in your face either.....Worth the trip.",
          "There are many Mayan Cities but if you go to Chichen Itza Uxmal and Mayapan you can say you visit the most important Mayan Cities in Yucatan, look under all the huts and you will find the real tresures like frescos, recent excavations and many more",

        "wiki": "Pride parades (also known as pride marches, pride events, and pride festivals) are outdoor events celebrating lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary and queer (LGBTQ) social and self acceptance, achievements, legal rights, and pride. The events also at times serve as demonstrations for legal rights such as same-sex marriage. Most pride events occur annually, and many take place around June to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, a pivotal moment in modern LGBTQ social movements. The parades seek to create community and honor the history of the movement.\nIn 1970, pride and protest marches were held in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco around the first anniversary of Stonewall.  The events became annual and grew internationally. In 2019, New York and the world celebrated the largest international Pride celebration in history: Stonewall 50 - WorldPride NYC 2019, produced by Heritage of Pride commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, with five million attending in Manhattan alone.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1965, the gay rights protest movement was visible at the Annual Reminder pickets, organized by members of the lesbian group Daughters of Bilitis, and the gay men's group Mattachine Society. Mattachine members were also involved in demonstrations in support of homosexuals imprisoned in Cuban labor camps. All of these groups held protests at the United Nations and the White House, in 1965. Early on the morning of Saturday, June 28, 1969, LGBTQ people rioted following a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, New York City. The Stonewall Inn was a gay bar which catered to an assortment of patrons, but which was popular with the most marginalized people in the gay community: transvestites, transgender people, effeminate young men, hustlers, and homeless youth.\n\n\n== First pride marches ==\nOn Saturday, June 27, 1970, Chicago Gay Liberation organized a march from Washington Square Park (\"Bughouse Square\") to the Water Tower at the intersection of Michigan and Chicago avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then many of the participants spontaneously marched on to the Civic Center (now Richard J. Daley) Plaza. The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers. Subsequent Chicago parades have been held on the last Sunday of June, coinciding with the date of many similar parades elsewhere.\nThe West Coast of the United States saw a march in San Francisco on June 27, 1970 and 'Gay-in' on June 28, 1970 and a march in Los Angeles on June 28, 1970. In Los Angeles, Morris Kight (Gay Liberation Front LA founder), Reverend Troy Perry (Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches founder) and Reverend Bob Humphries (United States Mission founder) gathered to plan a commemoration. They settled on a parade down Hollywood Boulevard. But securing a permit from the city was no easy task. They named their organization Christopher Street West, \"as ambiguous as we could be.\" But Rev. Perry recalled the Los Angeles Police Chief Edward M. Davis telling him, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, granting a permit to a group of homosexuals to parade down Hollywood Boulevard would be the same as giving a permit to a group of thieves and robbers.\u201d Grudgingly, the Police Commission granted the permit, though there were fees exceeding $1.5 million. After the American Civil Liberties Union stepped in, the commission dropped all its requirements but a $1,500 fee for police service. That, too, was dismissed when the California Superior Court ordered the police to provide protection as they would for any other group. The eleventh hour California Supreme Court decision ordered the police commissioner to issue a parade permit citing the \u201cconstitutional guarantee of freedom of expression.\u201d From the beginning, L.A. parade organizers and participants knew there were risks of violence. Kight received death threats right up to the morning of the parade. Unlike later editions, the first gay parade was very quiet. The marchers convened on McCadden Place in Hollywood, marched north and turned east onto Hollywood Boulevard. The Advocate reported \"Over 1,000 homosexuals and their friends staged, not just a protest march, but a full-blown parade down world-famous Hollywood Boulevard.\"On Sunday, June 28, 1970, at around noon, in New York gay activist groups held their own pride parade, known as the Christopher Street Liberation Day, to recall the events of Stonewall one year earlier. On November 2, 1969, Craig Rodwell, his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, and Linda Rhodes proposed the first gay pride parade to be held in New York City by way of a resolution at the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) meeting in Philadelphia.\nThat the Annual Reminder, in order to be more relevant, reach a greater number of people, and encompass the ideas and ideals of the larger struggle in which we are engaged-that of our fundamental human rights-be moved both in time and location.\nWe propose that a demonstration be held annually on the last Saturday in June in New York City to commemorate the 1969 spontaneous demonstrations on Christopher Street and this demonstration be called CHRISTOPHER STREET LIBERATION DAY. No dress or age regulations shall be made for this demonstration.\n\nWe also propose that we contact Homophile organizations throughout the country and suggest that they hold parallel demonstrations on that day. We propose a nationwide show of support.\nAll attendees to the ERCHO meeting in Philadelphia voted for the march except for the Mattachine Society of New York City, which abstained. Members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) attended the meeting and were seated as guests of Rodwell's group, Homophile Youth Movement in Neighborhoods (HYMN).Meetings to organize the march began in early January at Rodwell's apartment in 350 Bleecker Street. At first there was difficulty getting some of the major New York organizations like Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) to send representatives. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, Michael Brown, Marty Nixon, and Foster Gunnison of Mattachine made up the core group of the CSLD Umbrella Committee (CSLDUC). For initial funding, Gunnison served as treasurer and sought donations from the national homophile organizations and sponsors, while Sargeant solicited donations via the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop customer mailing list and Nixon worked to gain financial support from GLF in his position as treasurer for that organization. Other mainstays of the GLF organizing committee were Judy Miller, Jack Waluska, Steve Gerrie and Brenda Howard. Believing that more people would turn out for the march on a Sunday, and so as to mark the date of the start of the Stonewall uprising, the CSLDUC scheduled the date for the first march for Sunday, June 28, 1970. With Dick Leitsch's replacement as president of Mattachine NY by Michael Kotis in April 1970, opposition to the march by Mattachine ended.Brenda Howard, a bisexual activist, is known as the \"Mother of Pride\" for her work in coordinating the march. Bisexual activist Tom Limoncelli later stated, \"The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [LGBT] Pride Month is June tell them, 'A bisexual woman named Brenda Howard thought it should be.'\"The first marches were both serious and fun, and served to inspire the widening activist movement; they were repeated in the following years, and more and more annual marches started up in other cities throughout the world. In Atlanta and New York City the marches were called Gay Liberation Marches, and the day of celebration was called \"Gay Liberation Day\"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called \"Gay Freedom Day\". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem heteronormative and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this queer culture into the space. The marches spread internationally, including to London where the first \"gay pride rally\" took place on 1 July 1972, the date chosen deliberately to mark the three-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement. Activists of a less radical nature began taking over the march committees in different cities, and they dropped \"Gay Liberation\" and \"Gay Freedom\" from the names, replacing them with \"Gay Pride\".\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nMany parades still have at least some of the original political or activist character, especially in less accepting settings. The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even Mardi Gras-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, drag queens and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as Metropolitan Community Churches, United Church of Christ, and Unitarian Universalist Churches, PFLAG, and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of AIDS and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and corporate sponsors and promoted as major tourist attractions for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named Gay, the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.By the late 1970s and early 1980s, as many of the actual participants had grown older, moved on to other issues, or died, this passage of time led to misunderstandings as to who had actually participated in the Stonewall riots, who had actually organized the subsequent demonstrations, marches and memorials, and who had been members of early activist organizations such as Gay Liberation Front and Gay Activists Alliance. The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events. Changing first to Lesbian and Gay, today most are called Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) or simply \"Pride\".\n\n\n== Notable pride events ==\n\n\n=== Africa ===\n\n\n==== Mauritius ====\nAs of June 2006, the Rainbow Parade Mauritius is held every June in Mauritius in the town of Rose Hill. It is organized by the Collectif Arc-en-Ciel, a local non-governmental LGBTI rights group, along with some other local non-governmental groups.\n\n\n==== South Africa ====\n\nThe first South African pride parade was held towards the end of the apartheid era in Johannesburg on October 13, 1990, the first such event on the African continent. Section Nine of the country's 1996 constitution provides for equality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation among other factors. The Joburg Pride organising body disbanded in 2013 due to internal conflict about whether the event should continue to be used for political advocacy. A new committee was formed in May 2013 to organise a \"People's Pride\", which was \"envisioned as an inclusive and explicitly political movement for social justice\". Other pride parades held in the Johannesburg area include Soweto Pride which takes place annually in Meadowlands, Soweto, and eKurhuleni Pride which takes place annually in KwaThema, a township on the East Rand. Pride parades held in other South African cities include the Cape Town Pride parade and Khumbulani Pride in Cape Town, Durban Pride in Durban, and Nelson Mandela Bay Pride in Port Elizabeth. Limpopo Pride is held in Polokwane, Limpopo.\n\n\n==== Uganda ====\nIn August 2012, the first Ugandan pride parade was held in Entebbe to protest the government's treatment of its LGBT citizens and the attempts by the Ugandan Parliament to adopt harsher sodomy laws, colloquially named the Kill the Gays Bill, which would include life imprisonment for aggravated homosexuality. A second pride parade was held in Entebbe in August 2013. The law was promulgated in December 2013 and subsequently ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court of Uganda on August 1, 2014 on technical grounds. On August 9, 2014, Ugandans held a third pride parade in Entebbe despite indications that the ruling may be appealed and/or the law reintroduced in Parliament and homosexual acts still being illegal in the country.\n\n\n=== Asia ===\n\n\n==== East Timor ====\n\nThe first pride march in East Timor's capital Dili was held in 2017.\n\n\n==== Hong Kong ====\n\nThe first pride parade in Hong Kong was held on May 16, 2005, under the theme \"Turn Fear into Love\", calling for acceptance and care amongst gender and sexual minorities in a diverse and friendly society.\nThe Hong Kong Pride Parade 2008 boosted the rally count above 1,000 in the second largest East Asian Pride after Taipei's. By now a firmly annual event, Pride 2013 saw more than 5,200 participants. The city continues to hold the event every year, except in 2010 when it was not held due to a budget shortfall.In the Hong Kong Pride Parade 2018, the event breaks the record with 12000 participants and the police arrested a participant who violated the law of outraging public decency.\n\n\n==== India ====\n\nOn June 29, 2008, four Indian cities (Delhi, Bangalore, Pondicherry, and Kolkata) saw coordinated pride events. About 2,200 people turned up overall. These were also the first pride events of all these cities except Kolkata, which had seen its first such event in 1999 - making it South Asia's first pride walk and then had been organizing pride events every year since 2003 (although there was a gap of a year or so in-between). The pride parades were successful, given that no right-wing group attacked or protested against the pride parade, although the opposition party BJP expressed its disagreement with the concept of gay pride parade. The next day, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for greater social tolerance towards homosexuals at an AIDS event. On August 16, 2008 (one day after the Independence Day of India), the gay community in Mumbai held its first-ever formal pride parade (although informal pride parades had been held many times earlier), to demand that India's anti-gay laws be amended. A high court in the Indian capital, Delhi ruled on July 2, 2009, that homosexual intercourse between consenting adults was not a criminal act, although the Supreme Court later reversed its decision in 2013 under widespread pressure from powerful conservative and religious groups, leading to the re-criminalization of homosexuality in India. Pride parades have also been held in smaller Indian cities such as Nagpur, Madurai, Bhubaneshwar and Thrissur. Attendance at the pride parades has been increasing significantly since 2008, with an estimated participation of 3,500 people in Delhi and 1,500 people in Bangalore in 2010.\n\n\n==== Israel ====\n\nTel Aviv hosts an annual pride parade, attracting more than 260,000 people, making it the largest LGBT pride event in Asia. Three Pride parades took place in Tel Aviv on the week of June 11, 2010. The main parade, which is also partly funded by the city's municipality, was one of the largest ever to take place in Israel, with approximately 200,000 participants. The first Pride parade in Tel Aviv took place in 1993.\nOn June 30, 2005, the fourth annual Pride march of Jerusalem took place. The Jerusalem parade has been met with resistance due to the high presence of religious bodies in the city. It had originally been prohibited by a municipal ban which was canceled by the court. Many of the religious leaders of Jerusalem's Muslim, Jewish, and Christian communities had arrived to a rare consensus asking the municipal government to cancel the permit of the paraders.\nAnother parade, this time billed as an international event, was scheduled to take place in the summer of 2005, but was postponed to 2006 due to the stress on police forces during the summer of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan. In 2006, it was again postponed due to the Israel-Hezbollah war. It was scheduled to take place in Jerusalem on November 10, 2006, and caused a wave of protests by Haredi Jews around central Israel. The Israel National Police had filed a petition to cancel the parade due to foreseen strong opposition. Later, an agreement was reached to convert the parade into an assembly inside the Hebrew University stadium in Jerusalem. June 21, 2007, the Jerusalem Open House organization succeeded in staging a parade in central Jerusalem after police allocated thousands of personnel to secure the general area. The rally planned afterwards was canceled due to an unrelated national fire brigade strike which prevented proper permits from being issued. The parade was postponed once more in 2014, as a result of Protective Edge Operation.\n\n\n==== Japan ====\nSee also Pride Parade in Japan\nThe first Pride Parade in Japan was held on August 28, 1994 in Tokyo (while the names were not Pride Parade until 2007). In 2005, an administrative institution, the Tokyo Pride was founded to have Pride Parade constantly every year.\nMobilization of each parade were 2,000 people in 2000, 4,500 people in 2002, 2,800 people in 2007, 4,500 people in 2010, and 4,500 people in 2012.\nThe Pride Parades in Japan are trying to mobilize more people especially the young by inviting celebrities and making more bright images of the parade.\n\nTokyo\n1994\u20131999 Tokyo Lesbian Gay Parade, sponsored by a gay-oriented magazine\n2000\u20132002, 2005\u20132006 Tokyo Lesbian & Gay Parade\n2007\u20132010 Tokyo Pride Parade\nApril 29, 2012\u3000Tokyo Rainbow Pride, another organization\nAugust 11, 2012\u3000Save the Pride\nApril 25\u201326, 2020 Rainbow Parade (upcoming)\nOther\n1996\u20131999, 2001\u20132012\uff5e\u3000Rainbow March Sapporo\nMay 13, 2006 Kobe gay parade, the Kansai's first holding.\n2007\u3000LGBTIQ Pride March in Kobe 2007\n2006 \u2013 2007\uff5e\u3000Kansai Rainbow Parade\nMay 4, 2007\u3000Queer Rainbow Parade in Hakata\n\n\n==== South Korea ====\nQueer Culture Festivals in South Korea consist of pride parades and various other LGBT events, such as film festivals. Currently there are eight Queer Culture Festivals, including Seoul Queer Culture Festival (since 2000), Daegu Queer Culture Festival (since 2009), Busan Queer Culture Festival (since 2017), Jeju Queer Culture Festival (since 2017), Jeonju Queer Culture Festival (since 2018), Gwangju Queer Culture Festival (since 2018), and Incheon Queer Culture Festival (since 2018).\n\n\n==== Nepal ====\n\nNepal Pride Parade is organized on June 29 every year. There are also Pride Parades organized by Blue Diamond Society and Mitini Nepal. A youth-led pride parade which uses broader umbrella terms as Queer and MOGAI, is organized by Queer Youth Group and Queer Rights Collective. Blue Diamond Society's rally on Gai Jatra is technically not considered as a Pride Parade. Mitini Nepal organizes Pride Parades on Feb 14 while, a Queer Womxn Pride is also organized on International Women's Day.\n\n\n==== Philippines ====\n\nOn June 26, 1994, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, Progressive Organization of Gays in the Philippines (ProGay Philippines) and Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) Manila organized the first LGBT Pride March in Philippines, marching from EDSA corner Quezon Avenue to Quezon City Memorial Circle (Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines) and highlighting broad social issues. At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.\nIn 1995 MCC, ProGay Philippines and other organizations held internal celebrations. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in \"marching by\" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.\nIn 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born. Since then, TFP has been organizing the annual Metro Manila Pride March. In 2003, a decision was made to move the Pride March from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10).\nOn December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme \"CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights\" was held along the streets of Espa\u00f1a and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Metro Manila Pride March with the theme: Come Out For Love Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July. The turnout of the event was an estimated number of 2,000 participants. The following 2016 Metro Manila Pride March was themed Let Love In. There was an uncertainty whether or not the event would take place due to the Orlando Nightclub Shooting, but the event still pushed through. The march began at Luneta Park on the 25th of June 2016. The 2017 Pride March was entitled #HereTogether. On the 24th of June that year, members and supporters of the LGBT Community gathered at Plaza de los Alcaldes, Marikina to begin the 2017 Metro Manila Pride March.In the 2018 edition of the country's Metro Manila Pride March and Festival, which commenced last June 30 at the Marikina Sports Complex with the theme #RiseUpTogether, at least 25,000 people attended (a 225% increase from the previous year), becoming the largest pride parade in all of Southeast Asia.\n\n\n==== Taiwan ====\n\nTaipei hosts an annual Gay Pride Parade in October. Recently in 2019, the 17th Taiwan LGBT parade is the first gay parade after Taiwan \u2019s same-sex marriage legislation, with attendances of over 200,000, which the largest such event in East Asia.\nOn November 1, 2003 the first Taiwan Pride was held in Taipei with over 1,000 people attending. The parade held in September 2008 attracted around 18,000 attendances. After 2008, the numbers grew rapidly. In 2009, around 5,000 people under the slogan \"Love out loud\" (Chinese: \u540c\u5fd7\u611b\u5f88\u5927). In 2010, despite bad weather conditions the Taiwan gay parade \"Out and Vote\" attracted more than 30,000 people.\nOther parades take place at cities throughout Taiwan in: Kaohsiung, Taichung, Tainan, Yilan, Hsinchu and East of Taiwan.\n\n\n==== Vietnam ====\nOn August 3, 2012, the first LGBT Viet Pride event was held in Hanoi, Vietnam with indoor activities such as film screenings, research presentations, and a bicycle rally on August 5, 2012, that attracted almost 200 people riding to support the LGBT cause. Viet Pride has since expanded, now taking place in 17 cities and provinces in Vietnam in the first weekend of August, attracting around 700 bikers in 2014 in Hanoi, and was reported on many mainstream media channels.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n\n==== South-Eastern Europe ====\nThe very first South-Eastern European Pride, called The Internationale Pride, was assumed to be a promotion of the human right to freedom of assembly in Croatia and some Eastern European states, where such rights of the LGBT population are not respected, and a support for organising the very first Prides in that communities. Out of all ex-Yugoslav states, at that time only Slovenia and Croatia had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in Belgrade, Serbia in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in Zagreb, Croatia from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and Southeastern European countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania and Latvia have been organizing Prides. Slovakia also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from Slovenska pospolitost (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). North Macedonia and Albania also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. Lithuania has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from Kosovo, that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was Zagreb Pride, which has been held since 2002.\n\n\n==== Bosnia and Herzegovina ====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan Ima Iza\u0107'  (Coming Out). Around 4000 people, including foreign diplomats, members of the local government and celebrities participated amidst a strong police presence.\n\n\n==== Bulgaria ====\nLike the other countries from the Balkans, Bulgaria's population is very conservative when it comes to issues like sexuality. Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the LGBT community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by skinheads, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from Bulgaria and tourists from Greece and Great Britain. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned. A third Pride parade took place successfully in 2010, with close to 800 participants and an outdoor concert event.\n\n\n==== Croatia ====\n\nFirst pride parade in Croatia was held on 29 June 2002 in Zagreb and has been held annually ever since. The attendance has gradually grown from 350 in 2002 to 15.000 in 2013. Pride parades are also held in Split (since 2011) and Osijek (since 2014).\n\n\n==== Denmark ====\nThe Copenhagen Pride festival is held every year in August. In its current format, it has been held every year since 1996, where Copenhagen hosted EuroPride. Before 1994 the national LGBT association organised demonstration-like freedom marches. Copenhagen Pride is a colourful and festive occasion, combining political issues with concerts, films and a parade. The focal point is the City Hall Square in the city centre. It usually opens on the Wednesday of Pride Week, culminating on the Saturday with a parade and Denmark's Mr Gay contest. In 2017, some 25,000 people took part in the parade with floats and flags, and about 300,000 were out in the streets to experience it.The smaller Aarhus Pride in held every year in June in the Jutlandic city of Aarhus.\n\n\n==== Estonia ====\nThe Baltic Pride event was held in Tallinn in 2011, 2014 and 2017.\n\n\n==== Finland ====\nThe Helsinki Pride was first time organized in 1975 and called Freedom Day. It has grown into one of the biggest Nordic Pride events. Between 20,000-30,000 people participate in the Pride and its events annually, including a number of international participants from the Baltic countries and Russia. There have been a few incidents over the years, the most serious one being a gas and pepper spray attack in 2010 hitting around 30 parade participants, among those children. Three men were later arrested.\nIn addition to Helsinki, several other Finnish cities such as Tampere, Turku, Lahti, Oulu and Rovaniemi have hosted their own Pride events. Even small Savonian town of Kangasniemi with just 5,000 inhabitants hosted their own Pride first time in 2015.\n\n\n==== France ====\n\nParis Pride hosts an annual Gay Pride Parade last Saturday in June, with attendances of over 800,000. Eighteen other parades take place at cities throughout France in: Angers, Biarritz, Bayonne, Bordeaux, Caen, Le Mans, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Nancy, Nantes, Nice, Paris, Rennes, Rouen, Strasbourg, Toulouse and Tours.\n\n\n==== Germany ====\n\nBoth Berlin Pride and Cologne Pride claim to be one of the biggest in Europe. The first so-called Gay Freedom Day took place on June 30, 1979, in both cities. Berlin Pride parade is now held every year the last Saturday in July. Cologne Pride celebrates two weeks of supporting cultural programme prior to the parade taking place on Sunday of the first July weekend. An alternative march used to be on the Saturday prior to the Cologne Pride parade, but now takes place a week earlier. Pride parades in Germany are often called Christopher Street Days - named after the street where the Stonewall Inn was located.\n\n\n==== Greece ====\nIn Greece, endeavours were made during the 1980s and 1990s to organise such an event, but it was not until 2005 that Athens Pride established itself. The Athens Pride is held every June in the centre of Athens city. As of 2012, there is a second pride parade taking place in the city of Thessaloniki. The Thessaloniki Pride is also held annually every June. 2015 and 2016 brought two more pride parades, the Creta Pride taking place annually in Crete and the Patras Pride, that is going to be held in Patras for the first time in June 2016.\n\n\n==== Greenland ====\nIn May 2010, Nuuk celebrated its first pride parade.  Over 1,000 people attended.  It has been repeated every year since then, part of a festival called Nuuk Pride.\n\n\n==== Iceland ====\nFirst held in 1999, Reykjavik Pride celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2019. Held in early August each year, the event attracts up to 100,000 participants \u2013 approaching a third of Iceland's population.\n\n\n==== Ireland ====\nThe Dublin Pride Festival usually takes place in June. The Festival involves the Pride Parade, the route of which is from O'Connell Street to Merrion Square. However, the route was changed for the 2017 Parade due to Luas Cross City works.\nThe parade attracts thousands of people who line the streets each year. It gained momentum after the 2015 Marriage Equality Referendum.\n\n\n==== Italy ====\n\nThe first public demonstration by gay people in Italy took place in San Remo on April 5, 1972, and was in protest against the International Congress on Sexual Deviance organized by the Catholic-inspired Italian Center of Sexology. The event was attended by about forty people belonging to various homophile groups, including ones from France, Belgium, Great Britain's Gay Liberation Front, and Italy's activist homosexual rights group Fuori!.The first Italian event specifically associated with international celebrations of Gay Pride was the sixth congress of Fuori! held in Turin in late June 1978 and included a week of films on gay subjects.  Episodes of violence against homosexuals were frequent in Italy, such as in the summer of 1979 when two young gay men were killed in Livorno. In Pisa in November of that year, the Orfeo Collective organized the first march against anti-gay violence.  Around 500 gay and lesbian participants attended, and this remained the largest gathering of the kind until 1994.Later, a system of \"national Pride\" observances designated one city to hold the official events, starting with Rome in 1994. Starting in 2013, the organization Onda Pride organized additional events, and in 2017 events were organized in 24 cities nationwide under its auspices.\n\n\n==== Latvia ====\n\nOn July 22, 2005, the first Latvian gay pride march took place in Riga, surrounded by protesters. It had previously been banned by the Riga City Council, and the then-Prime Minister of Latvia, Aigars Kalv\u012btis, opposed the event, stating Riga should \"not promote things like that\", however a court decision allowed the march to go ahead. In 2006, LGBT people in Latvia attempted a Parade but were assaulted by \"No Pride\" protesters, an incident sparking a storm of international media pressure and protests from the European Parliament at the failure of the Latvian authorities to adequately protect the Parade so that it could proceed.\nIn 2007, following international pressure, a Pride Parade was held once again in Riga with 4,500 people parading around V\u0113rmane Garden, protected physically from \"No Pride\" protesters by 1,500 Latvian police, with ringing the inside and the outside of the iron railings of the park. Two fire crackers were detonated with one being thrown from outside at the end of the festival as participants were moving off to the buses. A man and his son were afterwards arrested by the police. This caused some alarm but no injury, although participants did have to run the gauntlet of \"No Pride\" abuse as they ran to the buses. They were driven to a railway station on the outskirts of Riga, from where they went to a post Pride \"relax\" at the seaside resort of J\u016brmala. Participants included MEPs, Amnesty International observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.\nIn 2008, the Riga Pride was held in the historically potent 11. novembra krastmala (November 11 Embankment) beneath the Riga Castle. The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the Latvian President. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 No Pride protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the \"No Pride\" protesters separated. Participants were once more \"bused\" out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.\nIn 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.\nThe 2012 Baltic Pride was held on June 2. The parade marched through T\u0113rbatas street from the corner of \u0122ertr\u016bdes street towards V\u0113rmane Garden, where concerts and a conference were held. The events were attended by the United States Ambassador to Latvia Judith Garber and the Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds.In 2015, Riga hosted the pan-European EuroPride event with about 5000 participants engaging in approximately 50 cultural and entertainment events.The Baltic Pride event returned to Riga in 2018, the year of the centenary of the independence of Latvia and all three Baltic states. An estimated 8000 people took part. The events took place for 100 days from March 3 to June 10 with the parade being held through the city on June 9.\n\n\n==== Lithuania ====\nIn 2010 first pride parade - the 2nd Baltic Pride - in Lithuania was held in Vilnius. About 300 foreign guests marched through the streets along the local participants. Law was enforced with nearly a thousand policemen.\nThe city also hosted the event in 2013 and 2016 gathering around 3 thousand participants each year.\nThe 2019 Baltic Pride was held in June 4\u20139 in Vilnius. An estimated 10 thousand people marched through the central part of the city.\n\n\n==== Netherlands ====\n\nThe Amsterdam, Netherlands, a Gay Pride has been held since 1996. The week(end)-long event involves concerts, sports tournaments, street parties and most importantly the Canal Pride, a parade on boats on the canals of Amsterdam. In 2008 three government ministers joined on their own boat, representing the whole cabinet. Mayor of Amsterdam Job Cohen also joined. About 500,000 visitors were reported. 2008 was also the first year large Dutch international corporations ING Group and TNT NV sponsored the event.\nThe Utrecht Canal Pride is the second largest gay pride in the country, organised annually since 2017. Smaller Pride parades are organised in many larger cities across the country.\n\n\n==== Poland ====\n\nThe oldest pride parade in Poland, the Equality Parade in Warsaw, has been organized since 2001. In 2005, the parade was forbidden by local authorities (including then-Mayor Lech Kaczy\u0144ski) but occurred nevertheless. The ban was later declared a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights (B\u0105czkowski and Others v. Poland). In 2008, more than 1,800 people joined the march. In 2010 EuroPride took place in Warsaw with approximately 8,000 participants. The last parade in Warsaw, in 2019, drew 80,000 people. Other Polish cities which host pride parades are Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Pozna\u0144, Gda\u0144sk, Toru\u0144, Wroc\u0142aw, Lublin, Cz\u0119stochowa, Rzesz\u00f3w, Opole, Zielona G\u00f3ra, Konin, Bydgoszcz, Szczecin, Kalisz, Koszalin, Olsztyn, Kielce, Gniezno, Katowice, Bia\u0142ystok, Radomsko, P\u0142ock.\n\n\n==== Portugal ====\nIn Lisbon, the Pride Parade, known as Marcha do Orgulho LGBTI+, has been held every year since 2000, as well as in Porto since 2006. In 2017, Funchal hosted their first Pride Parade.\n\n\n==== Russia ====\n\nPrides in Russia are generally banned by city authorities in St. Petersburg and Moscow, due to opposition from politicians and religious leaders. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has described the proposed Moscow Pride as \"satanic\". Attempted parades have led to clashes between protesters and counter-protesters, with the police acting to keep the two apart and disperse participants. In 2007 British activist Peter Tatchell was physically assaulted. This was not the case in the high-profile attempted march in May 2009, during the Eurovision Song Contest. In this instance the police played an active role in arresting pride marchers. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia has until January 20, 2010 to respond to cases of pride parades being banned in 2006, 2007 and 2008. In June 2012, Moscow courts enacted a hundred-year ban on pride parades.\n\n\n==== Serbia ====\n\nOn June 30, 2001, several Serbian LGBTQ groups attempted to hold the country's first Pride march in Belgrade. When the participants started to gather in one of the city's principal squares, a huge crowd of opponents attacked the event, injuring several participants and stopping the march. The police were not equipped to suppress riots or protect the Pride marchers. Some of the victims of the attack took refuge in a student cultural centre, where a discussion was to follow the Pride march. Opponents surrounded the building and stopped the forum from happening. There were further clashes between police and opponents of the Pride march, and several police officers were injured.Non-governmental organizations and a number of public personalities criticised the assailants, the government and security officials. Government officials did not particularly comment on the event, nor were there any consequences for the approximately 30 young men arrested in the riots.On July 21, 2009, a group of human rights activists announced their plans to organize second Belgrade Pride on September 20, 2009. However, due to the heavy public threats of violence made by extreme right organisations, Ministry of Internal Affairs in the morning of September 19 moved the location of the march from the city centre to a space near the Palace of Serbia therefore effectively banning the original 2009 Belgrade Pride.Belgrade Pride parade was held on October 10, 2010 with about 1000 participants and while the parade itself went smoothly, a riot broke out in which 5600 police clashed with six thousand anti-gay protesters at Serbia's second ever Gay Pride march attempt, with nearly 147 policemen and around 20 civilians reported wounded in the violence. Every attempt of organizing the parade between 2010 and 2014 was banned.In 2013, the plan was to organize the parade on September 28. It was banned by the government only a day before on September 27. Only a few hours after, a few hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Serbian Government building in Nemanjina street and marched to the Parliament building in Bulevar kralja Aleksandra.In 2014, the pride parade was allowed to be held on September 28. It was protected by 7,000 police and went smoothly. There were some incidents and violence around the city, but on a smaller scale than previous times the parade was held.In 2015, the pride parade, as well as a trans pride, was held on 20 September with no incidents.In 2016, for the first time alternative pride parade called Pride Serbia was held on 25 June, and the Belgrade Pride was held on 18 September. Both were held with no incidents.In 2017, three pride parades were held with no incidents, two in Belgrade and one in Ni\u0161.In 2018, the \"Belgrade Pride\" was attended by thousands of people and it became one of the biggest Pride Parade festival in the region.\n\n\n==== Slovenia ====\nAlthough first LGBTQ festival in Slovenia dates to 1984, namely the Ljubljana Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the first pride parade was only organized in 2001 after a gay couple was asked to leave a Ljubljana caf\u00e9 for being homosexual. Ljubljana pride is traditionally supported by the mayor of Ljubljana and left-wing politicians, most notably the Interior minister Katarina Kresal, who joined both the 2009 and 2010 parade. Some individual attacks on activists have occurred.\n\n\n==== Spain ====\n\nMadrid Pride Parade, known as Fiesta del Orgullo Gay (or simply Fiesta del Orgullo), Manifestaci\u00f3n Estatal del Orgullo LGTB and D\u00eda del Orgullo Gay (or simply D\u00eda del Orgullo), is held the first Saturday after June 28 since 1979.The event is organised by COGAM (Madrid GLTB Collective) and FELGTB (Spanish Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Transsexuals and Bisexuals) and supported by other national and international LGTB groups. The very first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain's dictator Francisco Franco, with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like Microsoft, Google and Schweppes and several political parties and trade unions, including Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, PODEMOS, United Left, Union, Progress and Democracy, CCOO and UGT have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the Spanish government.\nIn 2007, Europride, the European Pride Parade, took place in Madrid. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district Chueca, the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. Barcelona, Valencia and Seville hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 Barcelona hosted the Eurogames.\nIn 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at Maspalomas, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, one of one Europe's most popular LGTB tourist destinations. Within a few years of its existence, Winter Pride Maspalomas became a major Pride celebration within Spain and Europe. During its 6th edition in November 2019, the Pride Walk LGBT equal rights march had over 18,000 international visitors.In 2017, Madrid hosted the WorldPride. It would be the first time WorldPride was celebrated in a Spanish city. At the same time, it celebrated its 10th anniversary of Mr. Gay Pride Spain with the winner going on to represent Spain in Mr. Gay World.\n\n\n==== Sweden ====\nThe Stockholm Pride, sometimes styled as STHLM Pride, is the biggest annual Pride event in the Nordic countries with over 60,000 participants early and 600,000 people following the parade. The Stockholm Pride is notable for several officials such as the Swedish Police Authority and Swedish Armed Forces having their own entities in the parade.\n\nSeveral Swedish cities have their own Pride festivals, most notably Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6. In 2018, Stockholm Pride and Gothenburg West Pride, co-hosted the 25th annual EuroPride parade.\n\n\n==== Turkey ====\n\nTurkey was the first Muslim-majority country in which a gay pride march was held. However, the parades have been banned nationwide since 2015. Authorities cite security concerns and threats from far-right and Islamist groups, but severe police retrubution against marchers had led to accusations of discrimination tied to the country's increasing Islamization under Erdogan.In Istanbul (since 2003), in Ankara (since 2008) and in Izmir (since 2013) LGBT marches were being held each year with an increasing participation. Gay pride march in Istanbul started with 30 people in 2003 and in 2010 the participation became 5,000. The pride March 2011 and 2012 were attended by more than 15,000 participants.\nOn June 30, 2013, the pride parade attracted almost 100,000 people. The protesters were joined by Gezi Park protesters, making the 2013 Istanbul Pride the biggest pride ever held in Turkey. On the same day, the first Izmir Pride took place with 2000 participants. Another pride took place in Antalya. Politicians of the biggest opposition party, CHP and another opposition party, BDP also lent their support to the demonstration. The pride march in Istanbul does not receive any support of the municipality or the government.On June 28, 2015, police in Istanbul interrupted the parade, which the organisers said was not permitted that year due to the holy month Ramadan, by firing pepper spray and rubber bullets.\n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n\nThere are five main Pride events in the UK gay pride calendar: London, Brighton, Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham being the largest and are the cities with the biggest gay populations.\nPride in London is one of the biggest in Europe and takes place on the final Saturday in June or first Saturday in July each year.  London also hosted a Black Pride in August and Soho Pride or a similar event every September. During the early-1980s, there was a women-only Lesbian Strength march held each year a week before the Gay Pride march. 2012 saw World Pride coming to London.\nStarting in 2017, there is a Pride parade for the city's Black community that takes place the day after the main Pride parade, at the Vauxhall Gardens.  In February 2018, the charity Stonewall announced that they would support Black Pride instead of the main Pride parade.Brighton Pride is held on the first Saturday of August (apart from in 2012 when the event was moved to September due to the 2012 Olympics).

It attracted a diverse group, which included members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, allies of the community, tourists and at least one member of the local clergy who came out strongly in support of the LGBT movement.\n\n\n==== Canada ====\n\nMontreal's LGBTQ+ Pride Parade is held in mid-August and has taken place every year since 1979, when a group of 200 people commemorated New York City's 1969 Stonewall Riots with \"Gairilla\", a precursor to Montreal's gay pride parade celebrations. The festivities take place over eleven days, with events centered around the Gay Village.\n\nToronto's pride parade has been held yearly since 1981. In 2003 its activists help score a major victory when the Ontario Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling which made same-sex marriage legal in Ontario, the first jurisdiction in North America to do so. By this time the Toronto Pride Week Festival had been running for twenty-three years. It is also one of the largest, attracting around 1.3 million people in 2009. The latest pride parade in Toronto was held on Sunday June 24, 2018. Toronto hosted WorldPride in 2014.\nOttawa's annual pride parade, Capital Pride, is held in late August.

The parade takes place in the downtown core with over 150 floats moving along Robson Street, Denman Street and along Davie Street. The parade has a crowd of over 150,000 attendees with well over half a million in attendance for the August 4, 2013 Pride Parade. New for 2013 are the permanently painted rainbow crosswalks in Vancouver's West End neighbourhood at Davie and Bute streets. The city of Surrey, in the Metro Vancouver area also hosts a Pride Festival, though on a much smaller scale.\n\n\n==== Mexico ====\n\nThe first gay pride parade in Mexico occurred in Mexico City in 1979, and it was attended by over a thousand people. Ever since, it has been held annually under different slogans, with the purpose of bringing visibility to sexual minorities, raising awareness about HIV/AIDS, fighting homophobia, and advocating for LGBT rights, including the legalization of civil unions, same-sex marriages, and LGBT adoption. In 2009, more than 350,000 people attended the gay pride march in Mexico City\u2014100,000 more than the previous year. Guadalajara has also held their own Guadalajara Gay Pride every June since 1996, and it is the second largest gay pride parade in the country. Gay pride parades have also spread to the cities of Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, Puebla, Tijuana, Toluca, Cancun, Acapulco, M\u00e9rida, Xalapa, Cuernavaca, Chihuahua, Matamoros, Saltillo, Mazatlan, Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta, and Hermosillo, among others.\n\n\n==== Trinidad and Tobago ====\nTrinidad and Tobago organised its first pride parade on 27 July 2018 at the Nelson Mandela Park in Port of Spain. Expressing his opinion on the march, Roman Catholic Archbishop Rev. Jason Gordon said: \"TT is a democracy and as such members of society have a right to protest whenever they believe their rights are not being upheld or violated. (The) LGBT+ community has several areas where there is legitimate concern and these have to be taken seriously by the country and by the government and people of TT. \"\n\n\n==== United States ====\n\nThe annual New York City Pride March began in 1970, as did Los Angeles Pride, Chicago Pride, and Pride San Francisco that year. The New York City Pride March rivals the Sao Paulo Gay Pride Parade as the largest pride parade in the world, attracting tens of thousands of participants and millions of sidewalk spectators each June.The 2011 New York City parade was held just two days after the legalization of gay marriage in the state of New York. Other pride parades include Miami Beach Pride, Boston Pride Parade, Rhode Island Pride in Providence, Chicago Pride Parade, Denver PrideFest, Columbus Pride, Cincinnati Pride, Albuquerque Pride, Atlanta Pride, Augusta Pride, Capital Pride, Charlotte Pride, Come Out With Pride (Orlando), Circle City IN Pride, Houston Gay Pride Parade, Jacksonville Pride, Nashville Pride, North Carolina Pride in Raleigh-Durham, New Orleans Decadence, Oklahoma City Pride and Festival, Orange County Pride, San Diego Pride, Long Beach (CA) LGBT Pride, Palm Springs Pride, Philly Pride, Portland Pride, Queens Pride, San Francisco Pride, Seattle Pride, St. Louis PrideFest, St. Pete Pride, Twin Cities Pride (Minneapolis/St. Paul) and Utah Pride Festival, among many others. In 2018, the small town of Homer, Alaska, held its first pride parade.\nIn 2019 State of New York hosted the largest international LGBT pride celebration in history, known as Stonewall 50 \u2013 WorldPride NYC 2019, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots; as many as 4 million people are expected to attend in Manhattan alone.On June 28, 2020, on the 51st anniversary of the Stonewall riots, the Queer Liberation March Protest in New York City clashed with New York Police Department officers. Police alleged that this feud started as a result of a participant vandalizing an NYPD vehicle. Participants claimed tensions began when police attempted to arrest one protester, leading to them beginning to arrest other protestors. Participants also claimed that police pepper sprayed them and used tear gas. GLAAD condemned the police's use of force, comparing it to the actions of police in the original Stonewall riots.\n\n\n===== Puerto Rico =====\n\nThere are two cities in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico that celebrate pride parades/festivals. The first one began in June, 1991 in San Juan; later in 2003 the city of Cabo Rojo started celebrating its own pride parade. The pride parade in Cabo Rojo has become very popular and has received thousands of attendees in the last few years. San Juan Pride runs along Ashford Avenue in the Condado area (a popular tourist district), while Cabo Rojo Pride takes place in Boquer\u00f3n.\n\n\n=== Oceania ===\n\n\n==== Australia ====\n\nAustralia's first pride marches were held during a national Gay Pride Week in September 1973 organised by gay liberation groups in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Brisbane.\nThe Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras is the largest Australian pride event and one of the largest in the world. The inaugural event was held on 24 June 1978, and was organised by the Gay Solidarity Group and was intended to be a street festival, one of three events as part of a Day of International Gay Solidarity, produced in response to a call from the organisers of the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day, and highlighting local gay and lesbian rights issues. Following a police riot and assault at the end of the street festival, 53 were arrested; with over 120 more arrested at subsequent protests. The then Sydney Gay Mardi Gras subsequently became an annual event from 1979. The parade is held at night with ~12,000 participants on and around elaborate floats.Perth's Pride March was established in October 1990, by the newly formed WA Pride Collective (now WA Pride).Melbourne's Pride March, now part of the Midsumma Festival (1989-), was established in 1996.  The event sees over 5000 participating in the Parade, and 20,000 lining Fitzroy Street, St Kilda.\nAdelaide's Pride March was established in 2003, on the anniversary of their first Pride March in 1973. Since then, the Adelaide Pride March has opened the annual Feast Festival.\n\n\n==== New Zealand ====\nAuckland's City Auckland Pride Festival holds its parade in February every year. In 2018, lesbian couple Victoria Envy and Sin\u00e9ad O'Connell became the first couple in New Zealand to legally wed in the parade. and Jacinda Ardern became the first New Zealand Prime Minister to walk in the Auckland Pride Parade. In March, Wellington also holds a pride parade during the Wellington Pride Festival. At Labour Weekend, October, Paekakariki holds its Pride Festival, A Rainbow in the Village, every year. It holds the unofficial title of having the World's Shortest Pride Parade.\n\n\n=== South America ===\n\n\n==== Argentina ====\n\nBuenos Aires has held pride parades since 1992, and since then have being growing.\nIn 2011 the parade was attended by several thousands of people.\nCordoba  has held pride parades since 2008, and Mendoza since 2011.\nArgentina was one of the first countries in the Western Hemisphere to legalize gay marriage.\n\n\n==== Brazil ====\n\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo Gay Pride Parade happens in Paulista Avenue, in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, since 1997. The 2006 parade was named the biggest pride parade of the world at the time by Guinness World Records; it typically rivals the New York City Pride March as the largest pride parade in the world. In 2010, the city hall of S\u00e3o Paulo invested R$1 million in the parade.\nThe Pride Parade is heavily supported by the federal government as well as by the Governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the event counts with a solid security plan, many politicians show up to open the main event and the government not rarely parades with a float with politicians on top of it. In the Pride the city usually receives about 400,000 tourists and moves between R$180 million and R$190 million.\nThe Pride and its associated events are organized by the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o da Parada do Orgulho de Gays, L\u00e9sbicas, Bissexuais e Travestis e Transsexuais, since its foundation in 1999. The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities, and the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual Gay Pride Parade.\nThe second biggest Pride Parade in Brazil is Rio de Janeiro Gay Pride Parade, numbering about 2 million people, traditionally taking place in Zona Sul or Rio's most affluent neighborhoods between the city center and the world-famous oceanic beaches, which usually happens in the second part of the year, when it is winter or spring in the Southern Hemisphere, generally characterizing milder weather for Rio de Janeiro (about 15\u00b0C in difference), except for occasional stormy cold fronts. The Rio de Janeiro Gay Pride Parade and its associated events are organized by the NGO Arco-\u00cdris (Portuguese for rainbow). The group is one of the founders of the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Gays, L\u00e9sbicas, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais (Brazilian Association of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transvestites (this word used as a synonym for transgender persons in Brazil) and Transsexuals). Other Pride Parades which happen in Greater Rio de Janeiro take place in Niter\u00f3i, Rio de Janeiro's ex-capital in the times when Rio was the Brazilian capital and a separated Federal District, and Nova Igua\u00e7u, where about 800,000 persons live and is located in the center of Baixada Fluminense, which compose all northern suburban cities of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area numbering 3.5 million people.\nOther Southeastern Brazilian parades are held in Cabo Frio (Rio de Janeiro), Campinas (S\u00e3o Paulo), Vit\u00f3ria (capital of Esp\u00edrito Santo), and Belo Horizonte and Uberaba (Minas Gerais). Southern Brazilian parades take place in Curitiba, Londrina, Florian\u00f3polis, Porto Alegre and Pelotas, and Center-Western ones happen in Campo Grande, Cuiab\u00e1, Goi\u00e2nia and Bras\u00edlia. Across Northeastern Brazil, they are present in all capitals, namely, in Salvador, Aracaju, Macei\u00f3, Recife, Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Natal, Fortaleza, Teresina and S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, and also in Cear\u00e1's hinterland major urban center, Juazeiro do Norte. Northern Brazilian parades are those from Bel\u00e9m, Macap\u00e1, Boa Vista and Manaus.\n\n\n==== Guyana ====\nGuyana held its first pride parade in June 2018. It was the first in the Anglo-phone Caribbean and was successfully staged in spite of religious opposition.\n\n\n== Opposition ==\n\nThere is opposition to pride events both within LGBT and mainstream populations.\nCritics, such as Gay Shame, charge the parades with an undue emphasis on sex and fetish-related interests, which they see as counterproductive to LGBT interests, and expose the \"gay community\" to ridicule. LGBT activists counter that traditional media have played a role in emphasizing the most outlandish and therefore non-representative aspects of the community. This in turn has prompted participants to engage in more flamboyant costumes to gain media coverage.\nVarious critics have denounced what they view as a merchandization of Pride parades.Social conservatives are sometimes opposed to such events because they view them to be contrary to public morality. This belief is partly based on certain displays often found in the parades, such as public nudity, BDSM paraphernalia, and other sexualized features. Within the academic community, there has been criticism that the parades actually set to strengthen homosexual-heterosexual divides and increase essentialist views.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDisability Pride Parades\nDyke March\nNational pride\nPeace flag\nGay pride flag\nStraight pride\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGay and Proud, documentary film by Lilli Vincenz of the 1970 march in New York City\nWorld Pride 2017 Madrid\nList of Pride Events\nInternational Gay Pride Guide\nInterpride The International Association of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Coordinators",

        "wiki": "Lucia of Syracuse (283\u2013304), also called Saint Lucia (Latin: Sancta Lucia) or Saint Lucy, was a Christian martyr who died during the Diocletianic Persecution. She is venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox churches. She is one of eight women (including Saint Mary) explicitly commemorated by Roman Catholics in the Canon of the Mass. Her traditional feast day, known in Europe as Saint Lucia's Day, is observed by Western Christians on 13 December. Lucia of Syracuse was honored in the Middle Ages and remained a well-known saint in early modern England.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe oldest record of her story comes from the fifth-century Acts of the Martyrs. The single fact upon which various accounts agree is that a disappointed suitor accused Lucy of being a Christian, and she was executed in Syracuse, Sicily, in the year 304 during the Diocletianic Persecution. Her veneration spread to Rome, and by the sixth century to the whole Church. The oldest archaeological evidence comes from the Greek inscriptions from the Catacombs of St. John in Syracuse. Jacobus de Voragine's Legenda Aurea was the most widely read version of the Lucy legend in the Middle Ages. In medieval accounts, Saint Lucy's eyes were gouged out prior to her execution.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAll the details of her life are the conventional ones associated with female martyrs of the early fourth century. John Henry Blunt views her story as a Christian romance similar to the Acts of other virgin martyrs.According to the traditional story, Lucy was born of rich and noble parents about the year 283. Her father was of Roman origin, but died when she was five years old, leaving Lucy and her mother without a protective guardian. Her mother's name Eutychia seems to indicate that she came from a Greek background.Like many of the early martyrs, Lucy had consecrated her virginity to God, and she hoped to distribute her dowry to the poor. However, Eutychia, not knowing of Lucy's promise, and suffering from a bleeding disorder, feared for Lucy's future. She arranged Lucy's marriage to a young man of a wealthy pagan family.\n\nSaint Agatha had been martyred 52 years before during the Decian persecution. Her shrine at Catania, less than 50 miles from Syracuse, attracted a number of pilgrims; many miracles were reported to have happened through her intercession. Eutychia was persuaded to make a pilgrimage to Catania, in hopes of a cure. While there, St. Agatha came to Lucy in a dream and told her that because of her faith her mother would be cured and that Lucy would be the glory of Syracuse, as she was of Catania. With her mother cured, Lucy took the opportunity to persuade her mother to allow her to distribute a great part of her riches among the poor.Eutychia suggested that the sums would make a good bequest, but Lucy countered, \"...whatever you give away at death for the Lord's sake you give because you cannot take it with you. Give now to the true Savior, while you are healthy, whatever you intended to give away at your death.\"News that the patrimony and jewels were being distributed came to Lucy's betrothed, who denounced her to Paschasius, the Governor of Syracuse. Paschasius ordered her to burn a sacrifice to the emperor's image. When she refused, Paschasius sentenced her to be defiled in a brothel.\nThe Christian tradition states that when the guards came to take her away, they could not move her even when they hitched her to a team of oxen. Bundles of wood were then heaped about her and set on fire, but would not burn. Finally, she met her death by the sword thrust into her throat.\n\nAbsent in the early narratives and traditions, at least until the fifteenth century, is the story of Lucia tortured by eye-gouging. According to later accounts, before she died she foretold the punishment of Paschasius and the speedy end of the persecution, adding that Diocletian would reign no more, and Maximian would meet his end. This so angered Paschasius that he ordered the guards to remove her eyes. Another version has Lucy taking her own eyes out in order to discourage a persistent suitor who admired them. This is one of the reasons that Lucy is the patron saint of those with eye illnesses. When her body was prepared for burial in the family mausoleum it was discovered that her eyes had been miraculously restored.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\nBy the sixth century, her story was sufficiently widespread that she appears in the Sacramentary of Pope Gregory I. She is also commemorated in the ancient Roman Martyrology. St. Aldhelm (English, died in 709) and later the Venerable Bede (English, died in 735) attest that her popularity had already spread to England, where her festival was kept in England until the Protestant Reformation, as a holy day of the second rank in which no work but tillage or the like was allowed.Sigebert of Gembloux wrote a mid-eleventh century passio, to support a local cult of Lucy at Metz.The General Roman Calendar formerly had a commemoration of Saints Lucy and Geminianus on 16 September. This was removed in 1969, as a duplication of the feast of her dies natalis on 13 December and because the Geminianus in question, mentioned in the Passio of Saint Lucy, seems to be a fictitious figure, unrelated to the Geminianus whose feast is on 31 January.\n\n\n=== Relics ===\n\nSigebert (1030\u20131112), a monk of Gembloux, in his sermo de Sancta Lucia, chronicled that her body lay undisturbed in Sicily for 400 years, before Faroald II, Duke of Spoleto, captured the island and transferred the body to Corfinium in the Abruzzo, Italy. From there it was removed by the Emperor Otho I in 972 to Metz and deposited in the church of St. Vincent. It was from this shrine that an arm of the saint was taken to the monastery of Luitburg in the Diocese of Speyer \u2013 an incident celebrated by Sigebert in verse.The subsequent history of the relics is not clear. According to Umberto Benigni, Stephen II (768) sent the relics of St. Lucy to Constantinople for safety against the Saracen incursions. On their capture of Constantinople in 1204, the French found some relics attributed to Saint Lucy in the city, and Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice, secured them for the monastery of St. George at Venice. In 1513 the Venetians presented to Louis XII of France the saint's head, which he deposited in the cathedral church of Bourges. Another account, however, states that the head was brought to Bourges from Rome, where it had been transferred during the time when the relics rested in Corfinium.The remainder of the relics remain in Venice: they were transferred to the church of San Geremia when the church of Santa Lucia was demolished in 1861 to make way for the new railway terminus. A century later, on 7 November 1981, thieves stole all her bones, except her head. Police recovered them five weeks later, on her feast day. Other parts of the corpse have found their way to Rome, Naples, Verona, Lisbon, Milan, as well as Germany, France and Sweden.\n\n\n== Patronage ==\nLucy's Latin name Lucia shares a root (luc-) with the Latin word for light, lux. A number of traditions incorporate symbolic meaning of St. Lucy as the bearer of light in the darkness of winter, her feast day being 13 December. Because some versions of her story relate that her eyes were removed, either by herself or by her persecutors, she is the patron saint of the blind.She is also the patron saint of authors, cutlers, glaziers, laborers, martyrs, peasants, saddlers, salesmen, stained glass workers, and of Perugia, Italy. She is invoked against hemorraghes, dysentery, diseases of the eye, and throat infections.St. Lucy is the patroness of Syracuse in Sicily, Italy. At the Piazza Duomo in Syracuse, the church of Santa Lucia alla Badia houses the painting \"Burial of St. Lucy (Caravaggio)\". She is also the patron saint of the coastal town of Ol\u00f3n, Ecuador, which celebrates with a week-long festival culminating on the feast day 13 December.\nThe Caribbean island of Saint Lucia, one of the Windward Islands in the Lesser Antilles, is named after her.\n\n\n== Iconography ==\n\nThe emblem of eyes on a cup or plate apparently reflects popular devotion to her as protector of sight, because of her name, Lucia (from the Latin word \"lux\" which means \"light\"). In paintings St. Lucy is frequently shown holding her eyes on a golden plate. Lucy was represented in Gothic art holding a dish with two eyes on it. She also holds the palm branch, symbol of martyrdom and victory over evil. Other symbolic images include a lamp, dagger, or two oxen.\n\n\n== In literature ==\n\n\n=== Dante ===\nLucia appears in Dante's Inferno Canto II as the messenger sent to Beatrice from \"The blessed Dame\" (the Virgin Mary), to rouse Beatrice to send Virgil to Dante's aid. Henry Fanshawe Tozer identifies Lucia as representing \"illuminative grace\". According to Robert Pogue Harrison and Rachel Jacoff, Lucia's appearance in this intermediary role is to reinforce the scene in which Virgil tries to fortify Dante's courage to begin the journey through the inferno.In the Purgatorio IX:52\u201363, Lucy carries the sleeping Dante to the entrance to purgatory. Then in Paradiso XXXII Dante places her opposite Adam within the Mystic Rose in Canto XXXII of the Paradiso. Lucy may also be seen as a figure of Illuminating Grace or Mercy or even Justice.\n\n\n=== Donne ===\nHer feast day was commonly described as the shortest day of the year, as it is in John Donne's poem, \"A Nocturnal upon St. Lucie's Day, being the shortest day\" (1627). The poem begins with: \"'Tis the year's midnight, and it is the day's\".Lucia is also the protagonist of a Swedish novel: \"Ett ljus i m\u00f6rkret\" (\"A light in the darkness\") by Agneta Sj\u00f6din.\n\n\n== Popular celebration ==\n\nLucy's feast is on 13 December, in Advent. Her feast once coincided with the Winter Solstice, the shortest day of the year, before calendar reforms, so her feast day has become a festival of light.This is particularly seen in Scandinavian countries, with their long dark winters. There, a young girl dressed in a white dress and a red sash (as the symbol of martyrdom) carries palms and wears a crown or wreath of candles on her head. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, girls dressed as Lucy carry rolls and cookies in procession as songs are sung. It is said that to vividly celebrate St. Lucy's Day will help one live the long winter days with enough light.A special devotion to St. Lucy is practiced in the Italian regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, in the North of the country, and Sicily and Calabria, in the South, as well as in the Croatian coastal region of Dalmatia. The feast is a Catholic-celebrated holiday with roots that can be traced to Sicily. On the 13th of every December it is celebrated with large traditional feasts of home-made pasta and various other Italian dishes, with a special dessert of wheat in hot chocolate milk. The large grains of soft wheat are representative of her eyes and are a treat only to be indulged in once a year. In the north of Italy Saint Lucy brings gift to kids between 12 and 13 December. Traditionally a bouquet of hay is put outside of the house for Lucy's Donkey and food in the house for Lucy to refresh them after the long night bringing gifts to every kid. In small towns, a parade with Saint Lucy is held the evening of the 12th when she goes through the main streets of the town munching sweets and candy from her cart, always together with her donkey.\nA Hungarian custom is to plant wheat in a small pot on St. Lucy's feast. By Christmas green sprouts appear, signs of life coming from death. The wheat is then carried to the manger scene as the symbol of Christ in the Eucharist.\nIn the Philippines, villagers from Barangay Sta. Lucia in Magarao, Camarines Sur, hold a novena to St. Lucy nine days before her feast. A procession of the saint's image is held every morning at the poblacion or village centre during the nine days leading up to St. Lucy's Day, attracting devotees from other parts of the Bicol Region. Hymns to the saint, known as the Gozos, as well as the Spanish version of the Ave Maria are chanted during the dawn procession, which is followed by a Mass.\nThe feast day is also commemorated in Barangay Sucad in Apalit Pampanga after the traditional nine-day novena, where a whole day celebration is observed through Eucharistic Masses, festivals and the procession of the religious sculpture of Sta. Lucia in the evening before the evening Mass.\n\n\n== List of dedications to Saint Lucy ==\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nSaint Lucia's Church, Upton Magna, Shropshire, England\nChiesa di Santa Lucia, Belpasso, Catania, Sicily, Italy\nSaint Lucy's chapel, cathedral, Syracuse, Sicily, Italy\nSaint Lucy's Church, Methuen, Massachusetts, United States\nChurch of Saint Lucia (Iglesia de Santa Luc\u00eda), M\u00e9rida, Mexico\nSt. Lucia Church, Puthoor, India\nSt. Lucia Church, Erayumanthurai, India\nSt. Lucia's Cathedral, Kotahena, Sri Lanka\nChurch of San Geremia and the grave of Saint Lucy, Venice, Italy\nChurch of St. Lucia at the Tomb (Church of St. Lucia Outside the Walls), Syracuse, Sicily, Italy\nChiesa di Santa Lucia alla Badia, also Syracuse, Sicily, Italy\nSt. Lucy Catholic Church, Highland Beach, Florida, United States\n\u00c9glise Sainte-Lucie de Valli\u00e8res, Metz, Moselle, France\nSt. Lucy's National Shrine at Micoud, Saint Lucia\nSt. Lucy, Virgin and Martyr Parish, Capalonga, Camarines Norte, Philippines\nSta.

        "wiki": "Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archaeological site is located in Tin\u00fam Municipality, Yucat\u00e1n State, Mexico.Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600\u2013900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800\u2013900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900\u20131200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.\nChichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucat\u00e1n.Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.\n\n\n== Name and orthography ==\n\nThe Maya name \"Chichen Itza\" means \"At the mouth of the well of the Itza.\" This derives from chi', meaning \"mouth\" or \"edge,\" and ch\u02bcen or ch\u02bce\u02bcen, meaning \"well.\" Itz\u00e1 is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation for Itza is \"enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,\" from its, \"sorcerer,\" and ha, \"water.\"The name is spelled Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the Maya orthography, Chich\u02bcen Itza\u02bc (pronounced [t\u0283it\u0283\u02bcen its\u00e1\u0294]). This form preserves the phonemic distinction between ch\u02bc and ch, since the base word ch\u02bce\u02bcen (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant. The word \"Itza\u02bc\" has a high tone on the \"a\" followed by a glottal stop (indicated by the apostrophe).Evidence in the Chilam Balam books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the Itza hegemony in northern Yucat\u00e1n. While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest. This earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as Uuc Yabnal (\"Seven Great House\"), Uuc Hab Nal (\"Seven Bushy Places\"), Uucyabnal (\"Seven Great Rulers\") or Uc Abnal (\"Seven Lines of Abnal\"). This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nChichen Itza is located in the eastern portion of Yucat\u00e1n state in Mexico. The northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is karst, and the rivers in the interior all run underground. There are four visible, natural sink holes, called cenotes, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive for settlement. Of these cenotes, the \"Cenote Sagrado\" or Sacred Cenote (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous. In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under Kukulkan, which has never been seen by archaeologists.According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, jade, pottery and incense, as well as human remains. A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice.\n\n\n== Political organization ==\n\nSeveral archaeologists in the late 1980s suggested that unlike previous Maya polities of the Early Classic, Chichen Itza may not have been governed by an individual ruler or a single dynastic lineage. Instead, the city's political organization could have been structured by a \"multepal\" system, which is characterized as rulership through council composed of members of elite ruling lineages.This theory was popular in the 1990s, but in recent years, the research that supported the concept of the \"multepal\" system has been called into question, if not discredited. The current belief trend in Maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period southern lowlands in Mexico.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nChichen Itza was a major economic power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee. Participating in the water-borne circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast, Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as obsidian from central Mexico and gold from southern Central America.\nBetween AD 900 and 1050 Chichen Itza expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and central Yucat\u00e1n. It established Isla Cerritos as a trading port.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe layout of Chichen Itza site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD. Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucat\u00e1n to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula. The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998.\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nThe Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc cenote, with the main architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the basal platform upon which they were built.\n\n\n=== Ascendancy ===\nChichen Itza rose to regional prominence towards the end of the Early Classic period (roughly 600 AD). It was, however, towards the end of the Late Classic and into the early part of the Terminal Classic that the site became a major regional capital, centralizing and dominating political, sociocultural, economic, and ideological life in the northern Maya lowlands. The ascension of Chichen Itza roughly correlates with the decline and fragmentation of the major centers of the southern Maya lowlands.\nAs Chichen Itza rose to prominence, the cities of Yaxuna (to the south) and Coba (to the east) were suffering decline. These two cities had been mutual allies, with Yaxuna dependent upon Coba. At some point in the 10th century Coba lost a significant portion of its territory, isolating Yaxuna, and Chichen Itza may have directly contributed to the collapse of both cities.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nAccording to some colonial Mayan sources (e.g., the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel), Hunac Ceel, ruler of Mayapan, conquered Chichen Itza in the 13th century. Hunac Ceel supposedly prophesied his own rise to power. According to custom at the time, individuals thrown into the Cenote Sagrado were believed to have the power of prophecy if they survived. During one such ceremony, the chronicles state, there were no survivors, so Hunac Ceel leaped into the Cenote Sagrado, and when removed, prophesied his own ascension.\nWhile there is some archaeological evidence that indicates Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 was at one time looted and sacked, there appears to be greater evidence that it could not have been by Mayapan, at least not when Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 was an active urban center. Archaeological data now indicates that Chichen Itza declined as a regional center by 1100, before the rise of Mayapan. Ongoing research at the site of Mayapan may help resolve this chronological conundrum.\nAfter Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 elite activities ceased, the city may not have been abandoned. When the Spanish arrived, they found a thriving local population, although it is not clear from Spanish sources if these Maya were living in Chichen Itza proper, or a nearby settlement. The relatively high population density in the region was a factor in the conquistadors' decision to locate a capital there. According to post-Conquest sources, both Spanish and Maya, the Cenote Sagrado remained a place of pilgrimage.\n\n\n=== Spanish conquest ===\n\nIn 1526 Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Montejo (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cort\u00e9s expeditions) successfully petitioned the King of Spain for a charter to conquer Yucat\u00e1n. His first campaign in 1527, which covered much of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, decimated his forces but ended with the establishment of a small fort at Xaman Ha\u02bc, south of what is today Canc\u00fan. Montejo returned to Yucat\u00e1n in 1531 with reinforcements and established his main base at Campeche on the west coast. He sent his son, Francisco Montejo The Younger, in late 1532 to conquer the interior of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula from the north. The objective from the beginning was to go to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and establish a capital.Montejo the Younger eventually arrived at Chichen Itza, which he renamed Ciudad Real. At first he encountered no resistance, and set about dividing the lands around the city and awarding them to his soldiers. The Maya became more hostile over time, and eventually they laid siege to the Spanish, cutting off their supply line to the coast, and forcing them to barricade themselves among the ruins of the ancient city. Months passed, but no reinforcements arrived. Montejo the Younger attempted an all out assault against the Maya and lost 150 of his remaining troops. He was forced to abandon Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in 1534 under cover of darkness. By 1535, all Spanish had been driven from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.Montejo eventually returned to Yucat\u00e1n and, by recruiting Maya from Campeche and Champoton, built a large Indio-Spanish army and conquered the peninsula. The Spanish crown later issued a land grant that included Chichen Itza and by 1588 it was a working cattle ranch.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nChichen Itza entered the popular imagination in 1843 with the book Incidents of Travel in Yucatan by John Lloyd Stephens (with illustrations by Frederick Catherwood). The book recounted Stephens' visit to Yucat\u00e1n and his tour of Maya cities, including Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. The book prompted other explorations of the city. In 1860, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Charnay surveyed Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and took numerous photographs that he published in Cit\u00e9s et ruines am\u00e9ricaines (1863).\nVisitors to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 during the 1870s and 1880s came with photographic equipment and recorded more accurately the condition of several buildings. In 1875, Augustus Le Plongeon and his wife Alice Dixon Le Plongeon visited Chich\u00e9n, and excavated a statue of a figure on its back, knees drawn up, upper torso raised on its elbows with a plate on its stomach. Augustus Le Plongeon called it \"Chaacmol\" (later renamed \"Chac Mool\", which has been the term to describe all types of this statuary found in Mesoamerica). Teobert Maler and Alfred Maudslay explored Chich\u00e9n in the 1880s and both spent several weeks at the site and took extensive photographs. Maudslay published the first long-form description of Chichen Itza in his book, Biologia Centrali-Americana.\nIn 1894 the United States Consul to Yucat\u00e1n, Edward Herbert Thompson, purchased the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, which included the ruins of Chichen Itza. For 30 years, Thompson explored the ancient city. His discoveries included the earliest dated carving upon a lintel in the Temple of the Initial Series and the excavation of several graves in the Osario (High Priest's Temple). Thompson is most famous for dredging the Cenote Sagrado (Sacred Cenote) from 1904 to 1910, where he recovered artifacts of gold, copper and carved jade, as well as the first-ever examples of what were believed to be pre-Columbian Maya cloth and wooden weapons. Thompson shipped the bulk of the artifacts to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University.\nIn 1913, the Carnegie Institution accepted the proposal of archaeologist Sylvanus G. Morley and committed to conduct long-term archaeological research at Chichen Itza. The Mexican Revolution and the following government instability, as well as World War I, delayed the project by a decade.In 1923, the Mexican government awarded the Carnegie Institution a 10-year permit (later extended another 10 years) to allow U.S. archaeologists to conduct extensive excavation and restoration of Chichen Itza. Carnegie researchers excavated and restored the Temple of Warriors and the Caracol, among other major buildings. At the same time, the Mexican government excavated and restored El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcan) and the Great Ball Court.\n\nIn 1926, the Mexican government charged Edward Thompson with theft, claiming he stole the artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado and smuggled them out of the country. The government seized the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n. Thompson, who was in the United States at the time, never returned to Yucat\u00e1n. He wrote about his research and investigations of the Maya culture in a book People of the Serpent published in 1932. He died in New Jersey in 1935. In 1944 the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Thompson had broken no laws and returned Chichen Itza to his heirs. The Thompsons sold the hacienda to tourism pioneer Fernando Barbachano Peon.There have been two later expeditions to recover artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado, in 1961 and 1967. The first was sponsored by the National Geographic, and the second by private interests. Both projects were supervised by Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). INAH has conducted an ongoing effort to excavate and restore other monuments in the archaeological zone, including the Osario, Akab Dzib, and several buildings in Chich\u00e9n Viejo (Old Chichen).\nIn 2009, to investigate construction that predated El Castillo, Yucatec archaeologists began excavations adjacent to El Castillo under the direction of Rafael (Rach) Cobos.\n\n\n== Site description ==\n\nChichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities, with the relatively densely clustered architecture of the site core covering an area of at least 5 square kilometres (1.9 sq mi). Smaller scale residential architecture extends for an unknown distance beyond this. The city was built upon broken terrain, which was artificially levelled in order to build the major architectural groups, with the greatest effort being expended in the levelling of the areas for the Castillo pyramid, and the Las Monjas, Osario and Main Southwest groups.The site contains many fine stone buildings in various states of preservation, and many have been restored. The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called sacbeob. Archaeologists have identified over 80 sacbeob criss-crossing the site, and extending in all directions from the city. Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple colors. Pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area. The site must be imagined as a colorful one, not like it is today. Just like gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.The architecture encompasses a number of styles, including the Puuc and Chenes styles of the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The buildings of Chichen Itza are grouped in a series of architectonic sets, and each set was at one time separated from the other by a series of low walls. The three best known of these complexes are the Great North Platform, which includes the monuments of El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcan), Temple of Warriors and the Great Ball Court; The Osario Group, which includes the pyramid of the same name as well as the Temple of Xtoloc; and the Central Group, which includes the Caracol, Las Monjas, and Akab Dzib.\nSouth of Las Monjas, in an area known as Chich\u00e9n Viejo (Old Chich\u00e9n) and only open to archaeologists, are several other complexes, such as the Group of the Initial Series, Group of the Lintels, and Group of the Old Castle.\n\n\n=== Architectural styles ===\nThe Puuc-style architecture is concentrated in the Old Chichen area, and also the earlier structures in the Nunnery Group (including the Las Monjas, Annex and La Iglesia buildings); it is also represented in the Akab Dzib structure. The Puuc-style building feature the usual mosaic-decorated upper fa\u00e7ades characteristic of the style but differ from the architecture of the Puuc heartland in their block masonry walls, as opposed to the fine veneers of the Puuc region proper.At least one structure in the Las Monjas Group features an ornate fa\u00e7ade and masked doorway that are typical examples of Chenes-style architecture, a style centred upon a region in the north of Campeche state, lying between the Puuc and R\u00edo Bec regions.Those structures with sculpted hieroglyphic script are concentrated in certain areas of the site, with the most important being the Las Monjas group.\n\n\n=== Architectural groups ===\n\n\n==== Great North Platform ====\n\n\n===== El Castillo (the Temple of Kukulcan) =====\n\nDominating the North Platform of Chichen Itza is the Temple of Kukulkan (a Maya feathered serpent deity similar to the Aztec Quetzalcoatl).  The temple is usually referred to as El Castillo (\"the castle\"), as it was so named by first Spaniards in the area. This step pyramid stands about 30 metres (98 ft) high and consists of a series of nine square terraces, each approximately 2.57 metres (8.4 ft) high, with a 6-metre (20 ft) high temple upon the summit.The sides of the pyramid are approximately 55.3 metres (181 ft) at the base and rise at an angle of 53\u00b0, although that varies slightly for each side. The four faces of the pyramid have protruding stairways that rise at an angle of 45\u00b0. The talud walls of each terrace slant at an angle of between 72\u00b0 and 74\u00b0. At the base of the balustrades of the northeastern staircase are carved heads of a serpent.Mesoamerican cultures periodically superimposed larger structures over older ones, and the Temple of Kukulcan is one such example. In the mid-1930s, the Mexican government sponsored an excavation of the temple. After several false starts, they discovered a staircase under the north side of the pyramid. By digging from the top, they found another temple buried below the current one.Inside the temple chamber was a Chac Mool statue and a throne in the shape of Jaguar, painted red and with spots made of inlaid jade. The Mexican government excavated a tunnel from the base of the north staircase, up the earlier pyramid's stairway to the hidden temple, and opened it to tourists. In 2006, INAH closed the throne room to the public.Around the Spring and Autumn equinoxes, in the late afternoon, the northwest corner of the pyramid casts a series of triangular shadows against the western balustrade on the north side that evokes the appearance of a serpent wriggling down the staircase, which some scholars have suggested is a representation of the feathered-serpent god Kukulcan. It is a widespread belief that this light-and-shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes, but the idea is highly unlikely: it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes, making impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone.\n\n\n===== Great Ball Court =====\n\nArchaeologists have identified thirteen ballcourts for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame in Chichen Itza, but the Great Ball Court about 150 metres (490 ft) to the north-west of the Castillo is by far the most impressive. It is the largest and best preserved ball court in ancient Mesoamerica. It measures 168 by 70 metres (551 by 230 ft).The parallel platforms flanking the main playing area are each 95 metres (312 ft) long. The walls of these platforms stand 8 metres (26 ft) high; set high up in the centre of each of these walls are rings carved with intertwined feathered serpents.At the base of the high interior walls are slanted benches with sculpted panels of teams of ball players. In one panel, one of the players has been decapitated; the wound emits streams of blood in the form of wriggling snakes.At one end of the Great Ball Court is the North Temple, also known as the Temple of the Bearded Man (Templo del Hombre Barbado). This small masonry building has detailed bas relief carving on the inner walls, including a center figure that has carving under his chin that resembles facial hair. At the south end is another, much bigger temple, but in ruins.\nBuilt into the east wall are the Temples of the Jaguar. The Upper Temple of the Jaguar overlooks the ball court and has an entrance guarded by two, large columns carved in the familiar feathered serpent motif. Inside there is a large mural, much destroyed, which depicts a battle scene.\nIn the entrance to the Lower Temple of the Jaguar, which opens behind the ball court, is another Jaguar throne, similar to the one in the inner temple of El Castillo, except that it is well worn and missing paint or other decoration. The outer columns and the walls inside the temple are covered with elaborate bas-relief carvings.\n\n\n===== Additional structures =====\nThe Tzompantli, or Skull Platform (Plataforma de los Cr\u00e1neos), shows the clear cultural influence of the central Mexican Plateau. Unlike the tzompantli of the highlands, however, the skulls were impaled vertically rather than horizontally as at Tenochtitlan.\n\nThe Platform of the Eagles and the Jaguars (Plataforma de \u00c1guilas y Jaguares) is immediately to the east of the Great Ballcourt. It is built in a combination Maya and Toltec styles, with a staircase ascending each of its four sides. The sides are decorated with panels depicting eagles and jaguars consuming human hearts.This Platform of Venus is dedicated to the planet Venus. In its interior archaeologists discovered a collection of large cones carved out of stone, the purpose of which is unknown. This platform is located north of El Castillo, between it and the Cenote Sagrado.The Temple of the Tables is the northernmost of a series of buildings to the east of El Castillo. Its name comes from a series of altars at the top of the structure that are supported by small carved figures of men with upraised arms, called \"atlantes.\"\nThe Steam Bath is a unique building with three parts: a waiting gallery, a water bath, and a steam chamber that operated by means of heated stones.\nSacbe Number One is a causeway that leads to the Cenote Sagrado, is the largest and most elaborate at Chichen Itza. This \"white road\" is 270 metres (890 ft) long with an average width of 9 metres (30 ft). It begins at a low wall a few metres from the Platform of Venus. According to archaeologists there once was an extensive building with columns at the beginning of the road.\n\n\n===== Sacred Cenote =====\n\nThe Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is a limestone plain, with no rivers or streams. The region is pockmarked with natural sinkholes, called cenotes, which expose the water table to the surface. One of the most impressive of these is the Cenote Sagrado, which is 60 metres (200 ft) in diameter and surrounded by sheer cliffs that drop to the water table some 27 metres (89 ft) below.\nThe Cenote Sagrado was a place of pilgrimage for ancient Maya people who, according to ethnohistoric sources, would conduct sacrifices during times of drought. Archaeological investigations support this as thousands of objects have been removed from the bottom of the cenote, including material such as gold, carved jade, copal, pottery, flint, obsidian, shell, wood, rubber, cloth, as well as skeletons of children and men.\n\n\n===== Temple of the Warriors =====\n\nThe Temple of the Warriors complex consists of a large stepped pyramid fronted and flanked by rows of carved columns depicting warriors. This complex is analogous to Temple B at the Toltec capital of Tula, and indicates some form of cultural contact between the two regions. The one at Chichen Itza, however, was constructed on a larger scale. At the top of the stairway on the pyramid's summit (and leading towards the entrance of the pyramid's temple) is a Chac Mool.\nThis temple encases or entombs a former structure called The Temple of the Chac Mool. The archeological expedition and restoration of this building was done by the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1925 to 1928. A key member of this restoration was Earl H. Morris who published the work from this expedition in two volumes entitled Temple of the Warriors.\n\n\n===== Group of a Thousand Columns =====\nAlong the south wall of the Temple of Warriors are a series of what are today exposed columns, although when the city was inhabited these would have supported an extensive roof system. The columns are in three distinct sections: A west group, that extends the lines of the front of the Temple of Warriors. A north group runs along the south wall of the Temple of Warriors and contains pillars with carvings of soldiers in bas-relief;\nA northeast group, which apparently formed a small temple at the southeast corner of the Temple of Warriors, contains a rectangular decorated with carvings of people or gods, as well as animals and serpents. The northeast column temple also covers a small marvel of engineering, a channel that funnels all the rainwater from the complex some 40 metres (130 ft) away to a rejollada, a former cenote.\nTo the south of the Group of a Thousand Columns is a group of three, smaller, interconnected buildings. The Temple of the Carved Columns is a small elegant building that consists of a front gallery with an inner corridor that leads to an altar with a Chac Mool. There are also numerous columns with rich, bas-relief carvings of some 40 personages.\nA section of the upper fa\u00e7ade with a motif of x's and o's is displayed in front of the structure. The Temple of the Small Tables which is an unrestored mound. And the Thompson's Temple (referred to in some sources as Palace of Ahau Balam Kauil ), a small building with two levels that has friezes depicting Jaguars (balam in Maya) as well as glyphs of the Maya god Kahuil.\n\n\n===== El Mercado =====\nThis square structure anchors the southern end of the Temple of Warriors complex. It is so named for the shelf of stone that surrounds a large gallery and patio that early explorers theorized was used to display wares as in a marketplace. Today, archaeologists believe that its purpose was more ceremonial than commercial.\n\n\n==== Osario Group ====\nSouth of the North Group is a smaller platform that has many important structures, several of which appear to be oriented toward the second largest cenote at Chichen Itza, Xtoloc.\n\nThe Osario itself, like El Castillo, is a step-pyramid temple dominating its platform, only on a smaller scale. Like its larger neighbor, it has four sides with staircases on each side. There is a temple on top, but unlike El Castillo, at the center is an opening into the pyramid which leads to a natural cave 12 metres (39 ft) below. Edward H. Thompson excavated this cave in the late 19th century, and because he found several skeletons and artifacts such as jade beads, he named the structure The High Priests' Temple. Archaeologists today believe neither that the structure was a tomb nor that the personages buried in it were priests.\nThe Temple of Xtoloc is a recently restored temple outside the Osario Platform is. It overlooks the other large cenote at Chichen Itza, named after the Maya word for iguana, \"Xtoloc.\" The temple contains a series of pilasters carved with images of people, as well as representations of plants, birds and mythological scenes.\nBetween the Xtoloc temple and the Osario are several aligned structures: The Platform of Venus (which is similar in design to the structure of the same name next to El Castillo), the Platform of the Tombs, and a small, round structure that is unnamed. These three structures were constructed in a row extending from the Osario. Beyond them the Osario platform terminates in a wall, which contains an opening to a sacbe that runs several hundred feet to the Xtoloc temple.\nSouth of the Osario, at the boundary of the platform, there are two small buildings that archaeologists believe were residences for important personages. These have been named as the House of the Metates and the House of the Mestizas.\n\n\n==== Casa Colorada Group ====\nSouth of the Osario Group is another small platform that has several structures that are among the oldest in the Chichen Itza archaeological zone.\nThe Casa Colorada (Spanish for \"Red House\") is one of the best preserved buildings at Chichen Itza. Its Maya name is Chichanchob, which according to INAH may mean \"small holes\". In one chamber there are extensive carved hieroglyphs that mention rulers of Chichen Itza and possibly of the nearby city of Ek Balam, and contain a Maya date inscribed which correlates to 869 AD, one of the oldest such dates found in all of Chichen Itza.\nIn 2009, INAH restored a small ball court that adjoined the back wall of the Casa Colorada.While the Casa Colorada is in a good state of preservation, other buildings in the group, with one exception, are decrepit mounds. One building is half standing, named La Casa del Venado (House of the Deer). This building's name has been long used by the local Maya, and some authors mention that it was named after a deer painting over stucco that doesn't exist anymore.\n\n\n==== Central Group ====\n\nLas Monjas is one of the more notable structures at Chichen Itza. It is a complex of Terminal Classic buildings constructed in the Puuc architectural style. The Spanish named this complex Las Monjas (\"The Nuns\" or \"The Nunnery\") but it was actually a governmental palace. Just to the east is a small temple (known as the La Iglesia, \"The Church\") decorated with elaborate masks.The Las Monjas group is distinguished by its concentration of hieroglyphic texts dating to the Late to Terminal Classic. These texts frequently mention a ruler by the name of K\u02bcak\u02bcupakal.El Caracol (\"The Snail\") is located to the north of Las Monjas. It is a round building on a large square platform. It gets its name from the stone spiral staircase inside. The structure, with its unusual placement on the platform and its round shape (the others are rectangular, in keeping with Maya practice), is theorized to have been a proto-observatory with doors and windows aligned to astronomical events, specifically around the path of Venus as it traverses the heavens.Akab Dzib is located to the east of the Caracol. The name means, in Yucatec Mayan, \"Dark Writing\"; \"dark\" in the sense of \"mysterious\". An earlier name of the building, according to a translation of glyphs in the Casa Colorada, is Wa(k)wak Puh Ak Na, \"the flat house with the excessive number of chambers,\" and it was the home of the administrator of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, kokom Yahawal Cho\u02bc K\u02bcak\u02bc.INAH completed a restoration of the building in 2007. It is relatively short, only 6 metres (20 ft) high, and is 50 metres (160 ft) in length and 15 metres (49 ft) wide. The long, western-facing fa\u00e7ade has seven doorways. The eastern fa\u00e7ade has only four doorways, broken by a large staircase that leads to the roof. This apparently was the front of the structure, and looks out over what is today a steep, dry, cenote.\nThe southern end of the building has one entrance. The door opens into a small chamber and on the opposite wall is another doorway, above which on the lintel are intricately carved glyphs\u2014the \"mysterious\" or \"obscure\" writing that gives the building its name today. Under the lintel in the doorjamb is another carved panel of a seated figure surrounded by more glyphs. Inside one of the chambers, near the ceiling, is a painted hand print.\n\n\n==== Old Chichen ====\n\nOld Chichen (or Chich\u00e9n Viejo in Spanish) is the name given to a group of structures to the south of the central site, where most of the Puuc-style architecture of the city is concentrated. It includes the Initial Series Group, the Phallic Temple, the Platform of the Great Turtle, the Temple of the Owls, and the Temple of the Monkeys.\n\n\n==== Other structures ====\nChichen Itza also has a variety of other structures densely packed in the ceremonial center of about 5 square kilometres (1.9 sq mi) and several outlying subsidiary sites.\n\n\n==== Caves of Balankanche ====\nApproximately 4 km (2.5 mi) south east of the Chichen Itza archaeological zone are a network of sacred caves known as Balankanche (Spanish: Gruta de Balankanche), Balamka\u02bcanche\u02bc in Yucatec Maya). In the caves, a large selection of ancient pottery and idols may be seen still in the positions where they were left in pre-Columbian times.\nThe location of the cave has been well known in modern times. Edward Thompson and Alfred Tozzer visited it in 1905. A.S. Pearse and a team of biologists explored the cave in 1932 and 1936. E. Wyllys Andrews IV also explored the cave in the 1930s. Edwin Shook and R.E. Smith explored the cave on behalf of the Carnegie Institution in 1954, and dug several trenches to recover potsherds and other artifacts. Shook determined that the cave had been inhabited over a long period, at least from the Preclassic to the post-conquest era.On 15 September 1959, Jos\u00e9 Humberto G\u00f3mez, a local guide, discovered a false wall in the cave. Behind it he found an extended network of caves with significant quantities of undisturbed archaeological remains, including pottery and stone-carved censers, stone implements and jewelry. INAH converted the cave into an underground museum, and the objects after being catalogued were returned to their original place so visitors can see them in situ.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nChichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico; in 2017 it was estimated to have received 2.1 million visitors.\n\nTourism has been a factor at Chichen Itza for more than a century. John Lloyd Stephens, who popularized the Maya Yucat\u00e1n in the public's imagination with his book Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, inspired many to make a pilgrimage to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Even before the book was published, Benjamin Norman and Baron Emanuel von Friedrichsthal traveled to Chichen after meeting Stephens, and both published the results of what they found. Friedrichsthal was the first to photograph Chichen Itza, using the recently invented daguerreotype.After Edward Thompson in 1894 purchased the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, which included Chichen Itza, he received a constant stream of visitors. In 1910 he announced his intention to construct a hotel on his property, but abandoned those plans, probably because of the Mexican Revolution.\nIn the early 1920s, a group of Yucatecans, led by writer/photographer Francisco Gomez Rul, began working toward expanding tourism to Yucat\u00e1n. They urged Governor Felipe Carrillo Puerto to build roads to the more famous monuments, including Chichen Itza. In 1923, Governor Carrillo Puerto officially opened the highway to Chichen Itza. Gomez Rul published one of the first guidebooks to Yucat\u00e1n and the ruins.\nGomez Rul's son-in-law, Fernando Barbachano Peon (a grandnephew of former Yucat\u00e1n Governor Miguel Barbachano), started Yucat\u00e1n's first official tourism business in the early 1920s. He began by meeting passengers who arrived by steamship at Progreso, the port north of M\u00e9rida, and persuading them to spend a week in Yucat\u00e1n, after which they would catch the next steamship to their next destination. In his first year Barbachano Peon reportedly was only able to convince seven passengers to leave the ship and join him on a tour. In the mid-1920s Barbachano Peon persuaded Edward Thompson to sell 5 acres (20,000 m2) next to Chichen for a hotel. In 1930, the Mayaland Hotel opened, just north of the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, which had been taken over by the Carnegie Institution.In 1944, Barbachano Peon purchased all of the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, including Chichen Itza, from the heirs of Edward Thompson. Around that same time the Carnegie Institution completed its work at Chichen Itza and abandoned the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, which Barbachano turned into another seasonal hotel.\nIn 1972, Mexico enacted the Ley Federal Sobre Monumentos y Zonas Arqueol\u00f3gicas, Art\u00edsticas e Hist\u00f3ricas (Federal Law over Monuments and Archeological, Artistic and Historic Sites) that put all the nation's pre-Columbian monuments, including those at Chichen Itza, under federal ownership. There were now hundreds, if not thousands, of visitors every year to Chichen Itza, and more were expected with the development of the Canc\u00fan resort area to the east.\nIn the 1980s, Chichen Itza began to receive an influx of visitors on the day of the spring equinox. Today several thousand show up to see the light-and-shadow effect on the Temple of Kukulcan in which the feathered serpent god appears to crawl down the side of the pyramid. Tour guides will also demonstrate a unique the acoustical effect at Chichen Itza: a handclap before the in front of the staircase the El Castillo pyramid will produce by an echo that resembles the chirp of a bird, similar to that of the quetzal as investigated by Declercq.Chichen Itza, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the second-most visited of Mexico's archaeological sites. The archaeological site draws many visitors from the popular tourist resort of Canc\u00fan, who make a day trip on tour buses.\nIn 2007, Chichen Itza's El Castillo was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World after a worldwide vote. Despite the fact that the vote was sponsored by a commercial enterprise, and that its methodology was criticized, the vote was embraced by government and tourism officials in Mexico who projected that as a result of the publicity the number of tourists to Chichen would double by 2012. The ensuing publicity re-ignited debate in Mexico over the ownership of the site, which culminated on 29 March 2010 when the state of Yucat\u00e1n purchased the land upon which the most recognized monuments rest from owner Hans Juergen Thies Barbachano.INAH, which manages the site, has closed a number of monuments to public access. While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers.  Climbing access to El Castillo was closed after a San Diego, California, woman fell to her death in 2006.\n\n\n== Photo gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAsteroid 100456 Chichn Itza\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of Mesoamerican pyramids\nMaya-Toltec controversy at Chichen Itza\nTikal\nUxmal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHolmes, William H.

          "The ruins and history is absolutely fascinating. Doing a bit of research before hand to get up to date on the history of the Maya gave me a better appreciation for the site. For what it is - 5 stars. Have to remove a star for the absolutely insane amount of hustlers trying to",

          "We spent a few hours at Chichen Itza in August 2019. The site is quite extensive and there is lots to see. However, in order to get the most out of the site you will need a guide. We visited the site with Cancun Adventures on a private tour - this was a very good way to see",
          "We are stayed in Riu Carribe Cancun and we bought excursion to Chichen Itza with TUI. They were picked up us from this resort and provided extremely experienced guide - Stefano. Meeting was the early morning tour as you're able to avoid the heat and crowd. Our tour guide gave us",

          "We booked through Viator and our early morning tour was run by Amigo Tours! It was a fantastic tour - it took 3 hours from our base in Playa Del Carmen and back though well worth it. Our Tour Guide Marco was superb, giving my family and all other english understanding people",
          "The tour was well organized ans we travlled to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, the Ik Kil cenote, and Valladolid. I was surprised to see that there was more buildings of interest here and we have a very informative guide. The Ball Game area was very interesting. We then travelled Valladolid",
          "We did an early morning tour which included pick up and drop off, lunch, tour guide and entry. Great to tick off the bucket list. Highly recommend going very early to avoid the crowd and get some great pics. It started to get really busy and hot about 10-11am when we were",
          "Quintana Roo and Yucatan States in Mexico are covered with numerous ancient Mayan ruins. Some if the sites are well preserved while other are just a pile of rocks. Chitchen Itza is in excellent shape and has been well preserved over the years. As an amateur Archeologist this",
          "The site is great , along with the cenote.. I was amazed by the science the mayans had developed eons ago. It was raining half way thru but worth the visit. The vendors can be nasty to foreigners (imitating you etc). That ruins it a little bit. Also try to avoid some of the",

          "This is the top Mayan site in MesoAmerica in terms of excavated and restored structures - all in a relatively compact area. Easy to navigate. A tour guide is a must but combine that with some prior research. If you wish a more hands, less restored and less restrictive site",
          "The ruins are very well maintained and definitely worth a visit. It would be a great idea to have a tour guide to show you around the ruins. Sunscreen and bug spray are strongly recommend but if you forgot to bring them they have them at their souvenir shops.",
          "Pictures don\u2019t do this justice at all. I think if your going to go to Mexico and aren\u2019t planning going back anytime soon you should go see this newly added \u201cwonder of the world\u201d there is so much history to learn and it\u2019s beautiful. I stayed in playa del Carmen and it is a 2 hour",
          "This Mayan ruins are not the best ones in Mexico but are the most visited. Long lines of tourists waiting to go in at all times; inside you walk in a place with vendors on both sides, everywhere.the whole area isn\u2019t in a good maintenance condition. Sorry but I can\u2019t recommend",

          "It\u2019s one of the wonders of the world for a reason. It can get overcrowded and really hot, so take water with you and a hat as there is minimal shade. There are a lot of souvenir sellers so if that\u2019s something you are interested in you can find it there. Its a 2-3 hr trip at most",
          "Why on earth would you go to Yucatan and not go here at least once? It is an amazing location filled with interesting history",
          "After much thought we decided to drive ourselves to chichen itza and it didn\u2019t disappoint. We left at 7.30 from playa de Carmen and it took 2 hours to drive. The ruins were just amazing and definitely worth visiting. Visiting first thing in the morning was definitely the best",

          "We had been to Chichen Itza 20 years ago but we wanted to bring our children so we booked a tour including a cenote visit. The bus journey was a bit of a pain as you have to wend your way through all the hotel complexes picking people up. Chichen is just as impressive as last",

          "I am glad I went, but it was very hot. I would not go in August again. I was very surprised that the ruins were in good condition , better than I expected. I am glad we had a tour guide. He was very knowledgeable regarding the history of the Mayans...He said his mother was a",

          "This place is beautiful definitely recommend going we went with a 2&4 year old both really enjoyed the day. The tui trip we went on does leave early but it\u2019s definitely worth it for how quite it is",
          "Very interesting place. Tickets cost 480 pesos per person, if you drive there you will need to pay 80 pesos in parking also. The ruins are very interesting, with signs in English and Spanish throughout the site informing you on each of the buildings. There is a bit of shade",
          "Loved this place. Was a lovely day out. Also if you want to visit buy you souvenirs here, they are really cheap but exact same as shops. Also local people make some amazing statues, we bought 2 for 10 dollars.in the shops near the resorts they wanted 15 dollars each.",
          "If you can get there, do go. Stunning site. We got there for when it opened to avoid the heat and the crowds. Well worth an early start. 3 of us shared a guide with a couple who were waiting at the entrance and it was well worth having a guide.",
          "We booked the VIP Chichen Itza and Cenote Ikkil excursion through our Carnival cruise ship. I had read many reviews so knew to expect a long ride there and back from the port and that it would be a whirlwind tour of both sites. In my opinion (and my wife's!), it was well worth",
          "The ruins are cool, I'll give it that. The flee market with all the pushy salesman is ridiculous. It takes quite the drive to get there for maybe an hour worth of sightseeing. Maybe you could stay longer if you are tolerant to 120\u00b0 weather.",
          "We stayed in hotel Mayaland with its own entrance which was perfect. They arranged a private guide for us for approximately 35 US dollars. We went in at 8 am when the place is not yet crowded, not yet too hot and all the vendors are still setting up and not harrassing you. The",
          "Brilliant trip here, we learnt so much and saw lots more besides the ruins. Our guide was brilliant and has lots of other photos too. Just be prepared for the heat. There\u2019s little shade so if your tour guide offers you an umbrella for the shade, take it. Pack light but make sure",
          "Of course you have to experience this sight! Enter it and you step in history. Mayan ruins wonderfully kept. Amazing area. The pyramid is a beauty! Protect yourselves with cover ups and hats because it is soo hot. Buy fast access to bit the crowds. So many sweet people around",
          "Amazing visit, the place screams history and if you have the right guide - this place comes to life. Definitely worth a visit and would highly recommend. Only thing I could comment on is there are too many souvenir stalls, makes the pathways to the main attraction a bit tacky.",
          "Our tour guide, Victor, has been doing this for 45 years and his knowledge was amazing. I cannot recommend the 5am tour any more highly. Watching the sun rise over the Mayan ruins was awe-inspiring to say the least. It is worth every penny.",
          "We visited Chichen Itza as part of a tour including a cenote swim, lunch and chichen itza. It was a lot of fun, but a long (and very hot) day for our kids. Our tour provided lots of drinks and even had umbrellas for everyone to use at Chichen (don\u2019t be too proud to take one! It",

Of course there are lots of tourists and there are a lot of vendors, just be prepared for that before you go; you would not",
          "Definitely one of the wonders of the world. As everyone says, try to get there early to avoid the crowds and the heat and the vendors (the vendors are still setting up if you get there early and so they don't hassle you to buy stuff). The ruins are stunning and I loved the way",

          "We had an excellent tour guide who came with the day trip. I thought the plaza would be packed having seen the amount of coaches but not at all. We didn't succeed in getting a photo of the temple with no people in it ..but we were very close! The carvings are a little difficult",
          "The Chitzen Itza ancient Mayan tour was sooo AMAZING! This tour was very informative, educational, and spiritual. This is definitely a MUST see attraction in Cancun Mexico. It's one of those sights you can't just see all in one day. If you have kids, I would suggest taking them",

          "We drove ourselves and arrived just before opening time (8am) and got round and out by 10. This had two huge benefits (a) it's cooler then and (b) it's much less busy. We enjoyed wandering round the ancient ruins and looking at the stone carvings. The buildings are well",
          "We\u2019ve been wanting to visit Chichen Itza for years and it was a large part of our motivation in coming to Mexico in the first place. It is amazing; and you really do need a guide to bring it to life. The site itself leaves a lot to be desired. No real signage or interpretation",
          "My son and I went on an express trip booked via Bahia Principe Tours. That began with an early morning start from the Tulum Lobby to get there around 10am. The journey took 2.5 hours and with me being over 180cm tall it was a real squeeze fitting into the back seats of a 15",

          "The pyramid condition is like it was built yesterday. So many things you can learn for Mayas and so many questions that can not been answered. You will hear groups clapping their hands, just be quite and you will hear the jaguar screaming. You must see also the field that they",
          "Early pick up from hotel is worth it! 5am!!! Means you get to Chichen Itza for 8am when it opens so it is not too hot and is quiet. It soon gets busy, when we left at 10 it was getting crowded, it would ruin the experience i feel.",
          "Beautiful ancient Mayan history is worth a day trip from the coastal resorts of Quintana Roo. The powerful history of the great Mayan people two centuries ago gives us hope, but also pause on how civilizations go through cycles. Definitely worth a visit especially during the",
          "Chichen Itza is very much advertised and, naturally, most popular Mayan ruins. As a result, most crowded and most commercialised, too. I am only glad that Chichen Itza was the first of the ruins I visited, otherwise the impression would have been even worse. Very",
          "These ruins are amazing! We drove from Cancun (2.5 hours on the toll road), stayed at Mayaland, and then took a 5 a.m. sunrise tour with Abel, which got us in to see everything in various stages of lighting and BEFORE the crowds. Well worth it! We were back at the hotel at 8 and",
          "Super, super angry about the money I wasted. After getting on a bus and basically hearded like cattle with the guide telling us vominous after every minute we get on this bus.... Then the whole time he is giving us the tour he mentions how much it is going to rain so they will",
          "Absolutely amazing place to visit with it\u2019s history, we had Ricardo as our tour guide who told us everything there was, we got there early to be first through the gates and paid off, we left at about 12:30pm and the queues at the gate were unreal. Make sure you bring some sort",
          "My family and I travelled to see this amazing Chichen Itza with guided tour Nachos who was very good and knowledgable. We are being looked after with Luis our driver as well. Though we were part of the group they made sure we are not left out . Highly recommend to have the tour",
          "The tour of Chichen Itza with tour guide (Lewis) or Louise (male) was very bad. The tour guide talked non stop, very fast the whole way. He believed in the religion of the Mayan's and at one point when he was trying to read a name from his list of tourists, he said very loud",
          "First of all, this is out in the middle of nowhere. I say that as we did not know and it was a 2.5 hour drive each way from Playa Del Carmen, Riviera Maya. That is worth knowing but it is worth the drive. I would recommend going on an approved tour as we learnt so much",
          "This is an absolutely beautiful, magical place. The only problem is every available space is lined with local vendors. I mean, hundreds and hundreds. They were interrupting our group while our guide was talking. They yelled at us and crowded us. It was really uncomfortable.",
          "To start the first time you see the Pyramid of Chichen Itza it is breathtaking. One thing I recommend is you take a guided tour. It\u2019s one thing to see the Mayan ruins and it\u2019s another to actually learn and appreciate all the cool things about the ruins. Not to spoil everything,",
          "Fantastic bit of history to see, it took us 3 hours to get there but felt it was worth it for the day trip and to see the sights and the area was amazing. We had a brief 45 minute tour which was arranged via our Tui reps which was really informative and helpful. Glad we went",
          "Chichen Itza is something that cannot be missed if you are close by. Although we did not get a tour, your visit may be more worth while if you get a guide. I would recommend you to arrive at 8 before the tour buses arrive from the resorts and before the sun becomes too hot.",
          "While vacationing in Playa del Carmen we did a day trip to the ruins. Awesome!!!! It was hot and muggy but still enjoyed the day. There was 9 of us..2 of them kids. Very interesting culture. There were also vendors selling really great culture items. We bought some souvenir\u2019s to",

          "Let me begin by saying that Chichen Itza was beyond amazing for me. It is worth the travel time, the price to visit, the heat, and the normal irritations of the plethora of vendors. However, I am writing to share that when it comes to your money being stolen and your time being",
          "My husband and I visited Chichen Itza on our recent trip to Mexico, and I am very glad we did. It was perhaps not the most stunning or awe-inspiring thing I've ever seen, but the history behind it is truly fascinating. We went with a tour company, so we had a guide who was able",
          "It goes without saying that the site is amazing and fascinating. Completely unmissable. Even at 8am when it first opened, there was a very long line of people queuing. Luckily, my taxi arrived early (around 7.30am) and I was at the front of the queue. I was also on my own and",

          "This place is fantastic to see. I went on a TUI trip and the local guide was very knowledgeable, explaining the purpose of all the buildings. We also arrived early, we were picked up from the hotel at 4.30am, but this was worth it as it was reasonably quiet during our visit",
          "I don\u2019t suggest anyone to go with a tour group, just take a private car from town and drive there early morning. In that way you are much more flexible where and when you want to go. I took a car from playa del Carmen, took 2 hours drive, after Cenotes and a little Mexican town",

        "wiki": "The guayabera () also known in Mexico as Camisa de Yucat\u00e1n (Yucat\u00e1n Shirt) is a men's summer shirt, worn outside the trousers, distinguished by two vertical rows of closely sewn pleats running the length of the front and back of the shirt. Typically made of linen, silk, or cotton, and appropriate for hot or humid weather, guayaberas are popular in Cuba, the Caribbean (especially the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico), Mexico, Central America, South America, Southeast Asia, the south of Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe design of a typical guayabera is distinguished by several details:\n\nLong or short sleeves, the more common being the short-sleeved version, having a cuffed sleeve with a single decorative button.\nEither two or four patch pockets and two vertical rows of alforzas (fine, tiny pleats, usually ten, sewn closely together) run down the front and three down the back of the shirt. The pockets are detailed with alforzas that are identical to, and aligned with, the alforzas on the body of the shirt.\nThe top of each pocket is usually adorned with a matching shirt button, as are the bottoms of the alforza pleats. Vertical rows of adjusting buttons are often used at the bottom hem. While most versions of the design have no placket covering the buttons, a few newer designs do.\nSome shirt designs include slits on either side, and these include two or three buttons. The bottom has a straight hem, and is never tucked into the trousers.Though traditionally worn in white and pastels, guayaberas are now available in many solid colors. Black guayaberas, embroidered with colorful flowers and with French cuffs, have for many decades been extremely popular in Mexico and are considered formalwear in some situations.Mexican guayaberas often use complicated embroidery as a supplement to the traditional alforzas. This style originated in M\u00e9rida, Mexico.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe exact origin of the garment is unknown, although some sources attribute the shirt to the people of the Philippines who introduced the design to Mexico. Specifically, the design is believed to be from the lace-like white Philippine barong Tagalog, which has documented origins in the Philippines prior to the arrival of the Spanish. It made its way to Cuba through Mexico via the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade (AD 1565 to 1815).\n\nSome scholars dispute the Philippine origin based on perceived design differences. The barong traditionally does not have pockets and has an intricate U-shaped embroidery around the chest (the pechera) which is mostly absent in Cuban guayaberas. Guayaberas are also made from linen or cotton, and not the expensive pi\u00f1a or abac\u00e1 sheer fabrics used in formal barong (although informal barong worn by the lower classes in the Philippines use common opaque fabrics like linen).However, guayaberas in Mexico also have chest designs like pleats and embroidery similar to the barong (and in contrast to Cuban guayaberas); and they can range from having no pockets, to having one, two, or four. This is the reason why Mexicans also claim that it originated from either the state of Veracruz or the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. In Mexico, the same basic style is also known as the \"camisa de Yucat\u00e1n\" (Yucat\u00e1n shirt) or \"wedding shirt\".Regardless, a clearer line of evidence is that guayaberas are actually also referred to as \"filipinas\" in Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico, with the former regarded as a variant of the latter. The only difference between the two is the type of collar used. Filipinas have a collar similar to the Nehru or mandarin-style (a style known as the baro cerrada in the 19th-century Philippines), while guayaberas have a more typical spread collar. Both filipinas and the derivative guayaberas were the traditional everyday men's shirts in Yucat\u00e1n since the mid-19th century, before they were replaced by western shirts in the early 20th century. The white filipina shirt is still regarded as the traditional formal dress for men in Yucat\u00e1n, along with the terno for women (cf. traje de Mestiza of the Philippines). In particular, white filipinas are the traditional shirts worn for the jarana Yucateca dance, paired with white trousers. This suggests an origin from the Philippines that entered Mexico early during the colonial period through Yucat\u00e1n then to Cuba, where it was later adapted to local fashion and materials.Cubans also claim the guayabera originated from Cuba. Cuban literature refers to the shirt from 1893, and documentary evidence mentions the shirt in Cuba as early as 1880. The Cuban origin story tells of a poor countryside seamstress sewing large patch-pockets onto her husband's shirts for carrying guava (guayabas) from the field. In another version of the story, in 1709 Spanish immigrants from Granada, Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Rodr\u00edguez and his wife Encarnaci\u00f3n N\u00fa\u00f1ez Garc\u00eda arrived in Sancti Spiritus, located along the Yayabo River. Jos\u00e9 asked his wife to make him a shirt with long sleeves and four large pockets to store his cigars and belongings while he worked. Because it was easy to make and useful, it soon became a popular garment in use in that region. Another belief is that the name guayabera is said to have originated from the word yayabero, the nickname for those who lived near the Yayabo River in Cuba.\n\n\n== Wear and use ==\n\nThe guayabera is often worn in formal contexts, such as offices and weddings. In Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, guayaberas are part of the traditional wear for men and may be considered formalwear. In 2010, Cuba reinstated the guayabera as the \"official formal dress garment\".\n\n\n== Political symbolism ==\n\nGuayaberas have been worn extensively by a number of Latin American political leaders, including Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Cesar Chavez, Carlos Pr\u00edo Socarr\u00e1s, and Fidel Castro. This is often interpreted as a sign of the wearer's affiliation with populist political positions. Michael Manley, populist Jamaican prime minister, specifically advocated for the guayabera as an anti-colonialist mode of dress, and conversely the shirt was later banned in Parliament by the conservative Jamaica Labour Party. Similarly, Mexican left-wing populist Luis Echeverr\u00eda advocated for its use in Mexico in part to symbolize rejection of European and American-style business suits.U.S. presidents, including Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Barack Obama, have worn the shirts as a sign of solidarity when visiting the Cuban community in Miami and when attending Latin American summits. Visiting politicians are sometimes given the shirts by Cuban American or Latin American political leaders.\n\n\n== Similar shirts and alternative names ==\nA variety of similar, lightweight dress shirts exist in other tropical countries. These include:\n\nIn the Dominican Republic: guayaberas are referred to as \"chacabana\".\nIn Guyana: a similar or identical shirt is called a \"shirt-jac\".\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, physicians often wear them because of their practicality; one pocket for pens, one for a prescription pad, another for a stethoscope, etc.\nIn Jamaica: the guayabera is called a \"bush jacket\".\nIn the Philippines: the barong Tagalog shirt has some features which are similar to the guayabera: it is long-sleeved, light, traditionally white, and worn without being tucked in. However, the most traditional styles are decorated with \"U\" shaped embroidery (called the pechera), rather than the guayabera's straight pleats, and lack pockets. It is also traditionally made of hand-woven, fine, translucent pi\u00f1a or jusi fiber, rather than linen.\nIn America: the Western shirts with pointed yokes and elaborate embroidery were directly copied from the guayaberas of 19th century Mexican vaqueros. These serve as the national costume of the Southwestern United States.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMant\u00f3n de Manila\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8me\u027ei\u00f0a] (listen)) is the capital and largest city in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of M\u00e9rida, which includes the city and the areas around it.\nAccording to the 2015 census, the population of M\u00e9rida was 892,363, ranking 14th among the most populous Mexican cities. The Greater M\u00e9rida metropolitan area includes the municipalities of M\u00e9rida, Um\u00e1n and Kanas\u00edn and had a population of 1,035,238 in the 2010 census. The municipality's area is 858.41 km2 (331.43 sq mi). Among the four cities that share the same name around the world, it is the largest -the other three being in Spain, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\nThe city, like much of the state, has heavy Mayan, Spanish, French, British, Lebanese and to a lesser extent Dutch influences. M\u00e9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large city in Mexico. The Maya are approximately 60% of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were three Spanish conquistadors named \"Francisco de Montejo\": Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\" (\"The Lieutenant\", the eldest); Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" (\"The Boy\", his son); and Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\" (\"The Nephew\"). M\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by Montejo y Le\u00f3n (\"el Mozo\") and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.  It was built on the site of the Maya city of T'h\u00f3 (/d\u0325\u02bc\u03c7\u00f8\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/is\u0283kan'si\u03c7\u0153/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids.\nCarved Maya stones from ancient T'ho were used to build the Spanish colonial buildings which are numerous in downtown M\u00e9rida; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. Much of M\u00e9rida's architecture from the colonial period through the 18th century and 19th century is still standing in the centro historico of the city. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city intended to protect the Peninsular and Criollo residents from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya. Several of the old Spanish city gates survive, but modern M\u00e9rida has expanded well beyond the old city walls.\nLate in the 19th century and the early 20th Century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the production of henequ\u00e9n. For a brief period, around the turn of the 20th century, M\u00e9rida was said to house more millionaires than any other city in the world. The result of this concentration of wealth can still be seen today. Many large and elaborate homes still line the main avenue called Paseo de Montejo, though few are occupied today by individual families. Many of these homes have been restored and now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Incheon. These first Korean migrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nCompleted in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala, \u201cLas Casas Gemelas\u201d (The Twin Houses), are two side by side French and Spanish style mansions that remain from the early 20th Century. They are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. They are owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted such luminaries as Princecess Grace and Prince Ranieri of Monaco, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.M\u00e9rida has one of the largest centro hist\u00f3rico districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of M\u00e9rida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n).\nIn June 2007, M\u00e9rida moved its city museum to the renovated Post Office building next to the downtown market. The Museum of the City of M\u00e9rida houses important artifacts from the city's history, as well as an art gallery. M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States, in April 2014.\nM\u00e9rida is the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, as well as the capital city of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. In recent years, important science competitions and World events have been held in M\u00e9rida \u2013 FITA Archery World Cup Finals, the International Cosmic Ray Conference, a Physics Olympiad, etc.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucatan economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average. Since M\u00e9rida is the capital city of Yucatan and one of the largest cities in this section of Mexico, region-based urbanization is highly influential, in comparison to city-based urbanization. As the capital city of the state of Yucatan, M\u00e9rida has its advantages, \"Cities, particularly capital cities, are where the vast majority of modern productive activities are concentrated in the developing world and where the vast majority of paid employment opportunities are located.\" Many resources have been allocated to this region, but not everyone prospers with the influx of these resources. High rates of urban poverty can be attributed to the rapid development of these cities and resource and service allocation can be disproportionate between the rich and the poor of the area. Due to the rapid expansion of these cities, there is uneven distribution of services among members of the community. Due to the developing economy, based on urbanization of the city, high rates between the social classes are present; notable zones throughout the city are visible marking where the upper or lower class are present.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.  To the east is the state of Quintana Roo, to the west is the state of Campeche, to the north is the Gulf of Mexico, and far to the south is the state of Chiapas. The city is also located in the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only 30 feet (9 m) above sea level.  The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields.  Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (underground springs and rivers) are found across the state.  M\u00e9rida has a centro hist\u00f3rico typical of colonial Spanish cities.  The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east/west and even-numbered streets running north/south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city.  The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico area is becoming increasingly popular with Americans and other expatriates who are rescuing and restoring the classic colonial structures.  In 2007 the Los Angeles Times recently noted this surge of interest in rescuing M\u00e9rida's historic downtown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F), ranging from 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) in January to 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between  18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) in January to 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n \n\nM\u00e9rida is the constitutional capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. State government officials reside here. The municipal or local government is invested under the authority of a City Council (Ayuntamiento) which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located at the city's downtown. \nThe City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s\u00edndicos). The current Mayor is Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha who took office on September 1, 2018.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has been nicknamed \"The White City\" (La Ciudad Blanca), though the exact origin of this moniker is not clear. Some explanations include the common color of its old buildings painted and decorated with \"cal\" or the fact that the residents keep the city particularly clean. M\u00e9rida was named after the Spanish town of the same name, originally (in Latin) Aug\u00fasta Em\u00e9rita (see M\u00e9rida, Spain). M\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.As the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for ten months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\n\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Mayan culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Mayan tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Mayan culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Mayan/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  M\u00fakbil pollo (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Mayan tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate.  Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead.  And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (Muk-bil literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a pib, an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.Notable people from the town include Conchi Le\u00f3n, a playwright, actress, director and Yucatecan theater teacher.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Mayan cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\n\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\n\nPoc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork\nSalbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or pur\u00e9ed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.\nQueso Relleno is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce\nPavo en Relleno Negro (also known locally as Chilmole) is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes.\nSopa de Lima is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.\nPapadzules. Egg \"tacos\" bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.\nCochinita pibil is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucat\u00e1n,  that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.\nBul keken (Mayan for \"beans and pork\") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucat\u00e1n towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as frijol con puerco.\nBrazo de reina (Spanish for \"The Queen's Arm\") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.\nTamales colados is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.Achiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called recado rojo. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\n\n\n=== Language and accent ===\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Historic sites ===\n\nAntiguo convento de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Consolaci\u00f3n (Nuns)(1596)\nBarrio y Capilla de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial del antiguo pueblo de Itzimn\u00e1\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Crist\u00f3bal (1796)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de San Sebasti\u00e1n (1706)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Ana (1733)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santa Luc\u00eda (1575)\nBarrio y Templo Parroquial de Santiago (1637)\nCapilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (1706)\nCapilla y parque de San Juan Bautista (1552)\nCasa de Montejo (1549)\nCatedral de San Ildefonso (1598), first in continental Am\u00e9rica.\nIglesia del Jes\u00fas o de la Tercera Orden (Third Order) (1618)\nLas Casas Gemelas aka The Twin Houses (1911)\nMonumento \u00e0 la Patria (1956)\nPalacio de Gobierno (1892)\nTemplo de San Juan de Dios (1562)\n\n\n=== Cultural centers ===\nCentro Cultural Andr\u00e9s Quintana Roo, in Santa Ana, with galleries and artistic events.\nCentro Cultural Olimpo.

Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nSeveral groups and unions offer Taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others.  Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved off along the way or called in by Radio.\nUnlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of Taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber also offers services in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  As of 2006 more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThere is no longer passenger train service to the city. For a century M\u00e9rida was the hub an extensive narrow gauge railway network which was phased out in the late 20th century. The Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche railway network was only connected to the rest of Mexico in 1950. Formerly the \"Meridano\" train ran from Mexico City to M\u00e9rida.  M\u00e9rida's old train station is now a railway museum.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\n\nM\u00e9rida-Progreso (Federal 261), 33 kilometres (21 miles) long with 8 lanes. It joins the city with Yucat\u00e1n's biggest port city, Progreso.\nM\u00e9rida-Um\u00e1n-Campeche (Federal 180), connects with the city of San Francisco de Campeche.\nM\u00e9rida-Kantunil-Canc\u00fan (Federal 180), 4 lane road that becomes a Toll road at kantunil.  It joins M\u00e9rida with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Valladolid and ultimately Canc\u00fan.\nM\u00e9rida-Tizim\u00edn (Federal 176) connects M\u00e9rida with Tizim\u00edn (2nd. largest city in Yucat\u00e1n).\nM\u00e9rida-Teabo-Peto known as Mundo Maya Road Carretera del Mundo Maya, its utilized in both \"convent route\" Ruta de los Conventos, and linking the ancient maya city of Mayap\u00e1n and Chetumal, state capitol of Quintana Roo\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nM\u00e9rida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city and in case of the Regional Hospitals for the whole Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and neighboring states.\nThe city has one of the most prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local Doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making M\u00e9rida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.\nHospitals:\n\nPublic:\nHospital Regional del ISSSTE\nHospital Ignacio Garc\u00eda T\u00e9llez Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nHospital Benito Ju\u00e1rez IMSS\nHospital Agustin O'Hor\u00e1n\nHospital Regional de Alta Especialidad\nPrivate:\nCl\u00ednica de M\u00e9rida\nStar M\u00e9dica\nCentro M\u00e9dico de las Am\u00e9ricas (CMA)\nCentro de Especialidades M\u00e9dicas\nHospital Santelena\nCentro M\u00e9dico Pensiones (CMP)\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2000 the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, \"In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2014guarantee, not just try, not just attempt\u2014 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Mayan children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.\n\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education:\n\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n (UADY)\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Metropolitana (UTM)\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de M\u00e9rida (ITM)\nEscuela Superior de Artes de Yucat\u00e1n (ESAY)\nUniversidad Pedag\u00f3gica Nacional\nEscuela Normal Superior de Yucat\u00e1n (ENSY)\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico Merida satellite campus (UNAM)Among several private institutions:\n\nCentro de Estudios Superiores CTM (CESCTM)\nColegio de Negocios Internacionales (CNI)\nUniversidad An\u00e1huac Mayab\nUniversidad Marista\nCentro de Estudios Universitarios del Mayab (CEUM)\nUniversidad Modelo\nUniversidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID)\nCentro Educativo Latino (CEL)\nUniversidad Interamericana del Norte\nCentro Universitario Interamericano(Inter)\nUniversidad Mesoamericana de San Agustin (UMSA)\nCentro de Estudios de las Am\u00e9ricas, A.C.

        "wiki": "Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archaeological site is located in Tin\u00fam Municipality, Yucat\u00e1n State, Mexico.Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600\u2013900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800\u2013900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900\u20131200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.\nChichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucat\u00e1n.Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.\n\n\n== Name and orthography ==\n\nThe Maya name \"Chichen Itza\" means \"At the mouth of the well of the Itza.\" This derives from chi', meaning \"mouth\" or \"edge,\" and ch\u02bcen or ch\u02bce\u02bcen, meaning \"well.\" Itz\u00e1 is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation for Itza is \"enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,\" from its, \"sorcerer,\" and ha, \"water.\"The name is spelled Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the Maya orthography, Chich\u02bcen Itza\u02bc (pronounced [t\u0283it\u0283\u02bcen its\u00e1\u0294]). This form preserves the phonemic distinction between ch\u02bc and ch, since the base word ch\u02bce\u02bcen (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant. The word \"Itza\u02bc\" has a high tone on the \"a\" followed by a glottal stop (indicated by the apostrophe).Evidence in the Chilam Balam books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the Itza hegemony in northern Yucat\u00e1n. While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest. This earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as Uuc Yabnal (\"Seven Great House\"), Uuc Hab Nal (\"Seven Bushy Places\"), Uucyabnal (\"Seven Great Rulers\") or Uc Abnal (\"Seven Lines of Abnal\"). This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nChichen Itza is located in the eastern portion of Yucat\u00e1n state in Mexico. The northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is karst, and the rivers in the interior all run underground. There are four visible, natural sink holes, called cenotes, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive for settlement. Of these cenotes, the \"Cenote Sagrado\" or Sacred Cenote (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous. In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under Kukulkan, which has never been seen by archaeologists.According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, jade, pottery and incense, as well as human remains. A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice.\n\n\n== Political organization ==\n\nSeveral archaeologists in the late 1980s suggested that unlike previous Maya polities of the Early Classic, Chichen Itza may not have been governed by an individual ruler or a single dynastic lineage. Instead, the city's political organization could have been structured by a \"multepal\" system, which is characterized as rulership through council composed of members of elite ruling lineages.This theory was popular in the 1990s, but in recent years, the research that supported the concept of the \"multepal\" system has been called into question, if not discredited. The current belief trend in Maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period southern lowlands in Mexico.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nChichen Itza was a major economic power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee. Participating in the water-borne circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast, Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as obsidian from central Mexico and gold from southern Central America.\nBetween AD 900 and 1050 Chichen Itza expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and central Yucat\u00e1n. It established Isla Cerritos as a trading port.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe layout of Chichen Itza site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD. Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucat\u00e1n to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula. The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998.\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nThe Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc cenote, with the main architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the basal platform upon which they were built.\n\n\n=== Ascendancy ===\nChichen Itza rose to regional prominence towards the end of the Early Classic period (roughly 600 AD). It was, however, towards the end of the Late Classic and into the early part of the Terminal Classic that the site became a major regional capital, centralizing and dominating political, sociocultural, economic, and ideological life in the northern Maya lowlands. The ascension of Chichen Itza roughly correlates with the decline and fragmentation of the major centers of the southern Maya lowlands.\nAs Chichen Itza rose to prominence, the cities of Yaxuna (to the south) and Coba (to the east) were suffering decline. These two cities had been mutual allies, with Yaxuna dependent upon Coba. At some point in the 10th century Coba lost a significant portion of its territory, isolating Yaxuna, and Chichen Itza may have directly contributed to the collapse of both cities.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nAccording to some colonial Mayan sources (e.g., the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel), Hunac Ceel, ruler of Mayapan, conquered Chichen Itza in the 13th century. Hunac Ceel supposedly prophesied his own rise to power. According to custom at the time, individuals thrown into the Cenote Sagrado were believed to have the power of prophecy if they survived. During one such ceremony, the chronicles state, there were no survivors, so Hunac Ceel leaped into the Cenote Sagrado, and when removed, prophesied his own ascension.\nWhile there is some archaeological evidence that indicates Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 was at one time looted and sacked, there appears to be greater evidence that it could not have been by Mayapan, at least not when Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 was an active urban center. Archaeological data now indicates that Chichen Itza declined as a regional center by 1100, before the rise of Mayapan. Ongoing research at the site of Mayapan may help resolve this chronological conundrum.\nAfter Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 elite activities ceased, the city may not have been abandoned. When the Spanish arrived, they found a thriving local population, although it is not clear from Spanish sources if these Maya were living in Chichen Itza proper, or a nearby settlement. The relatively high population density in the region was a factor in the conquistadors' decision to locate a capital there. According to post-Conquest sources, both Spanish and Maya, the Cenote Sagrado remained a place of pilgrimage.\n\n\n=== Spanish conquest ===\n\nIn 1526 Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Montejo (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cort\u00e9s expeditions) successfully petitioned the King of Spain for a charter to conquer Yucat\u00e1n. His first campaign in 1527, which covered much of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, decimated his forces but ended with the establishment of a small fort at Xaman Ha\u02bc, south of what is today Canc\u00fan. Montejo returned to Yucat\u00e1n in 1531 with reinforcements and established his main base at Campeche on the west coast. He sent his son, Francisco Montejo The Younger, in late 1532 to conquer the interior of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula from the north. The objective from the beginning was to go to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and establish a capital.Montejo the Younger eventually arrived at Chichen Itza, which he renamed Ciudad Real. At first he encountered no resistance, and set about dividing the lands around the city and awarding them to his soldiers. The Maya became more hostile over time, and eventually they laid siege to the Spanish, cutting off their supply line to the coast, and forcing them to barricade themselves among the ruins of the ancient city. Months passed, but no reinforcements arrived. Montejo the Younger attempted an all out assault against the Maya and lost 150 of his remaining troops. He was forced to abandon Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in 1534 under cover of darkness. By 1535, all Spanish had been driven from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.Montejo eventually returned to Yucat\u00e1n and, by recruiting Maya from Campeche and Champoton, built a large Indio-Spanish army and conquered the peninsula. The Spanish crown later issued a land grant that included Chichen Itza and by 1588 it was a working cattle ranch.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nChichen Itza entered the popular imagination in 1843 with the book Incidents of Travel in Yucatan by John Lloyd Stephens (with illustrations by Frederick Catherwood). The book recounted Stephens' visit to Yucat\u00e1n and his tour of Maya cities, including Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. The book prompted other explorations of the city. In 1860, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Charnay surveyed Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and took numerous photographs that he published in Cit\u00e9s et ruines am\u00e9ricaines (1863).\nVisitors to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 during the 1870s and 1880s came with photographic equipment and recorded more accurately the condition of several buildings. In 1875, Augustus Le Plongeon and his wife Alice Dixon Le Plongeon visited Chich\u00e9n, and excavated a statue of a figure on its back, knees drawn up, upper torso raised on its elbows with a plate on its stomach. Augustus Le Plongeon called it \"Chaacmol\" (later renamed \"Chac Mool\", which has been the term to describe all types of this statuary found in Mesoamerica). Teobert Maler and Alfred Maudslay explored Chich\u00e9n in the 1880s and both spent several weeks at the site and took extensive photographs. Maudslay published the first long-form description of Chichen Itza in his book, Biologia Centrali-Americana.\nIn 1894 the United States Consul to Yucat\u00e1n, Edward Herbert Thompson, purchased the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, which included the ruins of Chichen Itza. For 30 years, Thompson explored the ancient city. His discoveries included the earliest dated carving upon a lintel in the Temple of the Initial Series and the excavation of several graves in the Osario (High Priest's Temple). Thompson is most famous for dredging the Cenote Sagrado (Sacred Cenote) from 1904 to 1910, where he recovered artifacts of gold, copper and carved jade, as well as the first-ever examples of what were believed to be pre-Columbian Maya cloth and wooden weapons. Thompson shipped the bulk of the artifacts to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University.\nIn 1913, the Carnegie Institution accepted the proposal of archaeologist Sylvanus G. Morley and committed to conduct long-term archaeological research at Chichen Itza. The Mexican Revolution and the following government instability, as well as World War I, delayed the project by a decade.In 1923, the Mexican government awarded the Carnegie Institution a 10-year permit (later extended another 10 years) to allow U.S. archaeologists to conduct extensive excavation and restoration of Chichen Itza. Carnegie researchers excavated and restored the Temple of Warriors and the Caracol, among other major buildings. At the same time, the Mexican government excavated and restored El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcan) and the Great Ball Court.\n\nIn 1926, the Mexican government charged Edward Thompson with theft, claiming he stole the artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado and smuggled them out of the country. The government seized the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n. Thompson, who was in the United States at the time, never returned to Yucat\u00e1n. He wrote about his research and investigations of the Maya culture in a book People of the Serpent published in 1932. He died in New Jersey in 1935. In 1944 the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Thompson had broken no laws and returned Chichen Itza to his heirs. The Thompsons sold the hacienda to tourism pioneer Fernando Barbachano Peon.There have been two later expeditions to recover artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado, in 1961 and 1967. The first was sponsored by the National Geographic, and the second by private interests. Both projects were supervised by Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). INAH has conducted an ongoing effort to excavate and restore other monuments in the archaeological zone, including the Osario, Akab Dzib, and several buildings in Chich\u00e9n Viejo (Old Chichen).\nIn 2009, to investigate construction that predated El Castillo, Yucatec archaeologists began excavations adjacent to El Castillo under the direction of Rafael (Rach) Cobos.\n\n\n== Site description ==\n\nChichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities, with the relatively densely clustered architecture of the site core covering an area of at least 5 square kilometres (1.9 sq mi). Smaller scale residential architecture extends for an unknown distance beyond this. The city was built upon broken terrain, which was artificially levelled in order to build the major architectural groups, with the greatest effort being expended in the levelling of the areas for the Castillo pyramid, and the Las Monjas, Osario and Main Southwest groups.The site contains many fine stone buildings in various states of preservation, and many have been restored. The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called sacbeob. Archaeologists have identified over 80 sacbeob criss-crossing the site, and extending in all directions from the city. Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple colors. Pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area. The site must be imagined as a colorful one, not like it is today. Just like gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.The architecture encompasses a number of styles, including the Puuc and Chenes styles of the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The buildings of Chichen Itza are grouped in a series of architectonic sets, and each set was at one time separated from the other by a series of low walls. The three best known of these complexes are the Great North Platform, which includes the monuments of El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcan), Temple of Warriors and the Great Ball Court; The Osario Group, which includes the pyramid of the same name as well as the Temple of Xtoloc; and the Central Group, which includes the Caracol, Las Monjas, and Akab Dzib.\nSouth of Las Monjas, in an area known as Chich\u00e9n Viejo (Old Chich\u00e9n) and only open to archaeologists, are several other complexes, such as the Group of the Initial Series, Group of the Lintels, and Group of the Old Castle.\n\n\n=== Architectural styles ===\nThe Puuc-style architecture is concentrated in the Old Chichen area, and also the earlier structures in the Nunnery Group (including the Las Monjas, Annex and La Iglesia buildings); it is also represented in the Akab Dzib structure. The Puuc-style building feature the usual mosaic-decorated upper fa\u00e7ades characteristic of the style but differ from the architecture of the Puuc heartland in their block masonry walls, as opposed to the fine veneers of the Puuc region proper.At least one structure in the Las Monjas Group features an ornate fa\u00e7ade and masked doorway that are typical examples of Chenes-style architecture, a style centred upon a region in the north of Campeche state, lying between the Puuc and R\u00edo Bec regions.Those structures with sculpted hieroglyphic script are concentrated in certain areas of the site, with the most important being the Las Monjas group.\n\n\n=== Architectural groups ===\n\n\n==== Great North Platform ====\n\n\n===== El Castillo (the Temple of Kukulcan) =====\n\nDominating the North Platform of Chichen Itza is the Temple of Kukulkan (a Maya feathered serpent deity similar to the Aztec Quetzalcoatl).  The temple is usually referred to as El Castillo (\"the castle\"), as it was so named by first Spaniards in the area. This step pyramid stands about 30 metres (98 ft) high and consists of a series of nine square terraces, each approximately 2.57 metres (8.4 ft) high, with a 6-metre (20 ft) high temple upon the summit.The sides of the pyramid are approximately 55.3 metres (181 ft) at the base and rise at an angle of 53\u00b0, although that varies slightly for each side. The four faces of the pyramid have protruding stairways that rise at an angle of 45\u00b0. The talud walls of each terrace slant at an angle of between 72\u00b0 and 74\u00b0. At the base of the balustrades of the northeastern staircase are carved heads of a serpent.Mesoamerican cultures periodically superimposed larger structures over older ones, and the Temple of Kukulcan is one such example. In the mid-1930s, the Mexican government sponsored an excavation of the temple. After several false starts, they discovered a staircase under the north side of the pyramid. By digging from the top, they found another temple buried below the current one.Inside the temple chamber was a Chac Mool statue and a throne in the shape of Jaguar, painted red and with spots made of inlaid jade. The Mexican government excavated a tunnel from the base of the north staircase, up the earlier pyramid's stairway to the hidden temple, and opened it to tourists. In 2006, INAH closed the throne room to the public.Around the Spring and Autumn equinoxes, in the late afternoon, the northwest corner of the pyramid casts a series of triangular shadows against the western balustrade on the north side that evokes the appearance of a serpent wriggling down the staircase, which some scholars have suggested is a representation of the feathered-serpent god Kukulcan. It is a widespread belief that this light-and-shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes, but the idea is highly unlikely: it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes, making impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone.\n\n\n===== Great Ball Court =====\n\nArchaeologists have identified thirteen ballcourts for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame in Chichen Itza, but the Great Ball Court about 150 metres (490 ft) to the north-west of the Castillo is by far the most impressive. It is the largest and best preserved ball court in ancient Mesoamerica. It measures 168 by 70 metres (551 by 230 ft).The parallel platforms flanking the main playing area are each 95 metres (312 ft) long. The walls of these platforms stand 8 metres (26 ft) high; set high up in the centre of each of these walls are rings carved with intertwined feathered serpents.At the base of the high interior walls are slanted benches with sculpted panels of teams of ball players. In one panel, one of the players has been decapitated; the wound emits streams of blood in the form of wriggling snakes.At one end of the Great Ball Court is the North Temple, also known as the Temple of the Bearded Man (Templo del Hombre Barbado). This small masonry building has detailed bas relief carving on the inner walls, including a center figure that has carving under his chin that resembles facial hair. At the south end is another, much bigger temple, but in ruins.\nBuilt into the east wall are the Temples of the Jaguar. The Upper Temple of the Jaguar overlooks the ball court and has an entrance guarded by two, large columns carved in the familiar feathered serpent motif. Inside there is a large mural, much destroyed, which depicts a battle scene.\nIn the entrance to the Lower Temple of the Jaguar, which opens behind the ball court, is another Jaguar throne, similar to the one in the inner temple of El Castillo, except that it is well worn and missing paint or other decoration. The outer columns and the walls inside the temple are covered with elaborate bas-relief carvings.\n\n\n===== Additional structures =====\nThe Tzompantli, or Skull Platform (Plataforma de los Cr\u00e1neos), shows the clear cultural influence of the central Mexican Plateau. Unlike the tzompantli of the highlands, however, the skulls were impaled vertically rather than horizontally as at Tenochtitlan.\n\nThe Platform of the Eagles and the Jaguars (Plataforma de \u00c1guilas y Jaguares) is immediately to the east of the Great Ballcourt. It is built in a combination Maya and Toltec styles, with a staircase ascending each of its four sides. The sides are decorated with panels depicting eagles and jaguars consuming human hearts.This Platform of Venus is dedicated to the planet Venus. In its interior archaeologists discovered a collection of large cones carved out of stone, the purpose of which is unknown. This platform is located north of El Castillo, between it and the Cenote Sagrado.The Temple of the Tables is the northernmost of a series of buildings to the east of El Castillo. Its name comes from a series of altars at the top of the structure that are supported by small carved figures of men with upraised arms, called \"atlantes.\"\nThe Steam Bath is a unique building with three parts: a waiting gallery, a water bath, and a steam chamber that operated by means of heated stones.\nSacbe Number One is a causeway that leads to the Cenote Sagrado, is the largest and most elaborate at Chichen Itza. This \"white road\" is 270 metres (890 ft) long with an average width of 9 metres (30 ft). It begins at a low wall a few metres from the Platform of Venus. According to archaeologists there once was an extensive building with columns at the beginning of the road.\n\n\n===== Sacred Cenote =====\n\nThe Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is a limestone plain, with no rivers or streams. The region is pockmarked with natural sinkholes, called cenotes, which expose the water table to the surface. One of the most impressive of these is the Cenote Sagrado, which is 60 metres (200 ft) in diameter and surrounded by sheer cliffs that drop to the water table some 27 metres (89 ft) below.\nThe Cenote Sagrado was a place of pilgrimage for ancient Maya people who, according to ethnohistoric sources, would conduct sacrifices during times of drought. Archaeological investigations support this as thousands of objects have been removed from the bottom of the cenote, including material such as gold, carved jade, copal, pottery, flint, obsidian, shell, wood, rubber, cloth, as well as skeletons of children and men.\n\n\n===== Temple of the Warriors =====\n\nThe Temple of the Warriors complex consists of a large stepped pyramid fronted and flanked by rows of carved columns depicting warriors. This complex is analogous to Temple B at the Toltec capital of Tula, and indicates some form of cultural contact between the two regions. The one at Chichen Itza, however, was constructed on a larger scale. At the top of the stairway on the pyramid's summit (and leading towards the entrance of the pyramid's temple) is a Chac Mool.\nThis temple encases or entombs a former structure called The Temple of the Chac Mool. The archeological expedition and restoration of this building was done by the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1925 to 1928. A key member of this restoration was Earl H. Morris who published the work from this expedition in two volumes entitled Temple of the Warriors.\n\n\n===== Group of a Thousand Columns =====\nAlong the south wall of the Temple of Warriors are a series of what are today exposed columns, although when the city was inhabited these would have supported an extensive roof system. The columns are in three distinct sections: A west group, that extends the lines of the front of the Temple of Warriors. A north group runs along the south wall of the Temple of Warriors and contains pillars with carvings of soldiers in bas-relief;\nA northeast group, which apparently formed a small temple at the southeast corner of the Temple of Warriors, contains a rectangular decorated with carvings of people or gods, as well as animals and serpents. The northeast column temple also covers a small marvel of engineering, a channel that funnels all the rainwater from the complex some 40 metres (130 ft) away to a rejollada, a former cenote.\nTo the south of the Group of a Thousand Columns is a group of three, smaller, interconnected buildings. The Temple of the Carved Columns is a small elegant building that consists of a front gallery with an inner corridor that leads to an altar with a Chac Mool. There are also numerous columns with rich, bas-relief carvings of some 40 personages.\nA section of the upper fa\u00e7ade with a motif of x's and o's is displayed in front of the structure. The Temple of the Small Tables which is an unrestored mound. And the Thompson's Temple (referred to in some sources as Palace of Ahau Balam Kauil ), a small building with two levels that has friezes depicting Jaguars (balam in Maya) as well as glyphs of the Maya god Kahuil.\n\n\n===== El Mercado =====\nThis square structure anchors the southern end of the Temple of Warriors complex. It is so named for the shelf of stone that surrounds a large gallery and patio that early explorers theorized was used to display wares as in a marketplace. Today, archaeologists believe that its purpose was more ceremonial than commercial.\n\n\n==== Osario Group ====\nSouth of the North Group is a smaller platform that has many important structures, several of which appear to be oriented toward the second largest cenote at Chichen Itza, Xtoloc.\n\nThe Osario itself, like El Castillo, is a step-pyramid temple dominating its platform, only on a smaller scale. Like its larger neighbor, it has four sides with staircases on each side. There is a temple on top, but unlike El Castillo, at the center is an opening into the pyramid which leads to a natural cave 12 metres (39 ft) below. Edward H. Thompson excavated this cave in the late 19th century, and because he found several skeletons and artifacts such as jade beads, he named the structure The High Priests' Temple. Archaeologists today believe neither that the structure was a tomb nor that the personages buried in it were priests.\nThe Temple of Xtoloc is a recently restored temple outside the Osario Platform is. It overlooks the other large cenote at Chichen Itza, named after the Maya word for iguana, \"Xtoloc.\" The temple contains a series of pilasters carved with images of people, as well as representations of plants, birds and mythological scenes.\nBetween the Xtoloc temple and the Osario are several aligned structures: The Platform of Venus (which is similar in design to the structure of the same name next to El Castillo), the Platform of the Tombs, and a small, round structure that is unnamed. These three structures were constructed in a row extending from the Osario. Beyond them the Osario platform terminates in a wall, which contains an opening to a sacbe that runs several hundred feet to the Xtoloc temple.\nSouth of the Osario, at the boundary of the platform, there are two small buildings that archaeologists believe were residences for important personages. These have been named as the House of the Metates and the House of the Mestizas.\n\n\n==== Casa Colorada Group ====\nSouth of the Osario Group is another small platform that has several structures that are among the oldest in the Chichen Itza archaeological zone.\nThe Casa Colorada (Spanish for \"Red House\") is one of the best preserved buildings at Chichen Itza. Its Maya name is Chichanchob, which according to INAH may mean \"small holes\". In one chamber there are extensive carved hieroglyphs that mention rulers of Chichen Itza and possibly of the nearby city of Ek Balam, and contain a Maya date inscribed which correlates to 869 AD, one of the oldest such dates found in all of Chichen Itza.\nIn 2009, INAH restored a small ball court that adjoined the back wall of the Casa Colorada.While the Casa Colorada is in a good state of preservation, other buildings in the group, with one exception, are decrepit mounds. One building is half standing, named La Casa del Venado (House of the Deer). This building's name has been long used by the local Maya, and some authors mention that it was named after a deer painting over stucco that doesn't exist anymore.\n\n\n==== Central Group ====\n\nLas Monjas is one of the more notable structures at Chichen Itza. It is a complex of Terminal Classic buildings constructed in the Puuc architectural style. The Spanish named this complex Las Monjas (\"The Nuns\" or \"The Nunnery\") but it was actually a governmental palace. Just to the east is a small temple (known as the La Iglesia, \"The Church\") decorated with elaborate masks.The Las Monjas group is distinguished by its concentration of hieroglyphic texts dating to the Late to Terminal Classic. These texts frequently mention a ruler by the name of K\u02bcak\u02bcupakal.El Caracol (\"The Snail\") is located to the north of Las Monjas. It is a round building on a large square platform. It gets its name from the stone spiral staircase inside. The structure, with its unusual placement on the platform and its round shape (the others are rectangular, in keeping with Maya practice), is theorized to have been a proto-observatory with doors and windows aligned to astronomical events, specifically around the path of Venus as it traverses the heavens.Akab Dzib is located to the east of the Caracol. The name means, in Yucatec Mayan, \"Dark Writing\"; \"dark\" in the sense of \"mysterious\". An earlier name of the building, according to a translation of glyphs in the Casa Colorada, is Wa(k)wak Puh Ak Na, \"the flat house with the excessive number of chambers,\" and it was the home of the administrator of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, kokom Yahawal Cho\u02bc K\u02bcak\u02bc.INAH completed a restoration of the building in 2007. It is relatively short, only 6 metres (20 ft) high, and is 50 metres (160 ft) in length and 15 metres (49 ft) wide. The long, western-facing fa\u00e7ade has seven doorways. The eastern fa\u00e7ade has only four doorways, broken by a large staircase that leads to the roof. This apparently was the front of the structure, and looks out over what is today a steep, dry, cenote.\nThe southern end of the building has one entrance. The door opens into a small chamber and on the opposite wall is another doorway, above which on the lintel are intricately carved glyphs\u2014the \"mysterious\" or \"obscure\" writing that gives the building its name today. Under the lintel in the doorjamb is another carved panel of a seated figure surrounded by more glyphs. Inside one of the chambers, near the ceiling, is a painted hand print.\n\n\n==== Old Chichen ====\n\nOld Chichen (or Chich\u00e9n Viejo in Spanish) is the name given to a group of structures to the south of the central site, where most of the Puuc-style architecture of the city is concentrated. It includes the Initial Series Group, the Phallic Temple, the Platform of the Great Turtle, the Temple of the Owls, and the Temple of the Monkeys.\n\n\n==== Other structures ====\nChichen Itza also has a variety of other structures densely packed in the ceremonial center of about 5 square kilometres (1.9 sq mi) and several outlying subsidiary sites.\n\n\n==== Caves of Balankanche ====\nApproximately 4 km (2.5 mi) south east of the Chichen Itza archaeological zone are a network of sacred caves known as Balankanche (Spanish: Gruta de Balankanche), Balamka\u02bcanche\u02bc in Yucatec Maya). In the caves, a large selection of ancient pottery and idols may be seen still in the positions where they were left in pre-Columbian times.\nThe location of the cave has been well known in modern times. Edward Thompson and Alfred Tozzer visited it in 1905. A.S. Pearse and a team of biologists explored the cave in 1932 and 1936. E. Wyllys Andrews IV also explored the cave in the 1930s. Edwin Shook and R.E. Smith explored the cave on behalf of the Carnegie Institution in 1954, and dug several trenches to recover potsherds and other artifacts. Shook determined that the cave had been inhabited over a long period, at least from the Preclassic to the post-conquest era.On 15 September 1959, Jos\u00e9 Humberto G\u00f3mez, a local guide, discovered a false wall in the cave. Behind it he found an extended network of caves with significant quantities of undisturbed archaeological remains, including pottery and stone-carved censers, stone implements and jewelry. INAH converted the cave into an underground museum, and the objects after being catalogued were returned to their original place so visitors can see them in situ.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nChichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico; in 2017 it was estimated to have received 2.1 million visitors.\n\nTourism has been a factor at Chichen Itza for more than a century. John Lloyd Stephens, who popularized the Maya Yucat\u00e1n in the public's imagination with his book Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, inspired many to make a pilgrimage to Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Even before the book was published, Benjamin Norman and Baron Emanuel von Friedrichsthal traveled to Chichen after meeting Stephens, and both published the results of what they found. Friedrichsthal was the first to photograph Chichen Itza, using the recently invented daguerreotype.After Edward Thompson in 1894 purchased the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, which included Chichen Itza, he received a constant stream of visitors. In 1910 he announced his intention to construct a hotel on his property, but abandoned those plans, probably because of the Mexican Revolution.\nIn the early 1920s, a group of Yucatecans, led by writer/photographer Francisco Gomez Rul, began working toward expanding tourism to Yucat\u00e1n. They urged Governor Felipe Carrillo Puerto to build roads to the more famous monuments, including Chichen Itza. In 1923, Governor Carrillo Puerto officially opened the highway to Chichen Itza. Gomez Rul published one of the first guidebooks to Yucat\u00e1n and the ruins.\nGomez Rul's son-in-law, Fernando Barbachano Peon (a grandnephew of former Yucat\u00e1n Governor Miguel Barbachano), started Yucat\u00e1n's first official tourism business in the early 1920s. He began by meeting passengers who arrived by steamship at Progreso, the port north of M\u00e9rida, and persuading them to spend a week in Yucat\u00e1n, after which they would catch the next steamship to their next destination. In his first year Barbachano Peon reportedly was only able to convince seven passengers to leave the ship and join him on a tour. In the mid-1920s Barbachano Peon persuaded Edward Thompson to sell 5 acres (20,000 m2) next to Chichen for a hotel. In 1930, the Mayaland Hotel opened, just north of the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, which had been taken over by the Carnegie Institution.In 1944, Barbachano Peon purchased all of the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, including Chichen Itza, from the heirs of Edward Thompson. Around that same time the Carnegie Institution completed its work at Chichen Itza and abandoned the Hacienda Chich\u00e9n, which Barbachano turned into another seasonal hotel.\nIn 1972, Mexico enacted the Ley Federal Sobre Monumentos y Zonas Arqueol\u00f3gicas, Art\u00edsticas e Hist\u00f3ricas (Federal Law over Monuments and Archeological, Artistic and Historic Sites) that put all the nation's pre-Columbian monuments, including those at Chichen Itza, under federal ownership. There were now hundreds, if not thousands, of visitors every year to Chichen Itza, and more were expected with the development of the Canc\u00fan resort area to the east.\nIn the 1980s, Chichen Itza began to receive an influx of visitors on the day of the spring equinox. Today several thousand show up to see the light-and-shadow effect on the Temple of Kukulcan in which the feathered serpent god appears to crawl down the side of the pyramid. Tour guides will also demonstrate a unique the acoustical effect at Chichen Itza: a handclap before the in front of the staircase the El Castillo pyramid will produce by an echo that resembles the chirp of a bird, similar to that of the quetzal as investigated by Declercq.Chichen Itza, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the second-most visited of Mexico's archaeological sites. The archaeological site draws many visitors from the popular tourist resort of Canc\u00fan, who make a day trip on tour buses.\nIn 2007, Chichen Itza's El Castillo was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World after a worldwide vote. Despite the fact that the vote was sponsored by a commercial enterprise, and that its methodology was criticized, the vote was embraced by government and tourism officials in Mexico who projected that as a result of the publicity the number of tourists to Chichen would double by 2012. The ensuing publicity re-ignited debate in Mexico over the ownership of the site, which culminated on 29 March 2010 when the state of Yucat\u00e1n purchased the land upon which the most recognized monuments rest from owner Hans Juergen Thies Barbachano.INAH, which manages the site, has closed a number of monuments to public access. While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers.  Climbing access to El Castillo was closed after a San Diego, California, woman fell to her death in 2006.\n\n\n== Photo gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAsteroid 100456 Chichn Itza\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of Mesoamerican pyramids\nMaya-Toltec controversy at Chichen Itza\nTikal\nUxmal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHolmes, William H.

          "This is a site worth seeing. We organized our own tour by renting a car in Merida and visited these ruins (on GPS enter ZA Mayap\u00e1n \u201c Zona Arceologica Mayapan or you will end up in the Pueblo of Mayapan.) I suggest arriving early in the morning as the temperature can heat up",
          "We visited the Mayapan ruins as part of an tour that took us to Mani and a few other places. It\u2019s about a 45-minute trip from Merida to visit this site. The ruins are located a few miles south of the town of Telchaquillo and about 25 miles south of M\u00e9rida or about 60 miles West",

          "This is surely smaller and less spectacular than Tulum or Chichen Itza, but this also costs 45 pesos instead of 500 pesos. Having been to lots of Mayan Ruins in Guatemala was very impressed with how well kept these ruins were and the condition of the complex. Grounds were",

          "This is a fairly compact site with a number of very interesting structures including a long, defensive wall. It is an easy 30-45 min taxi ride from the center of Merida. It is usually not crowded and you are free to roam throughout the site unlike some of the more popular sites.",
          "This was a smaller ruin but still amazing to see. But, because it's smaller, you dont have the crowds that some others mayan ruins do. The signs were informational. The best part was that we were allowed to climb up to the top of the highest \"building\". This was definately",

          "After you have visited the \"biggies\" like Chichen Itza, Tulum, Uxmal,etc. Spend some time visiting the smaller sites. Chances are you will be the only ones there -- we were! It is helpful to have a guide with you to interpret the site, or it just looks like a pile of rocks.",
          "This was our third trip to the Yucatan and we had already visited Uxmal, Chichen Itza, Ek Balam, and Edzna on previous trips, so we decided to visit Mayapan on this trip. Garmin took us down a new highway that made for a very pleasant drive that bypassed the numerous small",
          "We visited Mayapan as a part of a tour with the Santa Barbara cenotes (we payed 800 pesos per person for the tour, but you could probably negotiate a lower price - you can find eager tour operators everywhere in M\u00e9rida). It's not the most impressive ruins, but you get to see",
          "Don't count this one out, it's very interesting and a nice drive from Merida lots to see and only a small entrance fee",
          "cant get enough of this ancient empire. the history and construction will leave you wanting more. If you start in Merida take the RutaPuc or the Convent Tour and stay overnite for a 2-3 day adventure. Wear hats and very good walking shoes...and insect repellent. This IS",

          "Like Uxmal, these Mayan ruins are close to Merida, but not nearly as commercialized or crowded as Chichen Itza, which is a bit farther away. There were only a handful of other people on the grounds when we were there, and the place is beautiful.",
          "We went there when our son and his fiance decided to have a destination wedding in Merida! (Go figure!). We had a great time! The ruins were amazing! Our tour guide was almost as old as the ruins themselves, but he did a fantastic job taking us around the ruins and explaining",
          "Great place to visit , very well maintained , not crowded , which they had some guides or audio guides .",
          "You have to make plans for a visit to here when touring the Yucatan. A quite place off the beaten path. Not allot of tourist. And plenty of photo opportunities to see the natural beauty.",
          "More accessible than chicenitza (I am sure it is misspelled). Ruins are similar and you can climb to the top of the temple- where you can no longer climb at chichenitza. The view is spectacular. It was not overwhelmed with tourists. We traveled as part of a tour excursion and it",
          "This was GREAT! We rode in a air condioned bus with bathroom. The tour guide was AMAZING!!!! He even stopped off at a little place to buy us \u201ccookies\u201d (with his own money), which tasted more like crackers. He was very knowledgeable. They also had a photographer on this",
          "Beautiful and interesting site, built by the ancient mayan culture more than 800 years ago, the archeologist believe this city originaly extended into aproximatly 10 miles, and they have found remains of more than 4000 structures in the city!! , we love to climb up the main",
          "My daughter and I went on a mother/daughter cruise on Carnival to the Yucatan Peninsula and to Cozumel, Mexico. Both locations were very interesting with a lot of rich history. Loved in the dolphins in Cozumel and the history of the Mayan people. Would I do it again, yes!",
          "Went here as part of a bigger cruise excursion. This was my personal favorite part of the excursion. It was very well kept and you actually can climb the steps, for now anyway. Most ruins are visited so often they don't let you climb the \"Pyramid\" steps anymore, but Mayapan",
          "Very interesting and informative. Tours guides were excellent and very well educated on subject matter. Overall the tour is a bit rushed in order to get back to cruise ship. The ruins are amazing and you can climb to the top of the tallest structure. Very historic. The cave dive",
          "This excursion was a family fun trip, however the kids need to be active walkers, and so do the adults. There was a lot of walking, and climbing up stairs if you are short this will be a workout for you. It was nice to visit the ruins but I wish they would have said plenty of",
          "This was a great first stop. We got there around 8:30 a.m., and it was virtually empty. You can climb on everything, which is fun. There are a lot of ruins in a small amount of space - easy to see in an hour and a half. The ruins are interesting and impressive, but not huge. (So",
          "These are some of my favorite ruins to visit because not many people are present, you can climb onto the structures and experience the incredible views, and all of the structures are in one small area, making it easy to get around and visit every structure quickly and on foot.",
          "Mayapan was the last great Maya city florishing in the postclassic period. It's an excellent site. We arrived shortly after the open and had it to ourselves almost to the end of our visit. Terrific, although faded frescoes, masks and bas-reliefs. The circular temple can be",
          "The ruins have been repaired so people are allowed to climb on them. It\u2019s better to go before 12pm I went at 2pm and climbed that bad boy Mayapan. It was hot out there. Wouldn\u2019t recommend it after 12pm.",
          "We got a taxi here from Merida it was 300 pesos return and 35 pesos to enter.We had such a amazing time climbing to the top of the structures and just sitting taking it all in.We spent a good few hours there, it was just so beautiful and peaceful we only saw one other family",
          "This place is a hidden gem. However, you do need to have pre-existing knowledge of Mayan history. It was nice that people were able to walk to the top of the temple. There was also an area where you could see some original painting. There has not been that much research done",
          "Not only did you get to see the ruins but you could climb up to the top of one! Simply amazing! Kumin and Jasemine were our tour guides and they had a lot of knowledge on the ruins and were very helpful. There was always medical staff on standby and plenty of water when needed!",
          "Just off the highway, easy to get to, but still felt undiscovered, as just few tourists were there at midday, all the better, as the place is amazing, so well preserved and maintened, on a par with Uxmal, but scaled down, modestly priced and yes, you can climb a pyramid, just",
          "The Mayapan Ruins were well worth the visit, we had the site entirely to ourselves, except for the birds of which there are many. Its a very pleasant compact site, like a mini version of Chichen itza just without the crowds or the numerous stalls selling tat to tourists. We",
          "This site is amazing. no one there, its like going back in time with yourself or a significant other and you have all the time in the world to enjoy it",
          "An inportant Mayan settelement back in the pre hispanic area. Its worth tre trip to this amazing site and dont forget to visit the cenote in the nearby town on the other side of the highway. Mayapan was the political and cultural capital of the Maya in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula",
          "Mayapan is one of my favorite small ruins in Yucatan. It is my standard trip when taking guests to a ruin that is not too far outside of Merida. Very well kept and not many other tourists on weekdays. Highly recommended if you are visiting Merida.",
          "My brother and I visited the Mayapan Mayan Ruins before visiting any of the other historical sites, and we were very impressed with them. Even having visited all the other well known sites such as Chichen Itza and Uxmal, though impressive, we particularly enjoyed Mayapan the",
          "These Mayan ruins are south of Merida and not near anything else. You turn onto a dirt road from the main road. We were unsure sure we had arrived until you see a few cars parked to your left and a small cement building in which you pay your entrance fee and find separate men's",
          "Most of the Mayan sites restrict access to the buildings but not this one. No vendors to distract and parking is at the gate. As an archaeologist I recommend a visit.",
          "Mayapan is less well known than the Chichen Itza ruins but they are beautiful Mayan ruins from around 800 - 900 AD. We visited these ruins as part of a tour with Juan from Yucatan Cenote and we enjoyed them greatly. A good tour guide can make a huge difference as they can",
          "It is small, tidy, easy access for people who may not be able to walk as far as one needs to at some other ruins. Some super interesting stucco decorations still n existence, and one can climb all the pyramids. One tip: bring your own water!",
          "One of the few Mayan ruins that has not become a circus. Tour at your own pace, enjoy the peaceful countryside. Signs explaining what you are seeing.",
          "Not as impressive as Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 but with its own attractions like the walkable Caracol, a Castillo you're allowed to climb and a unique floor painting.",
          "Went to Mayapan on Friday afternoon and stayed for 2 hours. We saw exactly 5 other visitors. We were able to climb through many of the buildings. Spectacular view of the site from the top of The Temple of Kukulcan. Mayapan is not as big or well signed as Chichen Itza or Uxmal",
          "On a previous visit to Merida, we took tours to Chichen Itza, Uxmal, Kabah and Celestun. This time we wanted to branch out and visit some of the lesser known sites. So we booked the Mayaland tour to Mayapan and the Caves of Loltun. All our previous tours had been great, but",
          "Mayapan is a small site, but nevertheless with some impressive structures. It\u2019s not far off the beaten path between Chichen Itza and Merida, so it\u2019s worth the stop. Unlike Chichen Itza there was almost no one there, so we had the place almost all to ourselves.",
          "Mayalan was recommended by a local as the best smaller site with very few visitors, hence quiet. We visited the afternoon after the morning in Uxmal. While Mayapan id not to be compared to Uxmal, it wins in that there are so few visitors( NO visitor centre at all),and all the",
          "This place is a mast do, if you want to escape the tourist crowds. It was 40c entry fee on arrival and you are free to roam around. The signage is in English and Spanish. Please note*** I went here by myself for the morning. I thought the easiest option for myself was to get",
          "Mayapan is well worth the forty minute trip outside Merida. There are unique carvings and masks. Give yourself a couple of hours to tour the site.",
          "Thought I never get here, too remote .... Not so too remote from Merida though... Our group of 8 and 5 other people were the only ones there ... Very well preserved",
          "Mayapan Ruins are the one best ruins of Yucatan state. I prefer them because are very close to each other and they look so conserved . you can enjoy of these place in a calm and relaxed way.",
          "This was my first time ever visiting pyramids. It was not on my radar until the owner of our bed and breakfast in Merida suggested it before we did the visit to Uxmal. That was the best decision ever. You can actually climb the largest pyramid here and the energy and magic",
          "This was our 5th visit to a Mayan archeological site and was by far the most interesting, second only to Uxmal. Many many structures to look at and climb and photograph. Great relief to not have touristy things like gift stores and tour guides soliciting your business. A large",
          "The Mayapan ruins are right up there with Uxmal in being a great site to visit. The ruins are not as grand and awe inspiring as Uxmal but they are very accessible, non commercial, and interesting. It is a site with extensive ruins that are open to climbing and viewing. A",
          "We visited here and Chichen Itza the previous day and it was like night and day. The site is not difficult to get to by public transport and it was quiet without being deserted, we could climb the pyramids and get the views over the site which we worth having. I admit, not the",
          "I went with my Friends to visit this place and it\u00b4s really beautiful, the voew at the top of the piramid is amazing, I recomend this place if you come to visit Yucatan",
          "Far less crowded that Chichen Itza and wonderful details in the ruins. Convenient to Merida and surrounds.Available for climbing.",
          "We arrived just as the site opened and, for the most part, had the place to ourselves. You really have the sense of what this place must have been as a busy city. At the base of the large pyramid, they have preserved some of the original carvings. The view from the top really",
          "Few tourists make it to Mayapan so it is a hidden gem! There are actually more buildings here than we expected, including one quite steep, tall pyramid type structure. Climbing is still allowed on all the ruins but some are very steep and can be treadherous. A lovely, quiet",
          "Mayapan is a magical place, is the city where the Mayans rehearsed the buildings they will later make bigger in Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Very close to Merida, if you can visit in the equinox it will be a wonderful experience",
          "We were on a private tour and chose Mayapan ruins over other options because it is less visited and not crowded with tourists. As I reviewed each option this site is not much different. The main difference was the type of stone used in construction and it is unique because it",
          "This place is breathtaking. The amount of skill and belief that went into building these is unreal. We had the privilege of climbing the tallest pyramid. SO cool. Coming down was a little scary, but only for those of us who are scared of heights!",
          "This archeological site has very few visitors but it is worth seeing. There are several pyramids and buildings to see, with a main pyramid having a good view, but with an unusually steep climb.",
          "I was the only tourist here on my birthday at 4pm. I was standing on the top of the pyramid and felt like someone standing on the top of the world. My favourite place in Mexico. Loved it.",
          "Great, quiet area, not as visited as most, but certainely worth the trip... Ruins are fantastic, can climb on most ot them.",
          "Great hands on exploration of an ancient Mayan ruin. Angel our tour guide from Lawsons was knowledgeable. We explored the site at our own pace and stayed as long as we wished.",
          "We had this place all to ourselves. I kept wondering why no one else was around, felt it was too good to be true. We spent about 2 hours walking around. This was also my second attempt to climb a pyramid and I finally did it! My advice for novice climbers - don't look up or",
          "Great ruins you can get to by car from Merida. There were literally three other cars the whole time we were there. We had a guide that helped us figure out what was what and we enjoyed climbing to the top.",
          "Small park. No one was in area while we were there. Interesting buildings. We were able to climb all structures.",
          "It is less than one hour from Merida, it is easy to get there, not expensive, less crowded than other archeological sites and very nice. I would strongly recommend you to visit Mayapan if you like Mayan ruins and are visiting yucatan peninsula. you will find several buildings",
          "Smaller site, can easily be walked through and plenty of shade available. Beautiful ruins that are mostly intact and you can climb them if you feel the need. Informative plaques at almost every structure help grasp what this site once looked like. Best of all, you will probably",
          "We visited this site with Yucatan cenotes on a personal tour for our anniversary. It was wonderful. You can walk or climb at your own pace. Its a beautiful old ruins and quite a climb to top of biggest pyramid. Entry fee is about 20 peso a piece. So much history can be seen",
          "Mayapan is an excellent site to visit. Not crowded and where some actual color of the original structures can be seen where the sun has not bleached it away. Worth the trip out of Merida.",
          "Mayapan is close to Merida and nicely restored. It was the last capital of the Maya and has a well-documented history. The cool thing is that if you go during the week, you will probably have it to yourself. Read up on it before you go. Easiest to rent a car, but you can also",
          "We initially thought about taking a bus to get to the Mayapan ruins from Merida when planning our vacation. However, once we arrived and befriended a taxi driver in the previous days, we decided to go by taxi. It was less expensive than what a tour would have cost us and we",
          "This small but intact site was one of our favorites. It's not highly publicized so it was pretty calm and quiet and enjoyable.",
          "Incluso August 24th, 2016 I got married by a mayan wedding and he Made our Photos there! A beautiful late classic mayan site. You should go and visit it. My husband and I are Federal licensed tourist guides and we love the cultur and our country. Welcome!",
          "We were the only 2 tourists that day. Beautiful temple complex. Still able to walk between the old stone buildings & even climb to the top where the most spectacular views over flat Yukatan awaits. Well worth the 40 pesos! 30mins to 1hr sufficient for the visit.",
          "We took the Merida bus tour for 25.00. Very glad we went. Lots of history. You can walk right up to and take good pics. Our tour guide gave the best information.",
          "I went here on a tour from Merida after hearing it was a mini-Chichen itza. This place to me was on par or even better than Chichen itza. The ruins were awesome and we pretty much go to explore the ruins by ourselves. You actually get to climb the pyramids and once you get to",
          "Just happened to go to this historical site from a sign on the road. Great hidden treasure with self guiding information. Easily found.",
          "We did Chichen Itza, Uxmal, the Ruta Puuc and Mayapan. All are worth seeing. Mayapan is quite incredibly restored and amazing that one can climb up to the pyramid. Some of the other reviews and information we got said that it is a place that likely one would be in solitude and",
          "Mayapan is less developed than Chichen Itza, but it has several reconstructed buildings, and they are all climbable! It's on the Convent Route and easily reached from Merida, but few people go there. You will have no problem taking photos without another tourist walking in",
          "The really good point is the lack of tourists. You can still clamber up the main pyramid for a view of the ruins and the surrounding forest. There are a few paintings to track down that are faded and fragmented. I've seen the other set piece UNESCO sites in the Yucatan a number",
          "Not crowded at all, but we ventured out to go to a series of cenotes. They were outstanding! Just follow the signs and be prepared to stay a few hours. We got finished with all three at dusk, which made driving back to Merida a little nerve racking.",
          "There are many Mayan ruins in the Yucat\u00e1n but these are very user friendly and not overflowing with tourists like Chichen Itza. Also, you can still climb the pyramid. Aguide is useful but not essential unless you want in depth history and greater details than the average guide",
          "Astonishing ruins. But Murals are too damaged. I loved the visit and learned a lot from the mayan. Then visited cenotes nearby it was pretty cool.",
          "We stopped on our journey to several cenotes in the area, just because we had time. So glad we did! There were 7 of us and just a handful of others. We sauntered about and climbed all the climable spots for a wonderfully relaxing hour and some. Views were fabulous. We were",
          "Mayan (Banner of the Maya) was one of the last major capital, and was densely populated walled city. It existed after Chichen Itza - and the central area resembles Chichen Itza with a round structure (like the observatory) and a 'Castillo' with 4 staircases. The central core of",
          "So nice. There are so many little buildings. A great place to explore if you're done climbing really high pyramids and your knees hurt. There's a lot to see, but it's all close in. There isn't anything that stands out as awesome. But there's so few people at any given time",
          "Fascinating place, our guide was very informative and took time to answer all questions, It's an all day trip as there is so much to see.its in the jungle region and gets really hot & humid, drink a lot of water if you can. They have a restaurant on site also changing rooms if",
          "It was quiet and extensive: good stop when going on Ruta Puuc (a little off RP). We were glad we made the side trip.",
          "We have lived in this region for years but never went to Mayapan, it's amazing. There are so few tourists that go here that's it's still lovely, no vendors in sight and clean!!! I hate to see it get congested but I will say, go if you get a chance.",
          "Mayapan is an excellent example of Mayan Ruins. It is a quick bus ride to visit Mayapan or you can rent a car to visit several ruins on Ruta Puuc.",
          "Another well preserved archeological site, though not as large or impressive as Uxmal. Perhaps because it is smaller, it wasn't nearly as crowded as Uxmal either. If you are into ruins and in Merida, it's worth seeing.",
          "Mayapan is the unadulterated view of later Mayan culture. It is not as grande as some of the more commercialized sites like Uxmal or Chichen Itza, but it gives you a better idea of how the Mayans (ultimately unsuccessfully) tried to adapt to their failing environment caused by",
          "Although not the largest of the sites and not nearly as well known as Chichen Itza, Uxmal, or Pelanque, it is little gem. Peaceful, serene, and easily negotiated in one morning. Simply beautiful. Not to miss.",
          "we visited Mayapan without high expectations but must say that it very much worth it visiting this mayan site. It is quite small but in a very good shape. you can still climb all the piramides and you have a wonderful view from the highest temple. It looks a bit like Chichen",
          "This site is small but a real gem. Very few visitors were there when we visited and it felt like we had the place to ourselves. The historic site is well preserved and you can climb on the big pyramid. We also loved the observatory, and some of the detail work has been",
          "Excellant example of the Mayan Life. Well kept, English/Spanish guides that are very knowledgeable. Wear comfortable clothes and sneakers.",
          "Mayapan is very easy to reach from Highway 184 (you exit the highway, and the entrance is right there, fee was 40 pesos). We went there with a 2-year-old on Dec 26, and managed to tour the place within 1.5 hours (9:45-11:15am). There were no vendors on site so bring your water.",
          "Mayapan (meaning Mayan flag) was the center of power in the Yucatan after the decline of Chichen Itza. It is considered to be post-classic without as much detail as you'll find at the classic sites of Chichen Itza and Uxmal. We drove from Merida and got there early. We were",
          "I will echo any reviews I read before visiting the Maypan Ruins. When we arrived we basically had the place to ourselves. I would imagine that eventually these ruins will become more popularly discovered and may be busier in the future. I would take advantage of it as soon as",
          "Mayapan has been settled from ca. 1050 until 1400. In the beginning of the 13th century Mayapan defeated Chitchen Itza. Since the late post classics they built up the former existing place to the biggest city at this time on Yucatan. Over 4 square kilometers there were living in",
          "Mayapan is a smaller set of ruins than Uxmal and consequently less travelled! That means it costs less and has less jockeying for position- but is still amazing to see and experience. You can climb each of the temples and catch the view- which is amazing. Definitely worth the",
          "My 2nd visit to Mayapan, you can catch a bus from the 2nd class terminal on 50x67 it's about an hour.Entrance fee low compared with many other sites and the best part is that you will almost have the site to yourself, or only share with 6 people. Mayapan was once as important as",
          "Two of the things that make Mayapan relaxing are that visitors are not overwhelmed by on-site vendors selling all kinds of Mexican handicrafts or souvenirs, and that there are no tour guides available, so your visit can be as relaxed as you like. The drawback to the",
          "Mayapan is small but very well restored. A small version of Chechen Itza. About an hour or so drive from Merida. Not many visitors - a plus. Note: except for clean bathrooms, there's very little around. Take water and snacks. Worth the visit! Recommend!!!",
          "Very well preserved and still in the process of being restored today. Impressive structures and decorations on the buildings. Amazing size in the jungle areas of Mexico.",
          "I highly recomend this ,great for family water is beautiful,you can climb the ruins which is a great experience.",
          "Great site to visit if you're looking to avoid crowds! Makes for a very quiet and relaxing experience. Also, a great place for photos, as there won't be as many people around.",
          "The star attraction of Mayapan is the towering Temple of Kukulcan, a terraced pyramid similar to the one found at Chichen Itza, around which are dozens of temples, altars, shrines and residences, many adorned with colorful murals and well-preserved stuccos! We absolutely loved",
          "So after reading a few reviews I was desperate to go to these ruins but thought it might be difficult using public buses etc. In actual fact it was so easy. Buses leave from the Noreste Bus Station (otherwise known as the 2nd class terminal) on the corner of 50th and 67th. They",
          "Mayapan ruins were from the last period of the Mayan Kingdom. They are basically a smaller version of Chichen-Itza. We have been to Chichen-Itza and Uxmal in the past and climbed both great pyramids (Kukulcan and Magician's) which you can no longer climb at present but even",
          "This was such an amazing adventure..No crowd, so private...Many stuructures to investagate, also a gorgeous place for pictures..A shower came when were there and the stones were beautiful when they got wet...Went in the Observatory till it passed.. What a wonderful day...!!!!!!!",
          "We were staying in Merida with our two daughters. It was a 45 minute morning drive out to the ruins. We basically had the ruins to ourselves. The kids were able to climb and explore to their heart's content. We avoided the crowds at chichen itza and had a great morning.",
          "Since we didn't want to deal with the crowds or vendors, we decided to visit Mayapan. It was a 40 minute drive from Merida. We were the only one there at first. The kids loved climbing the structures. We found relieve from the heat under an avocado tree growing out of a cenote.",
          "Great site, few people as it is off the beaten track and you have to get there by car, can be reached by bus but more difficultly. This site has a pyramid you can still climb, a replica of the one in Chichen itza (which you cannot climb.) Very interesting site with lots of",
          "This is our first time in town and first time seeing the ruins. The place is beautiful and well kept. We went In the middle of the week and they were cutting the grass. A must see",
          "The place has mayan ruins which locals claim to say they were built by the same people who built Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, in fact there are similar buildings like for example the observatory.",
          "I loved the fact they let you go all the way to the top of the ruins. The view is great and perfect to capture great shots. Very nice and clean place.",
          "These ruins are smaller than the more touristy ones but still impressive and extensive. The great things is that there were relatively few visitors when we visited and no restrictions, so the grandchildren (aged 7 and 9) could climb on everything, keeping their interest keen.",
          "Mayapan is one of my favorite Maya ruins to visit. No tourist buses, no hoards of people, no litter or people selling stuff...many times it has just been friends and me and you can sit and listen to the birds sing while you imagine it back in the day!",
          "Elements of Mayapan are very reminiscent of Chichen Itza, but on a smaller scale and more crudely built. You have a good chance of being the only ones there, if you discount the fat iguanas that inhabit the site. The temples can all be climbed. There are figures in stucco",
          "Just the very center of the site core has been consolidated for tourists, but it's a great experience. It's a cool site and you can climb on everything. I definitely recommend reading the Wikipedia page before going, because the signage is lousy and there's a good chance the",
          "This place is very cool! It isn't roped off like Chichen Itza and you can climb the pyramids. We spent about an hour and saw maybe six other people. The pictures are fantastic!",
          "We were the only visitors there. Magical site where you might be alone as you climb to the top of the pyramids.",
          "The Mayapan ruins are not well known, we happened to hear it about it one evening while reading a book on the Maya, and so the next day we got in car and drove there. What a gem! It was late afternoon when we arrived and there were hardly any visitors, which was fabulous! We",
          "Definitely smaller than other sites, but in great condition and you can walk wherever you like. And you may be the only one there . . .",
          "My wife and I visited mayapan a couple of days after visiting Uxmal. Although the site is much smaller, and less grand (in scale) than uxmal, it is no less fantastic. In fact, we both preferred Mayapan. First, traveling from Merida, pay very close attention to the road signs,",
          "Went on a private tour with Dan Griffin of Ko'ox tours (Mayako-ox.com) and had a fantastic time. I've been to many Mayan sites and Mayapan is unique in the way so many structures are wedged into a small place. Practically empty when we went which is a shame since there is so",
          "It does not have the scale or details as other sites, however this site has several things going for it. Firstly, there's hardly anyone there so you can really enjoy it in peace. Secondly, the entrance cost next to nothing (20mxp?). Lastly, they've managed to find and save",
          "Despite the noise of highway road work going on right in front we really enjoyed these ruins. Went in late afternoon and were the only ones there. Not that far out of Merida on a new 4 lane highway. Only had a temporary sign out front which we almost missed so watch out for",
          "A worthwhile stop and as other visitors have mentioned it is nice to see the ruins without crowds of people. With a good guide it can be rewarding to wander and learn about an ancient civilisation. Weather can be hot and humid, don't forget hat and water.",
          "Very few people are visiting Mayapan, so you have the feeling of beeing back in Maya times without crowd. I personally like this site and the buildings, very relaxing visit.",
          "Our guide took us to this ruin for three reasons. It is much more accessible to Merida along a good road. It is just as significant as some of the more well known ruins, but a small fraction of the cost (43 pesos). We had it all to ourselves. I loved the grassy area leading to",
          "Our guide David Bacab took us to Mayapan, after stopping at the plaza del mercado so my husband could see the local produce. Apart from a school group we (husband, adult daughters, and me) we were the only ones in the site. Though not as impressive or in the same magnitude as",
          "A small Mayan ruin village,but very interesting and we were allowed to walk the temples.The advantage of visiting Mayapan is it is not crowded,time to explore and enjoy the history of another Mayan village",
          "My iPhone accesses Apple Maps through TripAdvisor. If you follow the map directions you WILL NOT end up at the ruins. The TripAdvisor address says the site is south of Merida and that much is correct. It is south of the village of Telchaquillo. There is also a village of",
          "Wonderful place !!! Beautiful ruins where you can climb on. And almost nobody there !!! It was really nice and relaxing visiting this site.",
          "I visited 9 different Mayan Ruin sites on my recent trip to Merida, and Mayapan was one of my favorites. When I first got to the site I was the only person there. That probably had something to do with the problem of finding the place. There was construction occurring on the",
          "These ruins are a hidden gem. Lesser visited than other sites in the area but equally impressive. One of my favourites in the Yucatan.",
          "Like all other reviews, this is a peaceful oasis. Although Chitchen Itza has the name, it also has crowds. Uxmal and Mayapan rate as the best in the area. Stroll through, climb up, take pictures, observe many iguanas. Clean washrooms, pack a snack or plan a stop in Hacienda Teya",
          "We made our own way here on a local Collectivo from the bus station downtown, not the big Ado one but the local bus station behind the Mackay. We went to the village of Telchaquillo and then walked down a road under construction, crossed the highway and entered the site. We",
          "Mayapan is easy to get to from Merida and easy to tour. No big crowds of tourists to obstruct your photos, and only 40 pesos ($2.50) entrance fee. My favorite is the round structure that reminds me of a birthday cake! I have been to this ruin several times, and never get tired",
          "Fascinating site with some similarities to Chichen Itza only smaller. It's an hour and twenty minute drive from M\u00e9rida and it is an easy park, 40 peso entry fee, walk through the gate and you're there. You can climb the large pyramid and survey the whole site and see for miles",
          "How far back in time must one travel to be transported to a place that time has almost forgotten...we have experienced time travel... Walking in the shadows of greatness and wonder...cultural cities from long ago ...remnants from people we will never know ...skills in stone to",
          "This is one of the hidden treasures. There were barely 5 other people when I was at this site. Beautiful place if you want to photograph ruins without people in it. It is definitely worth driving the extra distance. You can climb the pyramid and the views from top are gorgeous.",
          "We traveled to Mayapan with Lawson's Yucatan excursions. We had the entire place to ourselves and our guide was so knowledgeable and told us bunches, while also letting us explore ourselves. We climbed to the very top, which was grueling, but worth it. My man got down on one",
          "This site isn't close by any other ruins, but it is definitely worth going out of your way for. There are several buildings in the complex, all very close together in a compact site. You can see A LOT in a short amount of time, without a lot of walking. The pyramid is a",
          "One of my favorite ruins of all time! Very cool, with few visitors as compared to other sites. If you enjoy ruins, this is one you should not miss. Very easy to get to using a car or you can go on a tour on a fancy bus, if that's what you prefer. There are some tourist buses",
          "Mayapan/Mani Tour Grayline with Augusto was wonderful. Mayapan every bit as good as Chichen Itza but only 2 other tourists there when I went. A Mayan ceremony on a platfrorm, fantastic ruins . No commercialism selling items, no place to buy drink so come prepared with water,",
          "We weren't expecting it to be that impressive after visiting Uxmal a few hours before. But we loved it! We were the only ones there (afternoon). It was possible to climb the pyramids and the view from the top was fantastic. To me, it was better than Labna, although Labna was",
          "I visited the Mayapan Ruins during the morning of November 25th as a solo female traveler. I took a second class bus (Lineas Unidas del Sur bus line) from the Noreste Terminal in Merida (Calle 67 between Calles 50 and 52). When I was researching my travels, I remembered",
          "Chichen Itza is way too crowded. Uxmal is breat taking, but you can't climb the pyramids anymore. Mayapan is relaxed, laid back and gives you a hands on experience. No ved Ndors, buses full of tourists just a wide open beautiful example of Mayan architecture and design. One of",
          "The guide very good and explained a great architecture and people lifeatyle. He spoke Myan and told us that this isnthw common language in homes as much spanish is in mexican homes. This is a need to visit site if you are in the area. I highly recommend this for families and",
          "Breath taking. We visited this while on a cruise and with our Yucatan cenote tour guide. Very well preserved and not over crowded. Make sure you go all the way to the top and get the best views. Lots to see and full of history.",
          "Mayapan was a bit of a drive from where we were staying but it was well worth it. It's about 50 minutes from Merida off a two lane highway. They are expanding it to a 4 way highway which is currently being constructed. The speed is reduced to 30-40 km for a stretch, which was",
          "This was a real surprise! It's a seldom visited site, but excellent and impressive. Be aware that there are no conveniences there, no gift shop, no snack bar, cold drinks etc, so bring your own. We went early in the morning, and arrived at a grass parking area, not van sure if",
          "We visited this site from Merida and it would be easy in a car. We went on the bus from the 2nd class bus station. The bus journey was interesting in itself - with lots of locals going to and (poor Spanish) and note the time you pass the bus in the opposite direction. The site",
          "I would recommend these ruins as it is an enjoyable but not overwhelming trip.An excellent day trip from Merida.. We have visited 4 times but enjoy every visit more than the previous one.",
          "After researching different ruins as an excursion from Progreso, this one seemed to be close to the top of the list, without being crowded. We wanted to see a Mayan ruin site, and still be able to see something else on our cruise stop (a cenote). Chichen Itza is always what",
          "We went to this ruin site because it was part of our excursion with Yucatan-Cenote EcoAdventures (wonderful company). This site was quite large with many buildings excavated. There was a lot to see including a climb to the top of the pyramid which had an absolutely breathtaking",
          "We loved this site, it was a short easy commute from Merida by collectivo to telchaquillo (26 pesos). From there it's a 15 min walk or 10 peso per person tricemotor ride to the site, you can ask trice driver to wait if you don't want to walk back to town. There is a nice little",
          "These ruins are really cool. It's a bit of a trek to get a bus out there - try to avoid getting the Oriente bus that stops at every town along the way! It would be great to visit with a car though. We were almost the only people here - apart from a Mexican family having a picnic",
          "The amazing William Lawson tours took us to this gem. This ruin site is fantastic. If you love history and hate crowds, this is the place for you! Only one other couple was there during our visit. The local guide was great, and so are the frescos. The grounds are",
          "Mayapan is a very interesting place with few visits and very quiet. Bring water as it is very hot and very few shades.",
          "Mayapan was cool because there was no one there. It's like a mini Chichen-Itza without the traffic. The ruins are older and less restored than the bigger sites, but you can explore more, and for better or for worse you can climb up the pyramids.",
          "We have been to many of the archaeological sites in the state of Yucatan and we have returned to this one several times. It is not a very popular site and, hence, there is a good chance that you may have it all to yourself. You are free to explore this site and climb the",
          "We came here by public bus from Merida (from terminal Norestre). The site is amazing!!! And yes, it's a mini-Chichen Itza with nobody around you: no crazy vendors, no annoying guides, no food and no people. Just you and the ruins. There was just us and another couple of lovely",
          "Often skipped, this was actually the seat of power for the entire Mayan state. It is a little taste of every style of Mayan architecture all at one location. The pyramid can be climbed, and there is an observatory like Chichen Itza. Highly recommend this one!",
          "We always bring our foreign groups and friends to this wonderful ancient site. The grounds are beautifully kept, and most of the time we have the place to ourselves as not very many tourists come here. There are no distracting vendors. You can still climb the pyramids and",
          "This is a wonderful, quiet site to explore ruins without crowds and guides. You can climb a pyramid!",
          "Love this place! It's on the smaller side but is one of the best preserved and most researched of all the ancient sites in the area so the structures have substance. Very walkable with a lot to see on the site. However it's quite hot (hotter than Merida) and there isn't much",
          "Firstly getting there, we caught the local bus from Merida for 23pesos, from the Noreste bus terminal, they only run every hour. Trip takes about 1.5 hrs & wanders around the towns picking up the locals. Tell the driver you want to go to ruinas .de Mayapan. He will drop you at",
          "They are awesome and you are able to climbe them to the top. We took dune buggies there threw the salt fields. There are also building remains around to. If you have not see ruins before go see these.",
          "I loved the bus ride to get to Mayapan- stopping at lots of little villages along the way. And the site itself was lovely: small, picturesque and interesting. Climbing the structures is still allowed, which is a huge plus for me. I love getting up high and seeing the views that",
          "this city is magnified by its buildings, is a post-Uxmal Mayan city and chichen itza, I boomed after the fall of chichen and visit this city made me go back to the Mayan era where even the cornfields and deer were harvested rolled down the forest, this city has much to offer if",
          "This site is beautifully preserved. It is not crowded. Not too big. All temple can be climbed. It is definitely worth the trip. There are reliefs, paintings and incredible stone carvings.",
          "A must if you are in the Merida area. The circular ruin was amazing, and we had the entire place to ourselves. You can still climb the tallest ruin.",
          "We have visited many of the major Mayan sites and yes - they are spectacular in many ways....but they are often overrun with tourists (like myself..) and vendors. In fact, Chichen Itza is starting to look more like a flea market than a Mayan ruin (but I digress). Mayapan is a",
          "We chose to visit these ruins because they are off the beaten path. We saw one tour bus in the parking lot - a group of Japanese tourists who left shortly after we arrived. Otherwise, we saw less than a dozen other visitors. The exhibits have plaques in Mayan, Spanish, and",
          "We have seen almost all the archeological ruins in the area. We have been here for nine years as long time visitors. I must say that the ruins at Mayapan rival if not surpass Chichen Itza. The ruins have been restored so beautifully. There is a lovely entrance with washroom",
          "Although not the major attraction that is Chitzen-Itza, we enjoyed a quiet morning here, guided by an ex-pat. We had the place almost to ourselves, so there was no rush, and the admittance fee is not high. We climbed the highest pyramid enjoying the cool breeze at the top and",
          "We have now been to Mayapan 4 times and each time we are as enthralled as the first time. Go early in the morning and you might be the only one there. This is not as developed as some others such as Izamal, etc, but the pyramid is great and the site is very photogenic. One",
          "I had put off a trip here for the longest time, but glad I finally went. Although not as impressive as other sites, this site, the last Maya capital is almost a mini version of Chichen Itza. You can climb the ruins and the grounds are well-kept. It is very convenient from Merida",
          "It is incredible get get so few visitors at this fabulous archeological site. It is large and interesting. They even have an original painting and some remaining paint from others. Our wonderful guide explained things to us about Chichen Itza that we did not learn from our",
          "The day we visited, we were all alone. It is still being uncovered, but it known that was once one of the largest and most important Myan sites--larger that the much frequented Chen Itza. The temples and other partially restored ruins are quite amazing.",
          "This was very interesting but especially because we were on a tour with Catherwood Travel and thus had an expert archaeologist explaining the various sites, including Mayapan.",

          "We went to Mayapan in January and as others have noted, the ruins don't receive as many visitors as other Yucatan sites, such as Chichen Itza. The highway is quite close, so you will hear some noise from it but at least there are no bus-loads of tourists! You can climb almost",
          "I'm glad we came here after visiting Chichen Itza; otherwise, Chichen Itza would have been just a big disappointment. This place is like a more condense version of Chichen Itza, but it has some better aspects. 1) We spent about 2 hours here, and were the only ones there the",
          "I can't recommend visiting Mayapan highly enough! We went to Chichen Itza and Tulum on the same holiday, and although they were both beautiful and impressive, what we liked about Mayapan was the tranquility. We were 2 of about 5 visitors to the site, and after a half an hour",
          "My family and I stopped by Mayap\u00e1n on our way from Canc\u00fan to M\u00e9rida and I'm glad we did. It is smaller compared to some other ruins but it was cheap ($36 pesos per person) and absolutely no crowds. There were honestly maybe 5 other people there besides my family. Also, visitors",
          "A smaller version of Chichen Itza with no crowds, vendors, no restaurant or shops. Just the archaeological site which is really wonderful. Without all the crowds you can actually enjoy the site, climb the pyramids and walk around without being pestered to buy stuff. Take your",
          "Mayapan is absolutely beautiful. It looks just like Chitchen Itza, but you will have the entire site to yourself. There were only two other visitors while we were there. You can climb every structure at Mayapan as opposed to Chitchen Itza where you can't climb or touch or even",
          "In any other country this would be a must see. In Mexico it is second tier but dramatic. Like other lesser sites it is quiet and hence more romantic. More for the general architectural layout than the small number of detailed carvings (thought these are also unusual).",
          "We hit 6 ruins in 3 days. Mayapan was breathtaking. Beautiful ruins and grounds. Plus we were the only ones there. The stucco is amazing and the iguanas are huge.",
          "We visited both the Uxmal ruins and Mayapan ruins on two different days. Uxmal was incredible, massive, fascinating and has developed services for tourists such as a cafe, gift shop, etc. The Mayapan ruins were also awe-inspiring, varied, had evidence of much more still to be",
          "Easy to find; well kept; you can climb on most of them. Still unvovering more ruins. Incredible view and number. Much larger than expected.",
          "Beautiful Ruins , no one there but us!!! Excellent, quiet and very enjoyable! We were allowed to climb the pyramids and there are many artifacts with original paint and such. Excellent day!",
          "Then I suggest Mayapan. I went with my boyfriend who had already seen Chichen Itza and wanted to go again but after I checked out the reviews online with all the complaints of the crowds and vendors, we asked our tour guide Angel with William Larson for his suggestion. He took",
          "This is a little Chichen Itza, the guide told us, this is the latest Mayan city habited before Mayans desapair...",
          "What I know of Mayapan Ruins - not much, I have to confess, is that it is the most importante site of the postclasic Mayan period. The powerful Itzaes were defeated there. If you like archaeoligcal sites this is a must visit.",
          "Wonderful ruins quite close to Merida. Easy to walk around as the part that is open to the public is just the city centre and very compact. Price for entry was 36 pesos which is very reasonable and you can climb on the ruins. Bathrooms here have just been replaced and are new",
          "There are two sets of Mayan ruins, this lovely looking one and a tired little site consisting of two minor structures, one significantly degraded, in the middle of a rather seedy looking neighborhood in the modern city of Mayan itself. Be sure you go to the right one!",
          "Free exploration of a once great mayan city- no people - no restrictions. Whereas other Mayan sites are roped off and feel like a museum filled with tourists, at Mayapan you can climb the pyramids and imagine the city freely",
          "This was a walled Mayan ruin. It is modeled after the Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza. If you have visited Chichen Itza you will recognize the copies of El Caracol and El Castillo. It will probably take you about 45 minutes to drive there from Merida.",
          "the new cathedral was built on top of the old mayan ruins. if you drive around you can see the tall walls that are still standing as a witness of history",
          "A Full day of Travel and Sightseeing, be prepared to leave your Hotel Early and expect a full day on your feet and travel,with your only rest time, LUNCH",
          "We absolutely enjoyed this site. Relatively compact, it is really easy to imagine the place as a functioning town centre. The variety and quality of ruins are top-notch. We arrived early and the place was completely tranquil and bereft of crowds. No man-made pathways and hardly",
          "We were looking for an interesting trip to take on our stop in Progresso from the Carnival Cruise- we're so glad we talked to William Lawson's tour company and booked a driver to take us to Mayapan and the Cenote. Our tour guide Angel was FANTASTIC- his knowledge and love of",
          "I really like Mayapan ruins they are so peaceful and have some great things to see. There are actual mayan paintings here as well as pyramids to climb. A must see really.",
          "The monumental center that is open for tourism occupies about 1/50th of the walled, urban city. Under all of those trees one sees from the top of the Temple of Kukulcan are the remains of houses, streets, workshops, stores, neighborhoods, markets, and other public squares, home",
          "This ruin is a little off the beaten path, hence fewer visitors and no vendors, bonus! We hired a cab from Merida which was very reasonable, cheaper than taking a tour. Visitors are able to climb on, around and in the buildings. Some restoration is in evidence, we found a mural",
          "The Mayapan Ruins were a nice surprise after visiting Chichen Itza days prior. We only ran across three other families and best of all no vendors. Woooo Hooo!!! We especially liked that we could hike to the top of the ruins. Unfortunately, much of this site has not been",
          "Not too far from Merida, we drove out there right after breakfast and were the only people there for our entire visit. Very reminiscent of Chichen Itza, but you can climb on the ruins and really get a good look around. Mayapan was the largest settlement in that area at one",
          "Wonderful ruins. Very peaceful and best of all we had them nearly all to ourselves. Definitely worth the trip",
          "Very compact archeological site with nice piramids and even two nice sculpted chaac faces (mascaron) puuc style. No juego de pelota. Very quiet site. Easy to reach by public transport (from Noroeste) say Mayapan Zona arch. not to be confused with Mayapan village. Bus stops right",
          "Great site free from crowds of uninterested visitors and flocks of vendors. The site is defined well with explanations in Spanish and English. Some stucco and paintings survive but like many Maya ruins there has been some looting.",
          "Just an awesome site. Huge and only 5% uncovered. There was only one other couple there when we visited so you'll have the whole place to yourself. Bring a guidebook,water and 36 pesos PP. This place should be on everyone's list along with Chit.,Ex Balam and Uxmal. Check out the",
          "What a surprise to see such a nice sport with a 100% full conservation ! Looks like the past has been polished and starts to re-live again ! Being there is to feel to be part of the History !",
          "We've visited a number of sites in the Yucatan over the years, but really liked this one. There were only 2 other people there and no vendors, so you felt much more involved. The site is compact, easy to walk, and all structures have signs to describe them. We thought the",
          "Mayapan Ruins is one of the largest Maya Sites, the size of Chichen Itza and surrounded by many cenotes. It's not busy and you can climb the pyramid. Bring your water. $36 pesos per person",
          "There were only 6 other people there and so you pretty much have the place to yourself. You can still climb the piramids",
          "Great, but we went after Chichen Itza, and compare to, it was so small. Worth to go definetley, but if you have to pick, go to Chichen Itza",
          "Loved this place! A small version of Chichen Itza without the crowds and just 30 minutes away from Merida. At one time, one of the most important Mayan cities. Highly recommended for a day trip from Merida.",
          "Feeling lucky to have visited such an unspoiled historical area. No lines of vendors here. However, the site is expanding its restroom facilities soon, so that could mean tour buses... We arrived near the end of the day, when there were almost no other visitors. A great place",
          "Beautiful compact site of Mayan ruins. Like a little city within a city block or two. Beautiful ruins in better shape than most. Our 10-year old loved running around and exploring and climbing the ruins. Not very many people visiting at all. Highly recommended.",
          "Mayapan is a pleasant compact little sight. It was basically the capital of the maya between 1224-1444. what is left of the site is compact, it takes only an hour or two to see. Having seen a lot of mayan ruins on this trip (chichen itza, uxmal, ek balam, tulum, oxkintok, coba,",
          "Allegedly a small Chichen Itza this is a delightful small ruin -- large enough to have all the main components of a Yucatan ruin (ball court, observatory, temples, original paintings, etc.) but small enough to enjoy without being overwhelmed by hoards of other tourists.",
          "I hired a car to take us to Mayapan as I found no tours going there. It was perhaps an hour and 15 min. drive. We arrived early from Merida and had the site all to ourselves for about 40 minutes. We did not hire a guide, just took our time reading the markers and enjoying the",
          "It covered the archeology and climate as well as history and culture. There was something interesting for everyone. I loved learning how they made their textiles, whereas my son was interested in the Mayan languages.",
          "Mayapan is the opposite of Chichen Itza in many ways. When my family went to the site we were basically alone--although we ran into a Merida-based comedian which was interesting. Getting there is fun too.",
          "The ruins at Mayapan are awesome, close and accessible. They are not over run, and the sites are well marked and explained in English and Spanish. The site is surrounded by lush vegetation. It's other worldly, a place you can take your time at as you stroll and look at your",
          "We visited Mayapan as part of a 9-day tour of visiting 11 archaeological sites that started in Cancun and ended in Villahermosa. We spent the night in Merida and had an early start so that we arrived just as the site opened. We had the whole place to ourselves to enjoy with our",
          "Although far less known than Chichenitza or Uxmal on the Yucatan peninsula, my wife and I very much enjoyed our recent visit of this very significant Mayan site, located some 40 miles (1 1/2 hour drive) southwest of Merida in the direction of Ticul. Since the ruins are far away",
          "We were driving through villages / towns around Termozon Sur and stopped by the Mayapan ruins early afternoon during the week. Entrance fee about $35 pesos per person. Quite atmospheric particularly from the top of the pyramid (a bit tricky to climb to the top but don't look",
          "We visited these ruins while on a day trip woth William Lawsons (highly recommend) and the owner recommended Mayapan because it's not as busy as Chichen Itza and you can climb the pyramid (you can't do that at Chichen Itza). We were not disappointed. We were the only people",
          "I like the charming of this place, small, informal and green... I don't like the unconcience of people who leave its coke can anywhere...",
          "Close to Merida, and certainly worth the drive. We had the whole place to ourselves. The fact that a person can climb up the pyramids, as well as the other structures was great. We liked this site the best of all we visited.",
          "Mayapan is indeed a lesser-known site but it has its history. If you speak Spanish, look for Eric at the entrance and he will explain things for you. He is very passionate about the place and knows quite a bit. His fee is usually around $200 pesos and your biggest problem will",
          "Ok, the fresco of the fisherman (uncovered only in 2002) is interesting, but you can see a replica - and see it much better, since the original is framed in and inaccessible to the point of annoyance - at the Gran Museu de Mundo Maya in Merida. The other frescoes are nothing to",
          "I did enjoy the friendly people, the warm weather that Merida has in January, February, and March. I really would not recommend going in the summer, unless you like extremely hot days.",
          "Great site. Quite compact but with all the essential elements and no tourists. Just you, some lizards and some beautiful mot-mots. A much better experience than over-crowded Chitchin-Itza.",
          "Just 1 1/2 hour drive from Telchac, these ruins are well worth the trip. When we visited we were the only people there. The ruins are well preserved and unique. There is a round tower as well as a large pyramid of the same type as at Chichen Itza. You can see painted frescos in",
          "I wouldn't go out of the way to check it out but we were on another tour anyways. Not much to see and no crowds and you can climb to the top of the pyramid. Then you can see just how flat the Yucatan is",
          "This Mayan site is the best I have been to for families with small children. The site is impressive but easy to see and to walk to all the buildings. It is not normally overcrowded and climbing on he buildings is permitted. I did not see a single harassing vendor anywhere. A",
          "We visited Mayapan on our own by taxi from Merida \u2013 I think it cost 600MXN for the two of us return, including up to two hours waiting time. It was one of our favourite Mayan sites, not because it\u2019s the best \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most recent, by which time the Mayans had apparently",
          "Important Toltec/Maya site in postclassic period. Some painted murals still visible. Can climb many structure to obtain better views of the city. As with most Yucatan sites, the guided comments on ground tablets need reworking.",
          "30-meter pyramid you can climb - No crowd, in fact, no one else. A great site and a great half-day trip from Merida.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting Mayapan because it has everything I look for when visiting ruins: it has the Castillo de Kukulc\u00e1n (pyramid structure which you can climb), a cenote (but you can't go in), the round temple and amazing paintings. I highly recommend visiting this",
          "We were heading to Merida and the sun was strong and the temperature was hot. Our Mexican trip always revolves around 3 or 4 major ruins but after a day or two of climbing and walking, we always seem to be \"ruined\" out faster than expected. Mayapan was a nice way to finish our",
          "Mayapan, Mayan ruins in Merida Yucatan, is an attraction that demonstrates the ingenuity of the early Mayan culture and the strength of the human spirit. It is also one of the few remaining attractions where you can experience the entire feeling of the past by being able to",

          "Mayapan is the last Mayan city in the Yucatan and has a fascinating history. Read up online before visiting as there aren't any guidebooks or maps at the site. There's a wealth of buildings to explore and as it's much smaller than Uxmal or Chichen Itza it's easier to move",
          "It is a smaller site but which holds a structure similar to that of Chichen Itza, a rival city, it is an important part of the history of the Yucatan",
          "We were on a cruise ship that stopped in Progreso and didn't want to do any of the \"herd mentality\" ship tours so we hired a taxi to drive us to Mayapan. It was well worth the time and money!! The place was practically deserted, and beautiful! It was awesome to climb around",
          "After 14 years living in M\u00e9rida I finally got to Mayapan with my family and we were very pleased that we made the 45 minute journey out of the city. The route there is pretty direct and is generally well signed. Traffic was fairly light. We spent about 90 minutes at the site",
          "So close, if your in Merida, check it out, we spent a few hours on our way to other sites. The ruins are worth running around on before you get too hot and need to jump in the cenote. Bring your bathing suit, it's great, the most open we have seen, like a big pool.",
          "We were the only visitors to this extensive site at first and even when a few others showed up, the site was large enough to swallow them up so that we still felt we almost had it to ourselves. Iguana population entertaining and varied. An amazing place.",
          "These ruins are absolutely amazing! Don't miss them for anything. They are build in Chichen Itza style, but guess what - there's no one there. You can climb all the structures and there's a bonus: very well preserved Maya paintings in color. It's such a spiritual place. To get",
          "Mayapan is just off the road south of Merida. This is a large site, but the main buildings are in a compact sunny, grassy area. Included are a large pyramid with 60 steps you can climb for great views of the entire site, a few smaller pyramids, several structures with rows of",
          "When we were there around noon we were literally the only guests. The site is not that big but well worth a visit if you are passing by. There is no shop or toilet in the vicinity so bring water.",
          "Thought we had been there and done that, but took friends for their first visit and were even more impressed the second time. Check out all of the 'hidden' finds under the palapa roofs! Exceptionally well maintained with signs in Spanish, Maya and English. Entry fee at this time",
          "Beautiful place with restoration in progress. There are several large structures intact. Recommend you review the layout on the internet. One of the few places where you can still climb to the top of the main pyramid. 35 peso entry fee and very few people take the time to",
          "We got there about 3:30 on a Wednesday. There were no other tourists to compete with at that time. It is bigger than Chicen Itza and as not commercialized. It closes at 5:00. This was well worth the time. Take the time to do some history search before you go.",
          "Mayapan is good and interesting, but it needs more explaination of the site. And it defo needs a small tienda (shop)",
          "The ruins are wonderful. My tip is to go as soon at the park opens. No one is there, you will have the site to yourself. Towards noon and thereafter it becomes quite crowded.",
          "We did not plan to visit Mayapan but just stopped when we drove by ... And stayed for almost two hours! The site is really a lot bigger than we tought and we were more or less the only tourists there. Mayapan is really worth a visit if you have time.",
          "By all standards a missing spot to the major archaeological sites in the Yucatan peninsula. This was my FIRST stop in a 2 week visit to Yucatan, I knew it was close by to Merida so made it my first priority. You pretty much have the place to yourself as it's not well known, but",
          "The ruins are very interesting, although it would have been nice to see more placards explaining the area, or to have received a brochure. We did bring our guidebook.",

          "Mayapan flourished 1250-1450 as the successor to Chichen Itza. If you see it after CI, you will appreciate the parallels: Castillo, Caracol, cenote, but all thrown up in a hurry and on a smaller scale.",
          "Not to be missed!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband and I were the ONLY people there. I can't quite describe the feeling I had but the only way to describe it was that I NEVER felt alone. The feeling of the past was almost beautifully haunting. Wherever we wandered at the site we were",

          "There are many Mayan Cities but if you go to Chichen Itza Uxmal and Mayapan you can say you visit the most important Mayan Cities in Yucatan, look under all the huts and you will find the real tresures like frescos, recent excavations and many more",

        "wiki": "M\u00e9rida, officially known as Santiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida, is the capital of the municipality of Libertador and the state of M\u00e9rida, and is one of the main cities of the Venezuelan Andes. It was founded in 1558 by Captain Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez, forming part of Nueva Granada, but later became part of the Captaincy General of Venezuela and played an active role in the War of Independence.\nThe capital city's population is 204,879 inhabitants, and the metropolitan area, that includes the municipality of Libertador, reaches 345,489 people (Census 2001). The city accounts for 28% of the total population of M\u00e9rida State, which has more than 750,000 inhabitants (Census 2001). It is home to the University of Los Andes and the Archdiocese of M\u00e9rida. It also has the highest and longest cable car in the world. It is the largest student and tourist center of western Venezuela. The mass transit system (Troleb\u00fas M\u00e9rida) is available as a means of tourist transport.\nThis city sits on a plateau nestled in the valley of the Chama River, which runs from end to end. The town of M\u00e9rida is located at an altitude of 1,600 metres (5,200 feet). As background on the horizon rises the country's highest summit: the Pico Bol\u00edvar with an altitude of 4,981 metres (16,342 feet).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nM\u00e9rida was founded by Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez on October 9, 1558 in one of the Pamplonian mining expeditions he led. The first settlement of M\u00e9rida was not the current one but 30 kilometres (19 miles) to the south, in Xam\u00fa, where today stands Lagunillas. Nevertheless, in November 1559, Juan de Maldonado moved the settlement to nearby El Punto (presently the Zumba area), because of constant confrontations with the native neighbours.Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez's foundation had not been authorized by the New Granadian Authorities, so in 1560 they sent Juan de Maldonado to arrest Juan Rodr\u00edguez and regularize the new city. On June 24 Maldonado moved M\u00e9rida to its present location on the plateau and rechristened it as Santiago de los Caballeros. The city then came to be governed by the corregimiento of Tunja until 1607, when it became itself a corregimiento of the Audiencia of Santa Fe.In 1622, M\u00e9rida became the capital of the Governorate of M\u00e9rida, whose chief official established his residence there. The city and territory were part of New Granada until 1777, when it was integrated into the Captaincy of Venezuela.\nThe city was elevated to the status of an episcopal see in 1785. This led to the creation of a seminary, which in 1811 became the University of the Andes.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe city was named after the founder Juan Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez, who called so in honor of his hometown of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain.\nHowever, Juan de Maldonado renamed it as San Juan de las Nieves. In 1559 the name changed again, opting this time for Santiago de los Caballeros. Gradually, it was adopting the name of Santiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida, combining the variants that had been appointed to the city until then.\nThe word M\u00e9rida comes from the Latin \"em\u00e9rita\", from Emeritus, one who has merit, which also references to veteran Roman soldiers who were discharged from the army after completion of their mandatory service commitment. Another feature common to both the Spanish and the Venezuelan M\u00e9ridas is that in both cities, there is a tributary of the main river with the name Albarregas.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n \n\nThe city is located in the center of the Venezuelan Andes, in a wide plain in the valley of the Chama River, between the Sierra Nevada de M\u00e9rida to the southeast and the Sierra La Culata to the northwest. The old quarter of the city is on the alluvial plain known as Tatuy.\nM\u00e9rida has four principal rivers and some smaller seasonal streams in the less urbanized parts of the city, these last ones have a significant water flow only in times of heavy precipitation. The most important river is the Chama, followed by the Albarregas, which cross the plain and divide it into two parts: the Banda Occidental (west bank) and the Banda Oriental (east bank). These two rivers run from one end of the city to the other. The other two principal rivers are the Mucuj\u00fan and the Milla, which flow into the Chama and Albarregas. In the lower part of the city is found the La Rosa lake, one of some 200 lakes in M\u00e9rida State.\nIn the center of the city the terrain, located on a plain, is almost flat. Nonetheless, there is an average incline of 3 to 7 degrees, which causes a difference in altitude between the high and low parts of the city of more than 400 m (1,300 ft), the average being 1,630 m (5,350 ft) above sea level at the Plaza Bol\u00edvar. However, the areas surrounding the city are rough and uneven, situated in the valleys formed by the Chama and Albarregas rivers and the Sierra Nevada and Sierra de La Culata ranges.\nThe valley in which the city is located was formed approximately 40 to 60 million years ago with the creation of the Venezuelan Andes and its continuous erosion by the area's water systems. Its soils consist of alluvial sediment and clay. Below the city runs the major tectonic fault in the western part of the country, the Bocon\u00f3 fault, which forms part of the South American Plate.\nThe vegetation in the interior of the city consists of medium to tall trees, and ferns (Pteridophyte), located mainly near the basin of the Albarregas river. On the outskirts of M\u00e9rida, one finds non-urbanized areas, where sub-mountainous and seasonal jungle vegetation predominates. On the other hand, vast coniferous forests extend toward the south, where they were planted some years ago. Toward the north and east, one finds cloud forests.\nSignificant among the local fauna are important populations of certain small and medium-sized birds such as hummingbirds and parrots (Psittacidae), spread particularly to the south of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nM\u00e9rida lies between a tropical monsoon climate (Am), bordering on a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cwb), with cooler temperatures than other cities in Venezuela, with dry winters.  Though the emission greenhouse gases has caused a rise in temperatures, this has been less, in relative terms, than in other important cities in Venezuela, with readings that vary between 19 \u00b0C and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), with an overall average of 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F). Precipitation is heavy during the rainy season, from April to November, though the city does receive more sunshine than most cities in the Colombian Andes, since the valley is too narrow for fog to accumulate.\nVenezuela is situated in an inter-tropical zone, so that there is very little temperature variance over the course of a year. The same is true in M\u00e9rida\u2014the temperatures recorded in August are normally comparable to those measured under comparable conditions in broad daylight in January.\nOn the other hand, given M\u00e9rida's location in the interior of the country, far from the maritime coasts and the influence of the ocean, and its high altitude, the temperature variance over the course of a day is relatively high. Between day and night a difference of more than 10 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F) can be observed; this difference sometimes reaches more than 20 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F). The maximums are reached during the day, and are usually around 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), but on rare occasions exceed 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). The lower limit of daytime temperatures tends to be around 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Government ==\nM\u00e9rida is the seat of the state and municipal governments, and is also home to the Governor and the Mayor's offices, the state legislature, and the regional offices of the judicial and electoral branches. Important representatives and governors are also taken to this city to meet at an annual voting session. Moreover, 13 of the 15 prefectures of the Libertador Municipality are located within the city.\nNowadays, politics have an important role among the general population, although to a lesser extent than in the larger urban centers, and the most important government positions, including Mayor and Governor, are held by members of the official party, the Fifth Republic Movement.  Because of the great concentration of students, and the importance of the Universidad de Los Andes in local development, the positions of University Director and President of the Student Body of the University of The Andes are also of great importance within the local political scene; the first of these offices is currently filled by an opposition party member. Due to the recent suspension of the elections for President of the University Student Body, the city has seen an intense wave of protests that have left more than a dozen wounded.\nIn the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum, the city of M\u00e9rida voted against the overall trend, as at least 60% of voters opposed the continuation of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's mandate. By contrast, the majority of the rest of the population of the state of M\u00e9rida voted in favor of Ch\u00e1vez.\n\n\n=== City planning ===\n\nBecause of its location on a plateau, in a small valley, covering an area of some 10 to 15 km (6 to 9 mi) in length and between 1 and 3 km (2 mi) wide, the city now lacks additional space for urban development. Though its polygonal area covers some 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi), the city occupies a little over 25 square kilometres (10 sq mi), and the rest consists of less developed zones or areas of uneven terrain, such as mountains or hillsides.\nFor this reason, the city layout is unorganized, oriented only by the traffic axes constructed in decades past. The layout of the city center or \"Old Quarter\" is in the Spanish Colonial style, consisting of eight major avenues running east\u2013west and forty streets running north\u2013south, creating blocks of 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330 feet) per side.\nHistorically, M\u00e9rida has been characterized by less pronounced differences between socio-economic classes and for its high quality of life.  Recent years, however, owing to the economic situation confronting the country, have seen a significant increase in slums in the hills and outskirts of the city.\nThe southeastern part of the city, historically the headquarters of the large Haciendas that produced sugar cane, has for several decades undergone major urban development, consisting principally of single-family dwellings, and has grown almost to the point of joining with the city of Ejido, a bedroom community. Ejido currently extends to within less than 2 km (1 mi) of the border of M\u00e9rida, and the two cities are linked by a large avenue that goes from the neighborhoods of downtown M\u00e9rida to the outskirts of Ejido. At this point, it turns into a highway, running to the city of El Vig\u00eda, thereby uniting M\u00e9rida's metropolitan area.\nDespite the limited space available for development, M\u00e9rida has the largest proportion of green areas per capita in Venezuela, thanks to its many squares and public parks, the one surrounding the river Albarregas being particularly noteworthy. The School of Architecture of the University of the Andes puts into practice diverse proposals for creating areas protected from urban development, thereby reducing the impact of population growth on the environment.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nThere were only two neighborhoods in the city at the beginning of the 20th century. One of them was Casco Central (central quarter), located in the east bank of the plateau; which in turn was divided in various zones, identified according to the name of the local square within. The other neighborhood of the city was by the other side of the Albarregas river, in the west bank. It was known as La Otra Banda (\"the other bank\"). However, as a result of the Oil Boom, immigration and various other reasons, new neighborhoods appeared as years went by. The first to emerge were those near downtown. Then, due to the lack of real estate and in the search of quieter areas, neighborhoods were created far, at the time, from the city center. Some of these old spurs have now become part of the city. The following are the main neighborhoods of the city.\n\nBelensate\nPredominantly a higher-class neighborhood, it contains the largest and most luxurious houses in the city.\nCasco Central\nIt comprises the historic city center. It is the main commercial, cultural, and urban area, containing most  museums, libraries, churches, and retail shopping stores in M\u00e9rida.\nChama\nIt is a residential area for the middle class located in the vicinity of the Chama river. It is the lowest-altitude neighborhood in the city, situated about 200 metres (660 feet) lower than downtown. It will be connected to Casco Central via an aerial cableway planned as part of the M\u00e9rida trolleybus project.\nHumboldt\nIt is a populated neighborhood to the southwest of the city, with increasing commercial development in recent years.\nLa Hechicera\nLocated at the northern end of the city, it contains the scientific and engineering buildings of the ULA, as well as the zoo and the botanical garden.\nLa Parroquia\nThis is the current name of the village formerly known as La Punta. It shares similarities with the Casco Central, with residential and commercial zones intermingled. It contains the second Bol\u00edvar Square in the city, as well as large public high schools and sporting facilities, such as the Metropolitan Stadium and the sport complex Cinco \u00c1guilas Blancas.\nLa Pedregosa\nIt is a long neighborhood located in the valley of La Pedregosa creek. It is mainly a residential zone. Although connected to the city, it is far enough from it that its development has increased in the last decades due to the availability of suitable real estate.\nLos Curos\nThis is a popular neighborhood, almost exclusively residential, though it houses one of the few industrial zones in the city.\nPie del Llano\nSituated in the middle of the city, it surrounds the airport and local branches of a number of government offices, as well as the city Mayor's office. It is a commercial and residential neighborhood with plenty of public parks.\nAvenida 16/Campo de Oro/Santa Juana\nIt is a middle-class neighborhood located in the geographical center of the city. It borders the Tatuy mesa, which houses a number of car dealers and auto shops and, above all, the largest hospital of the city, the IHULA (Instituto Aut\u00f3nomo Hospital Universitario de los Andes)Finally, the municipality is divided (for political purposes) into parishes; thirteen of the municipality's fifteen parishes are within the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nDespite being one of the largest cities in the Venezuelan Andes, M\u00e9rida has traditionally been less populated in comparison to other more rapidly growing cities in the country. At the beginning of the 19th century, the city only had about 5,000 inhabitants. The demographic growth saw no major changes until the last three decades of the 20th century, when the population tripled, from 74,000 (according to the 1971 census) to the current estimate of 214,000. The increase in number of inhabitants was mainly due to a recent exodus of farmers moving to the urban centers, a phenomenon seen all over the country. Moreover, the prestige of the University of the Andes transformed M\u00e9rida in one of the leading educational centers nationwide. As a result, the city houses an important student population from all over the country.\nAccording to the last census, performed in 2001, M\u00e9rida's population was of 204,879 inhabitants. This value does not include the population omitted by the survey, which was estimated to be about 6% nationwide. However, M\u00e9rida's metropolitan (greater) area, which includes the neighboring cities of Tabay and Ejido, houses over 300,000 inhabitants.\nIn 2006, assuming the usual natural level of growth in the area (between 2.1% and 3% annually), the population reached 230,000 inhabitants, while the metropolitan area would have reached 350,000, thanks to the high growth rate in the city of Ejido, which is one of the largest of the Andes area.\nOther estimates indicate that the actual population of the city has now reached about 250,000 inhabitants and that the metropolitan area has 350,000 inhabitants.\nThe population of M\u00e9rida is relatively homogeneous. There is, however, a large community of foreigners, resulting from the inter- and intra-continental migratory patterns of past eras. Among these there are significant groups of Italians, Portuguese, and Colombians. According to the 1990 census, a little over 4% of the population\u2013some 7,406 inhabitants\u2013is of foreign origin.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city enjoys the highest quality of life in Venezuela. In the year 2000, thirty-six health centers were located in the metropolitan area of M\u00e9rida, as follows: one type I hospital, one type III hospital, and one type IV hospital, in the city proper, plus 15 urban clinics, four of type III and 11 of type I. The area also has 18 rural clinics, 13 of type II and 5 of type I.\nAs in other respects, the Universidad de Los Andes and its buildings are closely tied to the city; the health care infrastructure consists largely of medical centers belonging to the former, in addition to private health centers. Notable among the public hospitals that offer free services is the Instituto Aut\u00f3nomo Hospital Universitario de Los Andes (IHULA), the largest in the region, as well as two smaller hospitals and a chapter of the Venezuelan Red Cross. The larger private hospitals (commonly referred to as \"clinics\") are the Clinical Hospital of M\u00e9rida, the Clinical Center, the M\u00e9rida Clinic, and the Albarregas Clinic. There are also another dozen smaller clinics.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city of M\u00e9rida has one of the lowest poverty indexes in Venezuela. According to the 2001 census, 18.09% of the population lives in poverty; this figure is beaten only by San Crist\u00f3bal (17.05%) and the municipalities of Chacao (8.69%), Baruta (11.22%) and San Antonio de Los Altos (6.13%) in the state of Miranda.The city's economy has been evolving and transforming since the beginning of the 20th century. Traditionally, agriculture formed the most significant part of economic activity in M\u00e9rida, which was the distribution center for agricultural goods in the state. Furthermore, large sugar cane haciendas were located nearby; their income led to the construction of a central sugar refinery in which all of M\u00e9rida's sugar cane was processed. This refinery was eventually abandoned and has now been converted into a museum. With the construction of M\u00e9rida Cable Car, the trans-Andes highway, and the city's airport, the city's economy evolved, with the tertiary services sector\u2014especially tourism\u2014displacing the primary agricultural sector.\nTourism, dubbed the \"green industry\", is the principal source of income in the city, and one of the most flourishing industries. Touristic activity benefits from the potential offered by the Andes mountains surrounding the city, and from the city's own parks, museums, and plazas, among other features. In addition, in recent years, owing to the creation of the only free cultural, scientific, and technological zone in the country, the city has begun to develop in the field of technology, thanks also to the support of the university in this matter.\nThe city of M\u00e9rida now stands out at the national level for its low cost of living and its high (relative to cost of living) per capita income of $4,381, ninth among Venezuelan cities. The service sector contributes a large percentage of the state's income. In M\u00e9rida 82,537 people are economically active, of whom 6.67% are unemployed.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nDuring the colonial era and long after independence, the city was isolated from other parts of the country because of the lack of transportation routes to the outside world. Midway through the 19th century, the first highway was built, linking the city with the rest of the country, thereby facilitating access and vehicular traffic. After this point other routes were planned, but lack of maintenance and the nature of the terrain have caused significant interruptions in land traffic between M\u00e9rida and the rest of the country.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nThe city had one national airport, Alberto Carnevalli Airport, which is embedded in the center of the city, and once offered connections to the principal cities of the western Venezuela, such as Maracaibo and Caracas. Furthermore, this airport was one of the most active in the country, with more than 20 daily flights to and from Caracas alone. The airport was closed down however in 2009 due to the many accidents that occurred because of its difficult position within the Andes. As of 2015, Avior Airlines offers flights to Caracas. Other nearby airports, such as Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonso International Airport in El Vig\u00eda, now serve M\u00e9rida.\nThe airport was built in 1956, on the former grounds of a slaughterhouse. Commercial air service was provided by two airlines. There is also an area for private aviation, which receives various types of private flights as well as air ambulance flights, and the delivery of parcels and other valuables.\n\n\n=== Road network ===\nM\u00e9rida has four large internal roadways, which run from one end of the city to the other, and five smaller roadways. The largest is the combination of the Andr\u00e9s Bello and Urdaneta avenues. With a length of more than 8 km (5 mi), it runs from the neighborhoods of the central quarter of M\u00e9rida to the outskirts of Ejido. The other three correspond to Las Am\u00e9ricas and Alberto Carnevali avenues; 16 de septiembre and Tulio Febres Cordero avenues; and the corridor of Los Pr\u00f3ceres avenue.\nTwo national highways connect M\u00e9rida with other cities in Venezuela. The first is Troncal 7 or the Trans-Andes Highway, which runs to the city of Valera. This highway crosses the Andes by way of the valley of the Chama River, and, arriving at the region of Apartaderos, is crossed by Local 1. Finally, following the course of the Santo Domingo River, it arrives at the city of Barinas. The other national highway is the so-called Carretera La Variante. Upon arriving at the Estanques region it becomes Local 8 or Autopista Rafael Caldera. La Variante connects M\u00e9rida with El Vig\u00eda, and in turn, with the Pan-American Highway, thereby giving the city a connection with Colombia and with other important destinations, such as San Crist\u00f3bal and Maracaibo.\nIn addition to the national highways, three alternative routes exit the city of M\u00e9rida. The first, called the V\u00eda del Valle (Valley Road) links the city with the north, to various communities in the valley of the Culata, in the municipality of Santos Marquina. The second is an alternative route to the city of Ejido and other communities such as Jaj\u00ed and La Azulita; it is also a tourism route, with various lookout points facing M\u00e9rida in its initial section. A third minor route, used exclusively by rural vehicles, connects the city with the community of Los Nevados and with the Sierra Nevada National Park.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nAlong with a trolleybus rapid-transit system (still under construction and not fully open), the city relies on a vast system of urban and interurban bus routes which connect the city with its metropolitan area. The conventional bus routes traverse the various avenues of the city and cover a large percentage of the city's area. M\u00e9rida has one of Venezuela's best public transit systems; nevertheless, the system has become overwhelmed by increasing demand, and may be beginning to collapse. Among the existing routes, the route from the center of the city of Ejido to the center of the city of M\u00e9rida stands out, with a volume of thousands of passengers daily.\nThe bus routes are serviced by private companies, the majority of which are cooperatives or driver's associations, following the private model practiced in most of the cities in Venezuela. However, the prices charged are regulated by the city and supervised by the municipal organization for metropolitan transport. As is the practice throughout the country, the public transport system has special fares for senior citizens, and a student pass providing some of the lowest costs in the country.\nAfter years of study, the construction of a non-polluting mass transit system was proposed; the trolleybus was chosen as the most appropriate means of transport. Construction of the M\u00e9rida trolleybus system started near the end of the 1990s. The first line was inaugurated on June 18, 2007, with 15 of 34 proposed stations completed. This route serves Ejido and M\u00e9rida. The second line is in the planning stages and is expected to be 12 km (7 mi) long with 3 common stations alongside or crossing route 1. Route 3, an aerial cableway (originally planned to be a funicular), is a  3 km (2 mi) long route that will connect the community of Chama to a M\u00e9rida trolleybus station; construction has yet to begin. Once construction is completed, M\u00e9rida will be the first city in Latin America with under 500,000 inhabitants to have a rapid-transit system. The existing bus lines will be reorganized into 47 or so feeder routes, in order to provide better public transit to less-serviced areas.\n\n\n=== Regional transport ===\nThe only regional public transit available in M\u00e9rida is by bus. These depart from the city bus station. In addition, there are other private terminals from which private lines depart. From the central station one can take buses to destinations within the state, the region, and the rest of the country. Some of the most heavily used routes in the country start from this station, in particular, those that link M\u00e9rida with the city of Caracas. Though Venezuela is undertaking the construction of a national railway system, the IAFE, in order to link together the country, the city of M\u00e9rida is not projected to be a stop on this system: the nearest stop will be the city of El Vig\u00eda, some 60 km (37 mi) away.\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\nM\u00e9rida contains numerous historical squares, colonial houses, churches, and government buildings that make up most of its sightseeing spots. Moreover, the educational development of the city due, for the most part, to its university (ULA) has contributed to the creation of museums, libraries, and centers for scientific research, such as the Center for Astronomy Research (CIDA), located a few kilometers from the city in the mountains near Apartaderos.\n\n\n=== Monuments, public buildings, and historic places ===\nHouse of Former Governors\nThis colonial-style villa, located in the central quarter, was the official residence of the state governors.\nRectorate's Building\nSeat of the university's rectorate and Aula Magna.\nGovernment Palace\nThe government building, regional executive branch.\nPlaza Monumental Rom\u00e1n Eduardo Sandia\nThe Bullfighting Arena of M\u00e9rida was built in 1967. It has a capacity of 16,000 people and it is frequently used for cultural activities, besides serving its original purpose of bullfighting arena during the Sun Fairs.\nCable Car\nThe M\u00e9rida Cable Car is one of the main touristic spots. In its trajectory, it ascends from the central quarter to the Sierra Nevada. Currently, it holds two world records: one for being the longest cable car system in the world (12.5 km or 7.8 mi) and another one for being the highest cable car system in the world (4,367 m or 14,327 ft). The cable car was completed in 1958. It was closed in 2008 for construction of a new cable car system. It was reopened in April 2016.\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nM\u00e9rida has about two dozen religious buildings dedicated to Christianity, the most important of which are Catholic churches and chapels, since it is the religion with most number of followers in Venezuela.\n\nCathedral of M\u00e9rida\nThe city's Minor Basilica, built in Baroque style, similar to the Cathedral of Toledo, Spain. It is the main Catholic building in the city, where the Archbishop of M\u00e9rida presides the mass services.\nIglesia del Carmen\nThe oldest religious structure in M\u00e9rida, Our Lady of Carmen Church stands close to the Plaza Bol\u00edvar.

It houses the Archdiocesan Museum.\n\n\n=== Parks, squares, and sightseeing ===\n\nM\u00e9rida is famous nationwide for its great number of parks and squares, providing its inhabitants with access to nature. There are, at least, a dozen squares and two dozen parks, some of which are described below.\n\nBoulevard de los Pintores (Painters' Boulevard)\nOn this street painters congregate in order to create, exhibit, and sell their works.\nAquarium Garden\nThis aquarium exhibits both fresh and salt water fish.

This was the first sculpture constructed to honor Bol\u00edvar, in 1842. It was commissioned by the then-governor of the province, Gabriel Pic\u00f3n. It was erected to commemorate the moving of Bol\u00edvar's remains to the Pante\u00f3n Nacional in Caracas, from their previous resting place in the city of Santa Marta, Colombia, where Bol\u00edvar had been buried following his death in 1830. The monument consists of a pillar on which sits Bol\u00edvar's face in bronze.\nParque del Ej\u00e9rcito (Park of the Army)\nA small park, located in the south of the city, commemorating Venezuela's army. It has green areas, a fountain, and models of military tanks.\nParque La Isla (Island Park)\nSituated in the former location of a coffee plantation of the same name, the park was built in 1960 partly as an underwater park, and is 3.5 hectares in area. Its infrastructure is reminiscent to that of an island, offering kids play grounds, trails, and athletic courts. The park houses the largest convention center in the city, as well as the headquarters of Corpoandes (a government-run corporation that promotes development in the Andes region), facilities for cultivating orchids, and a museum dedicated to beekeeping.\nParque Las tres M\u00e9ridas (Three M\u00e9ridas Park)\nA small park that commemorates the three cities in the world named M\u00e9rida (in Spain, Mexico, and Venezuela).

According to legend, she still laments the death of her fianc\u00e9 Chief Murach\u00ed, who died bravely fighting the Spanish conquistadors. This park is located at the north end of Urdaneta avenue.\nPlaza Bel\u00e9n\nA small plaza, located to the northeast of the city center, in a neighbourhood of the same name. Its design, like that of most of the other plazas described here, follows the prototypical Spanish colonial style.\nPlaza Bol\u00edvar\nThe past and present main square of M\u00e9rida, it is surrounded by the most important public and historical buildings of the city.

It is located in front the Iglesia de Milla and near the army headquarters, northeast of the city center. It is dedicated to the independence hero Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, and it is frequently visited by locals and tourists alike, due to its convenient location among hotels, pensions, restaurants, stores, and ice cream parlors.\n\n\n== Gallery Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is a student city with a large percentage of its population found in classrooms, especially in the university area, where 20\u201330% of the population consists of students, and has a 0% illiteracy rate. It is the home of the University of the Andes, one of the most respected universities in the country, and the second to oldest. M\u00e9rida also contains various institutions of higher educations such as universities, university centers, polytechnic institutes, and university colleges, among others.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nThe University of the Andes, the most important in the city, was established in 1785, and offers undergraduate programs in art, sciences, literature, and humanities, long and short programs, as well as courses, degrees, post-graduate programs, specializations, diplomas, etc., bringing together more than 40,000 students and 6,000 professors. The university operates two campuses in M\u00e9rida, and about a dozen faculties spread throughout the city.\nTwo other more recently founded universities are based in M\u00e9rida: the Universidad Nacional Abierta (UNA), which offers undergraduate distance-learning courses; and, from 2006, the UNEFA, which is a military university specializing in Engineering for undergraduates.  The main university centers to be found in the city are given below:\n\nUniversity of the Andes (ULA)\nUniversidad Nacional Abierta (UNA)\nUniversidad Nacional Experimental de las Fuerzas Armadas (UNEFA)\nSantiago Mari\u00f1o Polytechnic Institute (IUPSM)\nColegio Universitario Hotel Escuela de Los Andes Venezolanos (CUHELAV)\nSantiago de los Caballeros de M\u00e9rida Institute (ISCM)\nAntonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre University Institute\nCrist\u00f3bal Mendoza Technological University Institute\nLa Frontera Technological Institute (IUFRONT)Primary and Secondary EducationThere are many institutions dedicated to primary and secondary education, most of which are public, under the control of the national or regional governments.  Of particular note is the Liceo Libertador. The largest education centers in the city can be found among the many private Catholic schools.  Colegio La Salle de M\u00e9rida and Colegio San Luis are among the largest with several hundred pupils each.  These are run by governing bodies Fundaci\u00f3n La Salle and Fundaci\u00f3n Don Bosco, respectively.  However, all schools come ultimately under the auspices of The Venezuelan Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n.\nOther educational institutions worth mentioning are the schools dedicated to languages, sport and music. M\u00e9rida is known as a destination to learn Spanish. In 2007 Jakera Spanish School was voted by the Language industry (STAR awards) as one of the top four Spanish schools worldwide. There are important conservatories, orchestras and choirs based in the city.  Most are linked to the universities and specialize in many kinds of instruments, as well as lyrical interpretation and the development of the singing voice. Amongst the language schools, of predominance are those that teach English, though French and Italian schools can also be found.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nThe greatest network of libraries is that of the University of the Andes. Each school has a specialized library, as well as the multidisciplinary libraries located in La Hechicera, the sports division, the administrative division, and a number of other smaller libraries, adding up to more than a dozen under the direction of Serbiula. Moreover, ULA owns the largest digital archive of the country, available to the public for research and education.\nBesides the university libraries, M\u00e9rida has the Biblioteca Bolivariana (Bolivarian Library), which is also an area of exhibits and historical displays, a branch of the National Library of Venezuela, and the public library Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, subsidized by the government. Other public and private institutions such as schools, churches, and language institutes have their own minor libraries to be used by their members.\nAdditionally, land originally set aside for a metropolitan library in 2006 was reallocated for the use of National Experimental University of the Armed Forces, and a new site for the proposed library has yet to be granted.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe city's culture closely resembles that of Andean Folklore and is in fact the main, if not defining, example of this folklore. Inhabitants of M\u00e9rida, with deep connections to their culture, are characterized by their well-preserved traditions and slow, unhurried way of life. The city itself can be recognized by its many well-preserved  colonial parks and buildings, in addition to its famous social scene, the local art and craftwork, and the unique regional cuisine.\n\n\n=== Museums, cultural centers, and theaters ===\nArchaeological Museum\nArchdiocesan Museum\nMuseum of Science and Technology\nMuseum of Colonial Art\nMuseum of Modern Art\nJuan F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez House of Culture\nTulio Febres Cordero Cultural Center\nC\u00e9sar Renginfo TheaterNot many know that the Archdiocesan Museum of M\u00e9rida houses the second and third oldest bells in the world, the so-called Ave Mar\u00eda bell from the year 909 and San Pedro of 912.\n\n\n=== Festivals and local customs ===\nIn addition to national holidays and events, several festivals take place and have origins in M\u00e9rida. Most are religious celebrations, and a few \u2013 such as the city's famous \"Feria del Sol\" or \"Sun Fair\" that takes place in the beginning of February \u2013 are of an international scale.\nFor M\u00e9rida, the most important and famous religious traditions are those celebrated by the city's Christian devotees during Christmas and Holy Week. These festivities include La Quema del A\u00f1o Viejo (Burning of the Past Year), La Pasi\u00f3n Viviente de Cristo (Christ's Living Passion) and La Paradura del Ni\u00f1o (Christ Child's Standing) celebrated with prayers, song, fireworks, wine and cake.\nAnother of the more popular local customs (those without official government sanction) are the Caravanas Estudiantiles, student processionals organized by and for high school or university graduates upon earning their degree. In recent years, this tradition has been extended to include younger students who have completed their primary or elementary education. Such celebrations usually occur during the first days of June for high school graduates, and throughout nearly the entire year for college graduates. Similar festivities can be found in other parts of the country, but the Caravanas of M\u00e9rida have a special relevance and importance given the city's large student population.\nOther customs firmly rooted in the M\u00e9ridan tradition, usually associated with fixed dates, include Patinatas Navide\u00f1as or \"Christmas skating\", which occurs in the city streets throughout the month of December; the Fiesta de las Velas on December 7 when in the evening all the electricity is turned off and some 18,000 candles are lit; the Fiesta de San Benito between January 12 and 31 celebrated with a drummers processions and street dancing; or the Vasallos de la Candelaria, another typical festivity with children and street dancing.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe cuisine of the M\u00e9rida region differs notably from that of the rest of the nation. Among the most notable differences is the arepa andina (Andean Arepa), a variant of the traditional Venezuelan arepa made from  wheat flour instead of the more common corn. This difference in ingredients is due primarily to the fact that the Andean region was one of the few places in the country where wheat historically has been harvested. Another notable dish is the pizca andina, common to M\u00e9rida, T\u00e1chira and the Colombian Andes, a soup with potato, milk, long onion, and parsley. Other important dishes are prepared with trout, the only fish found in the region.\nThe city's typical brightened sweets, made from a base of milk and other ingredients, are also notable. There is a historical tradition of such sweets, which are said to originate in the convents where they were prepared in the 19th century. Also, one can find alfajores, aliados, and almojabanas. Popular drinks include corn liquor, mistella, and \"donkey's milk\", which is known as \"Andean punch.\"\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe traditional music of the city is marked by waltz rhythms. It also includes regional or national rhythms, such as pasillos,  a type of merengue and bambucos. The music of M\u00e9rida, like its people, is recognizable by the laid back rhythms. The use of the violin and mandolin are almost mandatory in the music style.  Additionally, the city is commonly the birthplace of many rock and punk bands, among other genres. The city is also home to the M\u00e9rida State Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n== Entertainment and tourism ==\n\nM\u00e9rida is the quintessential touristic city in Venezuela, being one of the most sought-after destinations by national and international travelers.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\nLodging accommodations can be found to fit all budgets, including pensions and apartments for tourists with basic amenities. At least half of the hotels are located within the city, which is about 35% of the total number statewide.  All in all, there are about 2,650 beds available. Moreover, there will be three large five-star hotels added before 2007, when M\u00e9rida becomes the host of the soccer event Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\n\n=== Shops ===\nThe main commercial area of M\u00e9rida lies within the historic downtown. However, all kinds of services can be found in the suburbs. Two notable destinations by locals and tourists alike are M\u00e9rida's Mercado Principal (Main Market) and the Helader\u00eda Coromoto (Coromoto Ice cream Parlor). The Mercado Principal is famous for its variety of folk art, gastronomy, produce, groceries, and other local and regional goods. Helader\u00eda Coromoto is well known because it offers the greatest variety of ice cream flavors worldwide, with more than 800 choices.\n\n\n=== Shopping malls ===\nFor those who like to go shopping and spend the day enjoying stores or food courts, M\u00e9rida offers the following shopping malls: Las Tapias and Millenium located in Andr\u00e9s Bello Avenue; Alto Prado and Pie de Monte located in Los Pr\u00f3ceres Avenue; and Rodeo Plaza located in Las Am\u00e9ricas Avenue.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nAs a city with many students and tourists, M\u00e9rida enjoys a broad network of places open at night, mostly composed of clubs and bars. There are also various caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and two movie theaters. Furthermore, a number of cultural events constantly take place in these locations. Notable among these events are the concerts of the Symphonic Orchestra of M\u00e9rida, as well as concerts by local bands. Many of the night-clubs and discos open until late at night, with a few of them staying open until sunrise.\n\n\n== Media and communication ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThere are three television stations which broadcast from M\u00e9rida. Two of these are general-interest stations, airing programs including news, entertainment, and culture. The third is an institutional and educational channel and belongs to the Universidad de Los Andes.\nThe stations are:\n\nTelevisora Andina de M\u00e9rida, (TAM)\nULATV\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nThe principal radio stations of the state also broadcast from M\u00e9rida. These stations are mostly privately owned, though in recent years some public community radio stations have emerged.\n\n\n=== Press ===\nSome of the best-known newspapers from M\u00e9rida are:\n\nEl Correo de Los Andes\nCambio de Siglo [2]\nDiario Frontera [3]\nDiario Pico Bol\u00edvar [4]\nCultura Tatuy\n\n\n== Sports ==\nM\u00e9rida has a strong athletic infrastructure; noteworthy among others is the Guillermo Soto Rosa Stadium, an important soccer facility and the old headquarters of the local soccer team. During the last month of 2005, the city was host to the 2005 Andean National Games, an event for which numerous athletic facilities were built, including the Cinco \u00c1guilas Blancas (Five White Eagles) Sports Complex\u2014a 42 000-seat stadium and the current home stadium of the local team, Estudiantes de M\u00e9rida F. C.. Soccer is the most popular and widely supported sport, but given the city's location, a variety of extreme sports are also practiced as well.\nIn addition to the aforementioned soccer, the current athletic infrastructure also supports a wide array of other traditional sports, including tennis, basketball, baseball, and Venezuelan sports such as bolas criollas.\nThe Metropolitan Stadium of M\u00e9rida, dedicated on May 25, 2007 with a friendly match between Venezuela and Honduras, was host to the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\n\n== See also ==\nM\u00e9rida (state)\nLibertador Municipality, M\u00e9rida\n\n\n== References ==\nSecondary literature(in Spanish) Historia de M\u00e9rida, Carlos Chalbaud Zerpa, Universidad de Los Andes. 1985, M\u00e9rida, Venezuela.\n(in Spanish) Enciclopedia de Venezuela.

        "wiki": "Coyoac\u00e1n (US:  KOY-oh-\u0259-KAHN, Spanish: [ko\u029doa\u02c8kan] (listen)) is a municipality (alcald\u00eda) of Mexico City and the former village which is now the borough\u2019s \u201chistoric center.\u201d The name comes from Nahuatl and most likely means \u201cplace of coyotes,\u201d when the Aztecs named a pre-Hispanic village on the southern shore of Lake Texcoco which was dominated by the Tepanec people. Against Aztec domination, these people welcomed Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and the Spanish, who used the area as a headquarters during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and made it the first capital of New Spain between 1521 and 1523. The village, later municipality, of Coyoac\u00e1n remained completely independent of Mexico City through the colonial period into the 19th century. In 1857, the area was incorporated into the Federal District when this district was expanded. In 1928, the borough was created when the Federal District was divided into sixteen boroughs. The urban sprawl of Mexico City reached the borough in the mid 20th century, turning farms, former lakes and forests into developed areas, but many of the former villages have kept their original layouts, plazas and narrow streets and have conserved structures built from the 16th to the early 20th centuries. This has made the borough of Coyoac\u00e1n, especially its historic center, a popular place to visit on weekends.\n\n\n== Villa Coyoac\u00e1n or historic center ==\n\nTo distinguish it from the rest of Coyoac\u00e1n borough, the former independent community is referred to as Villa Coyoac\u00e1n or the historic center of the borough. Consisting now of 29 blocks, it is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Mexico City, located 10 km south of the Zocalo (main square) of Mexico City. This area is filled with narrow cobblestone streets and small plazas, which were laid out during the colonial period, and today give the area a distinct and bohemian identity. The area is filled with mostly single family homes, which were former mansions and country homes built between the colonial period to the mid 20th century. The Project for Public Spaces ranked the neighborhood as one of the best urban spaces to live in North America in 2005 and is the only Mexican neighborhood on the list. This area was designated as a \"Barrio M\u00e1gico\" by the city in 2011.The center of Coyoac\u00e1n is relatively peaceful during the week, but it becomes crowded and festive on weekends and holidays. After the Zocalo, the most-visited place in Mexico City is this historic center, especially the twin plazas in its center. According to the borough, the area receives about 70,000 people each weekend. The area is a stop for both the Turibus and Tranvia Turistico tour bus routes, on their routes through San \u00c1ngel, Ciudad Universitaria and other locations in the south of Mexico City. People come to enjoy the still somewhat rural atmosphere of the area as well as the large number of restaurants, cafes, cantinas, museums, bookstores and other cultural attractions. Some of these businesses have been around for almost a century. In the two main plazas and even in smaller ones such as the one in the neighboring Santa Catarina neighborhood. Mimes, clowns, musicians, folk and indigenous dancers, storytellers and other street performers can be found entertaining crowds. Vendors sell street food such as ice cream, homemade fruit drinks, esquites (flavored corn kernels) and corn-on-the-cob served with mayonnaise, lime, chili pepper and grated cheese, amaranth bars, and various candies. In the evening, food vendors tend to sell more hot items such as quesadillas, sopes, tortas, tostadas, pozoles and more. One known food vendor goes by the name of Rogelio. He is known for making pancakes (called hotcakes) in the shape of animals and humans. These are usually eaten as a snack with jam, cream and other toppings.\n\nThe tourism has been a mixed blessing for the historic center as commercial establishments open, helping the economy, but also push residents out. In the historic center, there are over 860 retail businesses, mostly restaurants, about 200 of which were established in the last five years. Residents attribute the growth to Mexico City's promotion of the area tourism in general as well as the opening of commercial centers in the borough. While the growing business helps the economy, resident groups fear that the area will lose its current character, as many businesses are opening in formerly residential buildings, with questionable legal basis. Currently, most of the borough, especially in historic center, is residential with older adults. Property prices are high, leading to sales not to new families but rather to larger commercial interests, squeezing out smaller businesses along with residents. Neighborhood groups have formed to confront the changes and preserve the historic value of the area. Another serious problem for the area is the traffic jams and serious lack of parking in the historic center. The quantity of cars and the lack of traffic patrols have meant the proliferation of \u201cfraneleros\u201d or people who illegally take possession of public areas such as streets to charge for parking.\n\nThe historic area is centered on two large plazas filled with Indian laurel trees called the Jardin del Centenario and the Jard\u00edn Hidalgo. These plazas cover an area of 24,000 m2, which were renovated, along with the areas around them in 2008. The green areas were rehabilitated, and areas were paved with red and black volcanic stone. Renovation of the two plazas and the streets around them cost 88.3 million pesos. For over twenty five years, these plazas, especially Plaza Hidalgo, and the streets around them were filled with vendors (wandering and with stalls). When renovation efforts began, 150 vendors were removed from the plazas proper with about 500 total including the surrounding streets. While the practice was illegal, it had been tolerated by authorities, even though it caused damage to the plazas and caused traffic problems. One of the main goals of the renovation work in 2008 was to remove these vendors and move them to a new crafts bazaar built nearby. Initially, opposition to the removal of the vendors came not only from the vendors themselves, but also from some neighborhood groups and local businesses who feared their removal would hurt tourism. When renovation work finished in 2009, police were assigned to the plazas to keep vendors from returning, leading to confrontations, both physically in the plazas and legally in the courts. The borough began to issue some permits for vendors, but there was opposition. Eventually, a group representing the vendors obtained a court order to allow forty vendors to return to the plazas, citing the history of tolerating such activity in the past. This order is still opposed by some neighborhood groups, but as of 2010, there are still a limited number of these vendors selling in the plazas.Plaza Hidalgo, also called Jard\u00edn (garden) Hidalgo is the main plaza or square of the borough. It is bordered by Calle Carillo Puerto on the east, Calle Caballocalco on the west, Calle B. Dominguez and the Casa Municipal on the north and the Plaza del Centenario and the Parish is San Juan Bautista on the south. In the center of the plaza, there is an early 20th-century kiosk with a stained glass cupola topped by a bronze eagle. This kiosk was donated to the then village by Porfirio D\u00edaz for the then-upcoming Centennial of Mexico's Independence in 1910. The eagle design is one adopted by Mexico after the French Intervention. As the plaza is named after Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a statue of the priest, created by Luis Arias can also be found on the plaza. Behind it is a sculpture carved from a tree trunk called \u201cLa Familia de Antonio Alvarez Portual y Josu\u00e9.The Plaza del Centenario (also called the Jard\u00edn del Centenario) is slightly smaller and located just west of the Plaza Hidalgo, separated by Calle Carrillo Puerto. This plaza originally was part of the very large atrium that belonged to Parish of San Juan Bautista during the colonial period. The main entrance to this atrium still exist on the west side of this plaza and are called the Arcadas Atrial or the Arcos del Jard\u00edn del Centenario. This entrance was built in the 16th century of stone with decorative motifs that show both European and indigenous influence. The current name for this area comes from the Centennial of Mexico's Independence. In the center of the plaza, there is a fountain which contains a bronze sculpture of two coyotes, which refer to the borough's name. The south side of the plaza is lined with cafes and restaurants, including the well-known Caf\u00e9 El Parnaso, and the north side features a very large crafts markets.\n\nThe Casa Municipal, also referred to La Casa de Cort\u00e9s, is a building located on the north side of the Plaza Hidalgo. It has served as an administrative/governmental building since it was constructed in the 18th century. The erroneous name of Casa de Cort\u00e9s (House of Cort\u00e9s, referring to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s), comes from Coyoac\u00e1n's association with the conquistador. Cort\u00e9s did live in Coyoac\u00e1n in 1521 and 1522, while the destroyed Aztec city of Tenochtitlan was being rebuilt into Mexico City, and the area was the capital of the colony of New Spain. However, Cort\u00e9s never lived at the site, despite a plaque on building that says that he did. Cort\u00e9s residence in Coyoac\u00e1n was on lands that belonged to the then leader of the indigenous of this area, Juan de Guzm\u00e1n Iztolinque, in the area where the La Conchita Church and plaza are found now. What Cort\u00e9s eventually built here where administrative buildings for the offices used to manage the vast lands he was granted as the Marquis del Valle de Oaxaca, which included the Coyoac\u00e1n area. Local legend states that this was the location were Cuauht\u00e9moc was tortured as the Spanish tried to learn of the whereabouts of more treasure.The current structure was built in the mid 18th century, by Cort\u00e9s\u2019 descendants, who still carried the title of the Marquis of the Valle de Oaxaca to replace the old structure, which had deteriorated. In the 1850s, the building began to be used as the seat of the government of the municipality of Coyoac\u00e1n, which then belonged to the State of Mexico, very separate from Mexico City. When the borough of Coyoac\u00e1n was created in 1928, as part of the Federal District, the building remained the government seat but of the modern \u201cdelegaci\u00f3n.\u201d The structure was declared a Colonial Monument by INAH in 1932.The structure is much the same as it was when it was constructed in the 18th century. The facade is simple and is fronted by a series of columns in sandstone and wood over which is a roof. The door and window jambs are typical of civil constructions of the 18th century with wrought iron work. The facade is topped by a wide cornice and inverted arches. At the very front is a sculpture of two coyotes in volcanic stone, the current logo of the borough. Above the entrance is the coat of arms granted to Coyoac\u00e1n by Charles IV of Spain. On one side of the building is the Sala de Cabildos, or City Council Hall. It was painted by Aurora Reyes Flores with a mural depicting pre-Hispanic Coyoac\u00e1n and includes depictions of the landscape of the area including the Xitle volcano, the Tepaneca god Xocotlhuetzin as well as the Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl. Next to this hall is an attached chapel. The mural in the chapel was done by Diego Rosales in 1961, depicting the early history of Mexico with personages such as Cuauht\u00e9moc, Cort\u00e9s, La Malinche and Pedro de Alvarado. Scenes of the work cover the walls and the ceiling.\n\nOne of the most important historic buildings in the borough is the Parish of San Juan Bautista. Built between 1520 and 1552, it is one of three oldest parish churches in Mexico City, along with the ones in Tlalpan and the small community of Amaqueman. Originally, this church and the cloister next to it were constructed as a monastery by the Dominicans, but the complex was transferred to the Franciscans. Over time, as the complex deteriorated and was reconstructed and restored various time, most was replaced so that now the only original parts from the 16th century are the choir area, the Rosario Chapel and the main altar. However, much of the same layout remains. The parish church has a large open chapel, but only a portion of the atrium it had in the 16th century. During much of the colonial period, the atrium functioned as a cemetery. Today, much of this atrium is now the Plaza del Centenario. The interior of the church has seven chapels, with the Rosario Chapel containing an ornate Baroque altarpiece from the end of the 17th century. The monastery portion is two floors surrounding a large inner courtyard. It conserves a large part of the original wood beams and decorative work in wood which was done by indigenous hands. The feast day for San Juan Bautista is 24 June. In the church a special altar is installed and mass is said all day. The most important mass occurs at midday with mariachi music, with a meal offered in the adjoining monastery building. The event is organized by 24 civil associations and the chaplains of the parish.\nIn 2005, the San Juan Bautista church underwent renovations to its tower, atrium, facade, portal for pilgrims, the north and south sides and the cupola and more under the supervision of INAH and academics from UNAM. Prior to this, there had been no restoration work to the building for about a century. The cupola was particularly damaged, with trees and other plants growing out of it. Much of the work was to make straight many of the walls and floors, which had cracked and warped. Studies were done on the building to determine what materials in what colors were used in order to use the same. It was declared a National Monument in 1934. The work was sponsored by government and private funds.Other landmarks off the plazas include the Museo Nacional de Culturas Populares, and the Acuavida Coyoac\u00e1n. The museum is located just off the Plaza del Centenario, and features mostly temporary exhibits related to popular or mass culture such as one related to lucha libre wrestling. The museum was created in 1982, to show the values and ways of live of the various modern cultural groups in Mexico. It has various halls, an auditorium and two courtyards in which are exhibitions, auditions, concerts, plays, recitals and craft workshops for children. The Acuavida Coyac\u00e1n Aquarium is on the north side of the Plaza del Centenario. It offers exhibits of fishes, reptiles, live coral, aquatic plants and more, including the only freshwater manta ray in captivity in the Americas.The rest of the historic center and nearby neighborhoods are filled with homes built from the colonia era to the middle of the 20th century, many of which have been catalogued for their historic value. Many of these homes can be found one two of the historic center's oldest streets, the Calle de Higuera, which leads southeast away from the Parish of San Juan Miguel and to the La Concepci\u00f3n neighborhood and Calle Francisco Sosa, which leads away from the same area towards San Angel. Calle Francisco Sosa alone has 65 structures catalogued by INAH for their historic value. One of the most important of these structures is the Casa de Ordaz, located on Calle Francisco Sosa on the corner with the Plaza de Centenario.) It was long thought to have belonged to conquistador Diego de Ordaz, who died in 1532, but research has shown that it was built sometime in the 18th century. Remodeling work was authorized on the Casa de Ordaz in 2004 by the INAH, but complaint stated that the owner, Banamex, gutted the interior and exceeded the limits set for the work by INAH. However, the chronicler of the borough, Luis Everaert, stated that the only original part of the building was the facade, which was not changed. The house underwent modification in the 1930s. In the 1920s, it was a school for girls, the first in Coyoac\u00e1n, In the 1930s, it was the Instituto Centroamericano, a middle school for boys. The Instituto Italiano de Cultura (Italian Cultural Institute) on Francisco Sosa Street is house in a structure built between the 17th and 18th centuries and remodeled in the 20th. This structure is an adobe and stone mansion with a flat red fa\u00e7ade with Moorish style decorative features. It has an inner courtyard with a tile decorated fountain and a private altar. It houses the cultural offices of the Italian Embassy. The main house of the San Pedro Mart\u00edr Hacienda is located off of Belisario Dominguez Street. The house is now divided into three independent parts, but they retain their original facades. In 1932, this house was where the Escuela de Pintura al Aire Libre (Open Air Painting School) was established, which was an important artistic movement.\n\n\n== The borough ==\n\nThe borough of Coyoac\u00e1n was created in 1928, when the Federal District of Mexico City was divided into 16 administrative parts. The borough is named after the old village of Coyoac\u00e1n, where the borough government is seated. This borough is much larger than the village, extending for 54.4km2 in the geographic center of the Federal District.  Accounting for 3.6% of the Federal District, it is the tenth largest borough. The borough is bordered to the north by the boroughs of Benito Ju\u00e1rez, Iztapalapa, Xochimilco, Tlalpan and \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n. Border roads include Avenida R\u00edo Churubusco, Calzada Ermita Iztapalapa, Calzada de la Viga, Canal Nacional, Calzada del Hueso, Avenida del Bordo, Calzado Acoxpa, Calzada de Tlalpan, Avenida de Pedregal, Anillo Perif\u00e9rico, Boulevard de las Cataratas, Circuito Universitario, Avenida Ciudad Universitaria, San Jer\u00f3nimo, R\u00edo Magdalena and Avenida Universidad.Sixty-nine percent of the land is residential, 60% is open or green space and the rest is mixed use or commercial. The borough contains 167,157 housing units with between two and four occupant, which is 7.5% of the total of the District.  It contains 7.2% of the total population of the Federal District. This population has fallen slightly from 640,423 to 628,063 (2000 to 2005) as the overall population of Mexico City has risen.However, quality of life in this borough his ranked among the top in the nation and has been ranked internationally. Coyoac\u00e1n was ranked third best place to live in the country in 2004 by the United Nations Development Programme, behind Benito Juarez and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda in Nuevo Le\u00f3n. The ranking is based on income levels, health and education. Coyoac\u00e1n was ranked sixth in education, fourth in income and fifth in health.  In quality of life, which takes into account factors such as crime statistics, Coyoac\u00e1n ranked second behind Benito Juarez in Mexico City. This ranks the quality of life as equivalent to that in developed countries. In 2004, Coyoac\u00e1n was ranked the fifth most livable neighborhood in North America, ahead of Rittenhouse, Philadelphia and behind Camden, Maine.  The borough contains 228 preschools, 227 primary schools, 103 middle schools, and 66 technical, preparatory and other high schools serving about 155,000 students. Illiteracy is lower here than in the rest of the Federal District at 1.9% for residents over the age of 15. About 55% of the population is of working age with less than 2% unemployed. 77.8% are employed in commerce and services, with 7% in industry; 44.8% of industrial jobs is related to pharmaceuticals with food processing accounting for 18.7%. However, industry accounts for 47.3% of the borough GDP, followed by services at 32.6% and commerce at 16.7%. As of 2004, the borough accounted for 4.1% of Mexico City's total GDP, but its industry accounts for 21% of industrial GDP. Tourism is an important part of the borough commerce and services sector. However, there are only nine hotels rated with three stars or above.\n\nMost of the borough located at 2240 meters above sea level with little variation. Minor elevations are located in Ciudad Universitaria, San Francisco Culuac\u00e1n and Santa \u00darusula Coapa. The most important elevation is in the far south called the Cerro Zacat\u00e9petl which rises to 2420masl. Parks and other green spaces cover 4,318,783.56m2 and can be found in most of the communities of the borough. Soil composition is of two types, of volcanic origin and the former lakebed of Lake Texcoco. Volcanic land is subdivided by volcanic rock which is decomposing and that which has not. The best known of the areas with still-hard lava rock is called the Pedregal, which covers the communities of the Ciudad Universitaria, the Pedregal de Carrasco, Santa \u00darsula Coapa, Copilco el Alto, Viveros de Coyocan and the Villa de Coyoac\u00e1n or historic center. The southeast of the borough is dominated by volcanic rock from an eruption of a now dormant volcano called Xitle. This lava bed covers the current communities of Colonia Santo Domingo, Colonia Ajusco and Pueblo de Santa \u00darsula. Decomposing volcanic rock is mostly found by the former lake.  The borough is part of the P\u00e1nuco River Basin, in the subregion of the Lake Texcoco Zumpango. The lake no longer exists except for a canal called the Canal Nacional which is on the east border. Two rivers pass through the territory called the R\u00edo Magdalena and R\u00edo Mixcoac. Both of these are almost fully encased in cement tubes as they pass through. These two rivers join to form the R\u00edo Churubusco on the border with Benito Ju\u00e1rez.The borough is divided into 140 communities, classified as colonias, pueblos, unidades habitacionales and barrios. The oldest of these divisions are former villages which are distinguished by their colonial era churches and who still celebrate their feast of their patron saint much as they did when they were independent, with fireworks, masses, processions, folk and indigenous dance and more. A number of these villages also have certain unique traditions associated with these celebrations. These barrios and pueblos can still be somewhat distinguished by their narrow, winding roads and alleyways. Culturally, they are still distinguished by having their own histories and legends.  Many of the old villages are linked by the old Calle Real, which was renamed Santa Catarina, then Benito Juarez and now Francisco Sosa. Today, this road extends from Plaza or Jard\u00edn Hidalgo to the Panzacola Bridge. This street used to have a trolley car that linked the historic center of Coyoac\u00e1n with San \u00c1ngel and Churubusco. At first this trolley was pulled by mules, but later it was electrified. Sometime after that, it was replaced by modern busses. Another main road in the borough is La Higuera, which links Plaza Hidalgo which the La Conchita Plaza.In additions to structures from the colonial era, Coyoac\u00e1n has important structure from the 19th century, replicas of colonial and 19th century buildings constructed in the 20th century and modern buildings. In total, the borough contains 349 registered buildings of cultural or historic importance, with 157 of these in the historic center. Coyoac\u00e1n  was declared a \u201cZona T\u00edpica y Pintoresca del Distrito Federal\u201d (Typical and Picturesque Zone of the Federal District) by INAH in 1934 due to is historical, cultural and artistic value. This declaration recognizes 278 buildings within the borough. This historic center has the most with fifty buildings on 86 blocks over 1.64km2.Despite its rural past with villages and farmlands, today the borough is urban, with all of its territory paved and developed with the exception of parks and other reserved green spaces as it is completely integrated with the urban sprawl of Mexico City. This has brought a number of problems to the area. Traffic in Coyoac\u00e1n is some of the worst in the city. While there are 70.7 km of primary roads through the borough, with 8,200,947m2 of pavement, many sections have maintained the narrow winding streets and plazas from its colonial past. These sections bring in a large number of visitors, especially on weekends and holidays, with these roads unable to cope with the volume of traffic and need for parking.  Other issues are graffiti and vandalism, and other crimes, the most serious of which is theft/robbery, followed by assault. However, Coyoac\u00e1n generates only 7.2% of all crime reports in Mexico City.\n\n\n== Other neighborhoods of the borough ==\n\nFor long before it became a borough, the area was home to a number of small community and villages. Vestiges of a number of these communities can still be distinguished by street layouts and by customs and traditions which have survived. Many of the old villages, now called colonias, pueblos and barrios (roughly \u201cneighborhood\u201d) are linked by the old Calle Real, which was renamed Santa Catarina, then Benito Juarez and now Francisco Sosa. Today, this road extends from Plaza Hidalgo to the Panzacola Bridge in Santa Catarina. This street used to have a trolley car that linked the historic center of Coyoac\u00e1n with San \u00c1ngel and Churubusco. At first this trolley was pulled by mules, but later it was electrified. Sometime after that, it was replaced by modern busses. Another main road in the borough is La Higuera, which links Plaza Hidalgo which the La Conchita Plaza in the La Concepci\u00f3n neighborhood.  These two roads, along with other colonial-era roads still have structures which are centuries old. Another street with a number of country mansions and homes is Calle de Fernandez Leal, mostly built at the beginning of the 20th century. A film called \u201cThe Matador, with Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear was filmed partly on the Plaza Santa Catarina.\n\n\n=== La Concepci\u00f3n ===\n\nOne neighborhood which is as old as the historic center is the La Concepci\u00f3n or La Conchita neighborhood (Barrio de la Concepci\u00f3n), an area where the Spanish conquistadors settled in the 1520s. The neighborhood centers on a small plaza with a church just southeast of Villa Coyoac\u00e1n or the historic center. This main chapel and plaza are called the Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n Chapel and the Plaza de la Conchita. This plaza is surrounded by very small streams still fed by a spring called Los Camilos. It is thought that Los Camilos once provided potable water to Tenochitlan. According to INAH, the plaza was a pre-Hispanic ceremonial center, upon which Cort\u00e9s had this chapel built. The first Catholic mass in Mexico City was celebrated here and according to tradition, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s\u2019 lover and translator, La Malinche, prayed here. The official name of the building is the Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n Chapel, but its more common name is La Conchita, a nickname for \u201cConcepci\u00f3n\u201d (literally, \u201cthe little shell\u201d).\nThe feast day for this neighborhood is 8 December. The fa\u00e7ade of the La Conchita Church is decorated with a large flower portal, usually donated by a sister community of Coyoac\u00e1n such as Los Reyes or La Candelaria. The festival begins with chamber music and then the patron image of the Virgin Mary is \u201cawakened\u201d with the song Las Ma\u00f1anitas as she is surrounded by numerous floral arrangements for mass. On the plaza in front of the church, wind bands play while participants share tamales and atole. Later in the night, student musical groups perform callejoneadas where they roam the streets playing music as a traveling party.Most of the area's oldest buildings are located on this plaza, Calle Fernando Sosa, which leads to Villa Coyoac\u00e1n and Calle Fernandez Leal. The Casa Colorada or Casa de la Malinche is located on a corner of the Plaza La Conchita, but it is not open to the public. It is said that Cort\u00e9s built it for La Malinche, and historians believe Cort\u00e9s had his Spanish wife, Catalina Ju\u00e1rez de Marcaida, murdered there. In spite of the house's historic and aesthetic value, it receives little attention. The reason for this is that La Malinche is often blamed for the downfall of the Aztec Empire, acting as a traitor to her own people.La Casa de los Padres Camilos (The House of the Camillo Priests) is on Calle Fernandez Leal in the Barrio de la Concepci\u00f3n. This structure was part of a farm and hospice which was owned by a Camillian religious order. The brothers cultivated a number of crops including fruit trees and flowers. Today the main house is used for commercial purposes but the building retains many of its original architectural details. It is a small stone-block building with a door made of black stone. A hall was added in the early 1900s. Opposite the Casa de los Camilos is the Jard\u00edn Frida Kahlo which has a statue of the painter and a fountain.On Calle Fern\u00e1ndez Leal you can also find the Elena Garro Cultural Center. Since its inauguration, on October 5, 2012, this space was conceived as a project of community life around books and a permanent offer of cultural activities that make available to visitors various expressions of the culture of Mexico and the world. The mansion of the early twentieth century, illuminated by its glass windows, calls readers to walk among its high shelves of two floors and to know its wide range of titles.\n\n\n=== Santa Catarina ===\n\nThe Santa Catarina neighborhood is home to a large number of Coyoac\u00e1n's landmarks. It is located just west of the Plaza del Centenario along Calle Francisco Sosa. It is a small square with a bright yellow chapel named the Capilla de Santa Catarina. This chapel was built for use by the indigenous population in the very early colonial period. The building today conserves some of the original built in the 1520s when it was originally built as an open chapel, and ornamental work done in the mid 17th century, when the nave with cannon vault was added. Later a tower and a linterna were added, but these fell in the 1985 earthquake. Inside there are 400-year-old murals. It was declared a National Monument in 1932. There are also several restored colonial era houses around it. On one side, there is Casa de Cultura de Coyac\u00e1n which hold art and cultural events. Once part of a hacienda, behind the building there are large gardens filled with vegetation.The Dolores del R\u00edo House is located on Salvador Novo Street in Barrio de Santa Catarina. It is also known as \u201cLa Econdida\u201d (The Hidden One), where Mexican actress Dolores del R\u00edo lived. It is neo-Colonial in design when it was built for her, but it has since been remodeled and has a more modern appearance. It still functions as a private residence.The Miguel Angel de Quevedo House is on Francisco Sosa Street in Barrio de Santa Catarina. It is a very large structure for the area, filled with trees and plants both inside and out. Originally, these gardens were watered with river flow from the R\u00edo Magdalena, but this river is no longer accessible because it is encased. It is still used as a residence.The Casa del Indio Fern\u00e1ndez House is located on Dulce Oliva Street in Barrio de Santa Catarina. The house was constructed over twenty years by architect Manuel Parra for Mexican filmmaker Emilio \u201cIndio\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez, who died in the house in 1986. The house is colonial in style with a facade constructed from volcanic rock. Today it belongs to Fernandez's daughter, Adela.The Casa de Cultura Jes\u00fas Reyes Heroles is located on Francisco Sosa, named after a historian and political scientist from Veracruz. The house is on a property, which was called Izotitl\u00e1n, meaning \u201cizotes\u201d a type of wild palm to make hats. In the colonial period, the house belonged to Juan de Luis Celis who had a small paper factory.  It changed hands several times by the 20th century, but all this time, the structure kept its original appearance including very old atrium cross in the first courtyard. In the 1940s, it was enlarged, but its colonial style was respected. The building gained its current function in 1985, when President Miguel de la Madrid donated the house and lands to create a cultural center.  Today, the center has three art galleries, named after Alfredo Ramos Martinez, Guillermo Kahlo and Miguel Alvarez Acosta to house temporary exhibits, an area to teach the culinary arts and two multiuse rooms. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Casa de Cultura Jes\u00fas Reyes Heroles was inhabited by Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n Armida, who is being considered for beatification by the Catholic Church. It is said that she performed a number of miracles in this house. Behind this house is the Callej\u00f3n del Aguacate, which is said to be haunted by the ghost associated with the woman, and local school children are known to go looking for the ghost.The San Jos\u00e9 del Altillo Church is located on the corner of Avenida Universidad and Miguel Angel de Quevedo. This area was once the El Altillo Hacienda. This hacienda was donated by its last owner, Aguayo Pi\u00f1a to the Misioneros del Esp\u00edritu Santo religious order in the very early 19th century. Here they founded the Centro de Espiritualidad San Jos\u00e9 del Altillo spiritual center. Today, the church site has a modern structure on it, built by architect Enrique de la Mora.According to legend, the San Antonio Panzacola Chapel was built by the mother of a group of smugglers to fulfill a promise or to offer gratitude.  It is also said that it was the transfer point and a customs checkpoint for goods heading from Coyoac\u00e1n and San Angel to Mexico City.The Casa Alvarado is now the home of the Fonoteca National or National Sound Library. Octavio Paz died here in 1998.The \"Alfredo Guati Rojo\" National Watercolor Museum is dedicated to watercolor paintings. It was founded by Cuernavaca-born watercolor artist Alfredo Guati in 1967. Originally located in Colonia Roma, it was moved to its current location near Santa Catarina after the 1985 earthquake.\n\n\n=== Colonia del Carmen ===\n\nColonia del Carmen was not a village in the past. It was built in 1890 and named in honour of Carmen Romero, the wife of then president Porfirio D\u00edaz, and it is best known for having several of the borough's museums and other landmarks. The Del Carmen colonia has had an intellectual and vanguard reputation since the 1920s, when it was the home of Salvador Novo, Octavio Paz, Mario Moreno and Dolores del R\u00edo. The Frida Kahlo Museum, popularly called \u201cLa Casa Azul\u201d (The Blue House) is one of the most popular sites in Coyoac\u00e1n. It is a deep blue house on Londres Street, built in the early 20th century in which Frida Kahlo was born in 1907 and in which she spent the last thirteen years of her life. The house contains a selection of Kahlo's personal art collection and a large collection of pre-Hispanic artifacts, Mexican folk art (mostly indigenous inspired jewelry and clothes which she wore) and works by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco, Paul Klee and Diego Rivera. The museum also contains a caf\u00e9 and a small gift shop. The Kahlo pieces are some of her minor works and include El Marxismo Dar\u00e1 la Salud, which shows her casting away her crutches. There is an unfinished portrait of Joseph Stalin, who became a hero to Kahlo after Rivera had a falling out with Russian Communism theorist Leon Trotsky. In this portrait, Stalin stands before a wheelchair. The folk art collection contains Rivera's collection of retablos.The Leon Trotsky Museum is located near the Frida Kahlo Museum. Trotsky was forced into exile in 1929 by Josef Stalin and in 1937, due to efforts by Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, he was granted asylum in Mexico. At first, Trotsky and his wife lived in the La Casa Azul with Frida, but after a falling out with Diego Rivera, the couple moved to this house on Viena Street in 1938.  The house looks like a fortress, and it was fortified to protect Trotsky from assassins. It has high outer walls and watchtowers once occupied by armed guards. Inside, there is a small house and garden. The house and garden were original with the defenses added later after an attack led by David Alfaro Siqueiros, who shot up the house. Trotsky and his wife survived by hiding under furniture. The bullet holes from this attack remain on the outer walls of the house.However, in 1940, a Spanish Stalin supporter by the name of Ram\u00f3n Mercader managed to gain entry to the house and to kill Trotsky with a mountaineer's ice axe. The room in which Trotsky was killed remains exactly as it was at that moment, including the papers and the books in their exact positions. As a museum, some other buildings were added along the walls which contain photos from Trotsky's lifetime, biographical notes in Spanish and memorabilia such as Trotsky trademark small round glasses. In the garden, there is a tomb which contains Trotsky's and his wife's ashes.   The complex also houses the Instituto del Derecho de Asilo y las Libertades P\u00fablicas (Institute for the Right of Asylum and Public Liberties) which was founded in 1990 and the Rafael Galv\u00e1n Library, which contains a collection of books with social themes. These organizations occasionally sponsor events such as expositions and conferences.The Escuela Superior de M\u00fasica (Higher School of Music) on Fern\u00e1ndez Leal Street in Colonia Del Carmen is an imitation of the house occupied by Shakespeare's Othello. It stands out due to its many stained glass windows with Arab phrases inscribed against a stucco facade.  This school used to be a pulqueria called La Rosita, which was frequented by intellectuals in the area. When this bar was demolished, it took with it a mural done by Diego Rivera.The La Capilla Theater is on Madrid Street in Colonia Del Carmen. This building was part of the ruins on a portion of an old hacienda purchased by Salvador Novo around 1950. In the ruins of this structure he visualized a theater and hired Alejandro Prieto to make the adaptation. This theater was opened to the public in 1953 along with a restaurant called El Reflectorio alongside. Later a bar called El Habito, today called El Vicio was added. The theater remains as one of the more important cultural venues in the borough.The Ju\u00e1rez Institute is located on the corner of Cuauhtemoc and Abasolo Streets. It was built in the 19th century. Originally, this was part of a Presbyterian church complex, but this church has since moved to another location on Cuauhtemoc street. Today, it houses an educational institution. The building is two floors, with a sober facade made of stone and brick. The sides are framed by sandstone, with the main entrance on Cuauhtemoc. The interior has a large courtyard which contains gardens.The Coyoac\u00e1n Market was built in 1956 by Pedro Ram\u00edrez V\u00e1zquez in a Functionalist style on a site which originally was stables and horse corrals.\n\n\n=== Churubusco ===\n\nThe Churubusco neighborhood has the historic Dieguinos monastery located near the ancient road to Iztapalapa. In the pre-Hispanic period, this area was a small island, which was called Teopanzolco, at the juncture of Lake Texcoco and Lake Xochimilco. In the 17th century, the Spanish built the monastery of Churubusco over a ceremonial site dedicated to the god Huitzilopochtli. This monastery complex is best known for its role during the Mexican\u2013American War. The Mexicans, aided by the \"Saint Patrick's Battalion\", a military unit composed of catholic immigrants (mainly Irish), had fortified the monastery and fought until they ran out of ammunition and then beaten only after hand-to-hand combat. When U.S. General David Twiggs asked Mexican General Pedro Mar\u00eda de Anaya to surrender his ammunition, the reply is said to have been \"If there were any, you would not be here.\" There is a memorial to this event outside the main entrance and a plaque commemorating the \"Irish martyrs\". The monastery's church still retains its original function, but the most of the rest of the complex is now the Museo Nacional de las Intervenciones. The collection includes an American map of the facility from 1847, artifacts from the French Intervention in Mexico and a plot by Henry Lane Wilson to bring down the government of Francisco I. Madero in 1913.The Casa de Cristo (House of Christ) is located on Heroes Street in Churubusco. It was constructed in 1906 as a residence for Bertha Vizcayno de Vergara who remained there until 1967. Today, it is still private property but is used as a restaurant. It has three floors and twelve rooms, with walls of brick and limestone and wood roof decorated with tiles. The front has sandstone Ionic columns. The name comes from the inscription of \"Casa de Cristo\" over the main entrance.\n\n\n=== Pueblo de los Reyes, La Candelaria and other traditional \u201cbarrios\u201d ===\n\nWhile lacking in landmarks, La Candelaria and Los Reyes are considered to be the two most traditional communities in the borough, with mostly religious traditions that extend back into the colonial period. Much of Los Reyes\u2019 traditions revolve around a crucifix imaged called the Se\u00f1or de las Misericordias. According to legend, sometime in the 18th century, residents of Santiago Zapotitlan, today in Tlahuac borough, were carrying the image to Mexico City for restoration. Upon encountering a business producing pulque, they decided to go inside after leaving the image in a supposedly secure place. When they were done drinking, they could not find the image where they left it or anywhere nearby.  A few days later a \u201ctlachiquero\u201d (one who takes nectar out of maguey plants) heard a child's cry in the area and found the image. Word went out to try to find which church the image belonged to.  Representatives of various communities come to claim it, but none could lift the image. When it was the turn of the Pueblo de los Reyes, they prayed that the image would be light as a feather for them and the easily lifted it. The returned home joyous to have been chosen by the image. Later, representatives of Santiago Zapotitlan came to reclaim the image, but again it became too heavy to lift and it has remained in the church ever since. The festival called the Recibimiento del Se\u00f1or de las Misericordia occurs in September in both Los Reyes and La Candelaria. It celebrates the arrival of the image according to the legend. From June until September, the image is sent out to visit various communities in the borough. During the ceremony to return the image to its home church, the people of La Candelaria bring the image and the people of Los Reyes receive it with much fanfare.\n\nOn 6 January in the Pueblo de los Reyes, the main square of the community is decorated with flower portals and \u201ccarpets\u201d made by carefully arranging colored sawdust on the ground. There are also processions and a ceremony called the \u201cv\u00edtor\u201d used to announce coming of the festival. Reeds are cut and decorated with multicolored crepe paper and half inflated balloons and then are given to children as they pass by on the streets. There is also a parade that features \u201cmojigangas\u201d which are large structures made of cardboard and paper in the shape of human figures. These are hollow and placed on the shoulders of parade participants. An image of the Nativity and the Three Wise Men is carried through the town on a truck from which bags of candies are tossed to children.The image for the La Candelaria neighborhood is an image of the Virgin Mary called the \u201cVirgen de la Candelaria.\u201d The feast day for this image occurs on 2 February in the Pueblo de la Candelaria. This event is organized by a \u201cmayordomo\u201d who is chosen each year and last for ten days.  It includes religious activities such as a novena and a special Mass. It also includes cultural, sporting and recreational activities, which also gives the event the alternate name of \u201cLa Semana Cultural de La Candelaria\u201d (Culture Week of La Candelaria). During Holy Week, La Candelaria holds a passion play which runs about 4 km from the main plaza to the Huayamilpas Ecological and Recreational Park.The feast day of Francis of Asisi, patron of the Barrio Cuadrante de San Francisco is announced by a band playing wind instruments playing through the streets. In addition to more common elements, the celebration also includes the lighting of the candle of three large wooden crosses, performed by groups performing indigenous dances such as Concheros.  The crosses are eventually surrounded by a multitude of candles in the night as people pray. The origin of this tradition is unknown.The feast day of Saint Ursula, patroness of Santa Ursula Coapa last for about a week. The first three days are dedicated to 40 hours of prayer. Other religious events include processions on Calzada de Tlalpan and the blessing of taxi drivers. Cultural and recreational activities include a marathon, fireworks, including those on large frames called \u201ctoritos\u201d (little bulls) and \u201ccastillos\u201d (castles), indigenous and folk dancing including Concheros, Santiagueros and Chinelos, and music played by wind bands especially from neighboring Tepepan and San Lucas Xochimanca.Other traditional neighborhoods include San Lucas, San Mateo, El Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas, San Francisco and San Antonio. The San Lucas and San Mateo barrios are sliced through by small arroyos and used to be surrounded by cornfields and pastures for cattle. The El Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas and San Francisco barrios are filled with very winding alleyways over black volcanic rock, called pedregal, from an ancient eruption of Xitle. These two are separated from the historic center by Avenida Miguel A de Quevedo. The San Antonio barrio is very small with an equally small chapel by the name of San Antonio Panzacola. This chapel belonged to the Carmelites and is located alongside an old stone bridge over the R\u00edo Magdalena.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name comes from the Nahuatl original \u201cCoyohuac\u00e1n\u201d. It is most often translated as \u201cplace of coyotes\u201d but other possible translations such as \u201cskinny coyote\u201d and \u201cplace of wells\u201d and \u201cland of the water of the jackal or coyote\u201d have also been proposed. The area's Nahuatl glyph prominently depicts the figure of a coyote in profile, with its tongue hanging out and down halfway across the body where it curls. This tongue position often indicates hunger or thirst, but can also indicate tiredness. This glyph was likely devised when the pre-Hispanic settlement was founded around the 10th and 12th century.In the pre-Hispanic period, Coyoac\u00e1n was originally an independent dominion or altepetl. It was a major center of trade on the southern shore of Lake Texcoco. Its people were Tecpanecas, who were farmers and stoneworkers specializing in the volcanic stone from the old lava flow of Xitle. It had been a Tepaneca dominion for 300 years until the Aztecs took over in the 15th century. Famous rulers were Maxtla and his son Tecollotzin.\nThe Aztecs gave the area its current name; however their rule was hated by the native Tepanecas, who welcomed Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and the Spanish, allowing them to use this southern port on Lake Texcoco as a headquarters during the conquest of Tenochtitlan.\nAfter the Aztec capital was destroyed, Cort\u00e9s remained in Coyoac\u00e1n and made it the first capital of New Spain from 1521 to 1523. During the colonial period, the village remained independent of Mexico City, separated by farmland and lakes, filled with haciendas and monasteries. This allowed the area to maintain many of its plazas and narrow cobblestone streets to this day. During the sixteenth century and into the seventeenth, there was an active Spanish land market in Coyoac\u00e1n, with many bills of sale in Nahuatl found in the archives. Rebecca Horn found over 100 such bills of sale naming Nahua men and women selling to Spaniards.  Natives also dictated last wills and testaments in Nahuatl the colonial era, which further contribute to our understanding of continuities and changes in Nahuas' situation in the colonial era. The altepetl (town) of Coyoac\u00e1n continued to assess tribute on the basis of the size of a person's land holdings long after Spaniards had switched to a head tax. The earliest extant native pictorial of Coyoac\u00e1n, the so-called C\u00f3dice de Coyoac\u00e1n, dating from a 1553 visita (inspection) gives a baseline for tribute and labor.One important monastery was the Churubusco monastery, at which the Battle of Churubusco took place on August 20, 1847, during the Mexican\u2013American War. Ten years later, the area became part of the Federal District of Mexico City when it was expanded by the 1857 Constitution.From the rest of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th, Coyoac\u00e1n remained separate from Mexico City proper, keeping its rural reputation and gaining one for cantinas and pulque bars. During the Mexican Revolution, Victoriano Huerta was sometimes found in cantinas here, proclaiming that the \u201conly foreigners welcome (in Mexico) were Hennessy and Martell.\u201dThe historic center and other villages were linked to each other and Mexico City proper by rail lines and trolleys. The rail line linked Mexico City and the historic center from the 1860s to the early 1900s.  Many of the old villages were linked by a trolley on Santa Catarina Road, now Francisco Sosa. This trolley was initially pulled by mules but later it became electrified.  In the 1920s, areas of the borough became a magnet for artists and intellectuals after being promoted by Francisco Sosa. Over time, it attracted names such as Salvador Novo, Octavio Paz, Mario Moreno (aka Cant\u00ednflas), and Dolores del R\u00edo, exiles such as Leon Trotsky and Romania's King Carl, as well as its two most famous residents, Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. Leon Trotsky lived close by Rivera and Kahlo and was murdered by one of Stalin's agents. Rivera and Kahlo's presence gave the area a bohemian reputation. In 1923, the Escuela de Pintura al Aire Libre (Open Air School of Painting) was established at the former San Pedro Mart\u00edr Hacienda, establishing the area as an artists\u2019 enclave.  From the 1920s to the 1940s, the area was a mix of rural farms and upper-class families who were building mansions and country homes.  In the 1930s, Attending mass on Sundays was a must although attendance was segregated by social class and age. It was commons for the youth to go to the Cine Centenario movie theatre (now a Sanborns) after Mass. Some youths, called \u201cVanguardias\u201d preferred to meet on Thursdays and Sundays in private home to watch alternative films such as documentaries and animated features. Other forms of entertainment included picking fruit from trees or horse racing on Xicotencatl Street. The main street market, or tianguis, for the area was called Luis Mondrag\u00f3n, which installed each Friday where the Coyoac\u00e1n gymnasium is now, selling food stuffs, domestic animals and other necessities. There were also about 25 pulque bars or pulquer\u00edas.\n\n\n=== Absorption into the Distrito Federal and twentieth- and twenty-first century developments ===\nThe area was officially designated the Mexico City borough of Coyoac\u00e1n in 1928.  By the mid 20th century, the urban sprawl of Mexico City began to envelop the borough, much as it was doing to other former villages and municipalities in the Federal District such as Tacuba, Tacubaya, Mixcoac and others. The rural economy gave way as fields and orchards were built over, as well as the remaining lake and conifer forests. This has deforested the area and depleted the soil leaving very little wildlife. There have been efforts to cultivate human-planted forests, mostly of eucalyptus and other trees in areas such as Zacat\u00e9petl, which had been completely deforested.This integration into the city proper has brought with it big city problems. The first is that redevelopment will take over areas which still maintain some of their rural or village feel, which has happened in other formerly independent communities.  In 2008, neighborhood groups worked against the construction of new apartment complexes in the borough in order to halt further urbanization.  The area's popularity, both as a place to live and as a place to visit on weekends, along with its narrow winding streets has caused it to have some of the worst traffic problems in the city, with traffic jams and parking problems. In spite of the fact that there are six parking garages in the historic center, drivers in the area still jockey for spaces on the street. The six public garages are always full. This makes for big business for establishments which offer valet parking and for franeleros. Franeleros are people who illegally take over public street parking and charge for it. The \u201cfraneleros\u201d charge to \u201ctake care of vehicle\u201d but also threaten to damage those who refuse to pay.  There are an estimated 250 franeleros working the borough, and in 2010, the city government proposed regulating them instead of eliminating them, which the residents of Coyoac\u00e1n and neighboring San Angel have strongly rejected. One last issue is the proliferation of unauthorized street vendors and tianguis markets.During the 2000s, the city and borough have done major rehabilitation and reconstruction work in the borough, especially in the historic center, renovating plazas, colonial buildings and streets. This work moved to areas in and around the Plaza Hidalgo and Plaza del Centenario in 2008, with the main goals being the redesign of the plazas, the renovation of the Parish of San Juan Bautista and the removal of street stalls in and around the plazas. Opposition to the removal of the vendors came not only from the vendors themselves, but also from some neighborhood groups and local businesses who feared their removal would hurt tourism.  In March 2008, the two plazas were closed off by authorities for renovation work, forcing the removal of more than 500 street stalls for renovation of the two plazas and the streets around them costing 88.3 million pesos. When the plazas reopened in 2009, there were confrontations between the vendors and authorities, both on the plazas with police and in the courts, despite the fact that the borough built a nearby bazaar on Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Vendor's groups eventually obtained a court order to allow for about forty vendors in the plazas, citing the 25 years or so when about 150 vendors were tolerated on the premises, even though this order is opposed by residents\u2019 groups. As of 2010, most vendors remain off the two plazas proper.In 2010, the borough hosted an event in the Jard\u00edn Hidalgo where the Guinness Record for largest mug of hot chocolate in the world was broken.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary schools ===\nReino de Jordania\nTecayehuatzin]\nProfessor Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog\nRep\u00fablica de Checoslovaquia\nActiva Paidos\nRep\u00fablica de Guatemala\nRep\u00fablica de Finlandia\nProfessor Fernando Brom Rojas\nCentenario de Ju\u00e1rez\nRep\u00fablica de Suazilandia\nProfessor Samuel Delgado I.

Designed by architects Mario Pani and Enrique del Moral, it was built in the 1950s to move the university from the scattered colonial buildings in the historic center of Mexico City.\nIt was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007. \nThe Biblioteca Central (Central Library) is a large rectangular prism in the center of the campus. It was built by Gustavo Saavedra, Juan Mart\u00ednez and Juan O'Gorman. O\u2019Gorman was in charge of decorating the four sides with multicolored mosaics of stone pieces brought from all parts of Mexico. The murals relate to the history of Mexico. The north side reflects the pre-Hispanic period; the south reflects the colonial period and the east is from the modern period. The west side is meant to represent Mexico today with the coat of arms of the university in the center with Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos\u2019 motto of \u201cPor mi raza hablar\u00e1 mi esp\u00edritu\u201d (For my race, speaks my spirit.). These mosaics are the largest of their type in the world.The Torre de Rector\u00eda (Dean's Tower) is the main administration building for UNAM. It was designed by Mario Pani, Enrique del Moral and Salvador Ortega as a tower of glass and marble, decorated with three-dimensional murals by David Alfaro Siqueiros, mixing painting and sculpting. The north side has a piece entitled \u201cEl Pueblo a la Universidad y la Universidad al pueblo\u201d (People to the University and University to the People). The work on the south side is called \u201cEstudiantes que extiende sus brazos a la cultura\u201d (Students who extend their arms to culture). On the east side is an unfinished work related to the culture of Mexico.The Centro Cultural Universitario was built between 1976 and 1980 by engineers and architects of the school headed by Arcadio Artis Espiritu and Orso Nu\u00f1ez Ruiz Velasco. It was created to house facilities related to various art forms and by artists from all over the world as well as Mexico. It is built over volcanic rock, oriented north-south and is surrounded by desert vegetation. The main entrance on Avenida Insurgentes contains a mural by Carlos M\u00e9rida. The complex contains the National Library and National Periodical Collection, the Instituto de Estudio Bibliogr\u00e1ficos, the Coordinacion de Diffusion Cultural and the Julio Torre Bookstore/Caf\u00e9.The Estadio Ol\u00edmpico M\u00e9xico 68 is the main sports facility built for the Olympic Games of 1968 held in Mexico City. It was constructed to simulate a volcanic cone with a wide crater. The high relief decoration in the front was designed by Diego Rivera and created as a mosaic using naturally colored stones. Today, the stadium is the home of the Pumas professional soccer team.The Sala Nezahualc\u00f3yotl is a concert hall and the main site for the UNAM philharmonic orchestra. The building was inaugurated in 1976. It was designed acoustically to allow the orchestra to be in the center of the hall and seats 2311 people around a 240m2 stage.The Sala Migual Covarrubias y Carlos Ch\u00e1vez is used primarily for dance recitals but has also hosted operatic events, musical theater, and stage plays.The Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n Theater and Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz Forum were both inaugurated in 1979 as space for cultural events under the same roof. They have a capacity of 430 and 120 spectators respectively. The Forum does not define stage and audience space so that the facility can be adapted to a number of different arrangements. The stage of the Theatre, with its 12-meter walls, can be disassembled partially or fully.The Espacio Escult\u00f3rico or Sculpture Space is a monumental sculpture made of 64 stone triangular blocks arranged in a circle such that from above, it looks like a crown.  Inside this space is exposed naturally occurring volcanic stone. The outside of the sculpture retains its natural vegetation.  The idea is to combine nature and art and represents the cosmology of pre-Hispanic Mexico.The Universum Museo de Ciencias is an interactive museum with 315 exhibits related to the natural  and physical sciences. Halls are named for mathematics, chemistry, energy, biological diversity, agriculture and food, ecology, human biology and health, Science in the big city, animal behavior and society and more.Running across the borough from the east end and ending in the west near the university campus is Avenida Miguel Angel de Quevedo. This street is lined with bookstores, such as Nalanda, El Sotano de Coyoac\u00e1n, \u201cOctavio Paz\u201d and two branches of the Gandhi chain. The first was one of the Gandhi stores, placed in 1973 at the site of a former supermarket. The bookstores are here because the area is close to the Ciudad Universitaria and the student population that lives in the area. The bookstores have attracted other cultural businesses such as theaters cafes and restaurants. The second Gandhi store, called Gandhi 2000, was built to be a cultural center as well as a bookstore with literature related events, children's activities, concerts and more. It also has a series of nude sculpture by Gabriel Ponzanelli.Ciudad Universitaria is very large, so you might need a Ciudad Universitaria's map.\n\n\n== Other landmarks in the borough ==\n\nThe Viveros de Coyoac\u00e1n is located on the west side of the borough just north of the Ciudad Universitaria. This land once belonged to Miguel Angel de Quevedo, but they were nationalized under President Venustiano Carranza and today it serves as a park and a plant nursery for trees used in reforestation projects. It is the first plant nursery of its kind in Mexico. Today, it not only germinates and grows trees for reforestation projects, it is considered to be one of Mexico City's \u201clungs.\u201d This and other areas serve to recharge aquifers and add oxygen to the air. In the past, this park was also home to the first Escuela Nacional de Tauromaquia (National School of Bullfighting).Centro Nacional de las Artes (National Arts Center) is located on Avenida Rio Churubusco just east of Calazada de Tlalpan. It contains the Blas Galindo Auditorium, the Teatro de las Artes, two other theaters, the national music conservatory as well as schools of theater, dance, cinema, painting, sculpture and engraving. The building is modern. It has a bookstore and art materials shop open to the public.\n\nAnahuacalli is a museum designed by Diego Rivera to house his personal collection of pre-Hispanic art. It also contains some of his own work as well. The building is towering and fortress-like made of volcanic stone, incorporating stylistic features from several pre-Hispanic cultures. The name means \u201chouse of An\u00e1huac\u201d An\u00e1huac was the Nahuatl name for the Valley of Mexico. The exhibits are mostly pottery and stone figures and other pieces chosen for their artistic value. Rivera's works on display are murals on the walls and ceilings, studies of major murals done in other locations such as El Hombre en el Cruce de los Caminos, which reflects the original El Hombre, Controlador del Universo, which is in the Palacio de Bellas Artes.The Casa del Sol (House of the Sun) was constructed by the Aguilar and Quevedo families. In this house, Venustiano Carranza composed the Constitution of 1917. Legend says it was originally a country home for Miguel Angel de Quevedo. Today it is a privately owned building with a restaurant and catering business.The Casa de Cultura Ra\u00fal Anguiano is located in the Pedregal area on a property with a 2 hectare lake.  It is named after a Mexican artist whose work reflected the country's political and artistic history. The Casa de Cultura Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n was opened in 1986 with the name of Casa del Pueblo. Its currently named after a journalist and ideologue from the Mexican Revolution.  This building is one of the few built specifically to be a cultural center to serve the eastern side of the borough, which is densely populated due to apartment complexes such as the CTM Infonavit Culhuacan and the Alianza Popular Revolucionaria. The building contains a stage theater, a multipurpose room, an open-air theater and a library. Other museums in the borough include the Museo de Arte Escult\u00f3rico Geles Cabrera on Xicotencatl Street in Colonia del Carmen, the Museo del Autom\u00f3vil on Avenida Division del Norte in Pueblo de San Pablo Tepetlapa, the Museo del Retrato Hablado on Avenida Universidad in Colonia del Carmen, Museo Cultural de las Artes Graficas on Calzada de Tlapan in Barrio de San Diego Churubusco and the  Museo Alejandro Galindo on Avenida Santa \u00darsula in Colonia Santa \u00darsula. Other theaters includeTeatro Rafael Solana on Miguel Angel de Quevedo in Barrio del Cuadrante de San Francisco, Foro de la Conchita Forum on Vallara in the center, the Teatro Santa Catarina in Barrio Santa Catarina,  the Teatro Coyoac\u00e1n /Foro Rodolfo Usigli on Heroes Street in Barrio de San Mateo Churubusco, Teatro La Capilla on Madrid in Colonia del Carmen, Centro Nacional de las Artes in Calzada de Tlalpan in Colonia Country Club.Estadio Azteca, located in the Santa Ursula area, is the home of the Club Am\u00e9rica and Mexican national soccer teams.  It is also used for other events, including concerts, and hosted two FIFA World Cups.  The rivalry is known as the Clasico Capitalino is centered around the Coyoac\u00e1n borough, as the home stadiums for both America and the Pumas are within a few miles of each other.\n\n\n== Twinning ==\nCoyoac\u00e1n is a Sister City of Arlington County, Virginia, USA; it has also been a sister city of Clifden, County Galway, Ireland since 2012.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nAdolfo Aguilar Z\u00ednser\nDavid Alfaro Siqueiros\nDiana Bracho\nLuis Bu\u00f1uel\nWojciech Cejrowski\nHern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s\nPedro de Alvarado\nDolores del R\u00edo\nMiguel de la Madrid Hurtado\nMiguel \u00c1ngel de Quevedo\nLila Downs\nLaura Esquivel\nEmilio (El Indio) Fern\u00e1ndez\nAdolfo Gilly\nJorge Ibarg\u00fcengoitia\nFrida Kahlo\nDiego Luna\nMarina (La Malinche)\nMiguel Moreno Arreola\nSalvador Novo\nZelia Nuttall\nSergio Pitol\nDiego Rivera\nCarlos Salinas de Gortari\nBenjamin Travers\nLeon Trotsky\nSoberano Jr.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe band Calexico named an instrumental track on their 2015 album Edge of the Sun \"Coyoac\u00e1n.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nNoble, John (2000).

          "One of the most unusual things in the Yucatan Peninsula are its sinkholes (cenotes) created by the collapse of limestone. There are 6,000 of these pools, Mayan's considered them sacred wells. Today, many of them are used for reppelling activies. I had a guided tour to Cenote",
          "What we learned: 1. Reserve in advance as you can only visit cenotes with a guide who first leads you on a tour of the henequen hacienda and then takes you to the change room and debarkation point for Cenote tour. Tours in English appear to be every 11/2 hours. We lucked in with",
          "This place is truly amazing. First - beautiful old hacienda is here full of history. You will get all understanding of this period of time when Mexico was colonized by Spain and the huge manufacture has started getting \"the green gold\" out of there - the threads from one of",
          "We visited this hacienda, cenote on the recommendation of our hostess from th Myan Gypsy in Progreso, we are so happy we came. They offer a 2 hour experience which includes a tour of the hacienda and its historic origins along with an amazing swimming in 2 Cenotes. Our tour",
          "We've lived in Yucatan for 12 years and today had the best cenote experience ever. Swimming among stalactities and stalagmites in a dark cenote is an other-world experience. Floating on your back looking at the cave roof 15 feet above as a flashlight beam is passed across it",
          "Very easy day trip from M\u00e9rida. We arrived at Hacienda Mucuyche at around 11:30 on weekday and spent about four hours. We enjoyed swimming in the 2 cenotes, and exploring the beautiful hacienda grounds and ruins. The \"La Tiendita\" gift shop is one of the nicests I've seen in",
          "One of the best experience in Mexico. Swimming in a cenote is breathtaking and a huge must have. It starting with a tour around the hacienda, our tourguide was funny and told the history really interesting. After, the swimming is 1-1.5 hour, he explained a lot of things about",
          "It's very beautiful hacienda, especially main cave at the end, very large and beautiful to just flow and look at the top, like you're in another world. That's really awesome. It's quite expensive but you won't feel bad for paying, it's worth to visit, if not required skip the",
          "Swimming in a cenote has been on my bucket list for years. The husband and I just got off of a cruise where I finally had my chance. Our ship pulled into Progresso and I had signed us up for the Mayapan Ruins and Mucuych\u00e9 swim. The swim was breathtaking. I expected the water to",
          "Everyone is on a guided tour only because they run hundreds of people through the place every day. There were 6 huge tour buses (the ones that hold 50+ people) in the lot when I arrived. The cenotes were more crowded than a water park during a heat wave, the food was just ok and",
          "The cenotes are incredible, worth the price of admission. One swims through 3 different ones, each one better than the last. Our guide was terrific and made the first part of trip on land interesting and brief Include this on your trip to M\u00e9rida",
          "I had heard about this cenote many times from my hotel guests ... All said it was expensive but worth it . I decided to check it our for myself Yes it is expensive but well worth it The cenotes are beautiful",
          "Exceeded our expectations. We spent about 45mins with a tour of the hacienda and just over an hour in the cenotes. Perfect day trip from M\u00e9rida.",
          "This is a most enjoyable day trip outside the city of Merida! You must sign up ahead of time for a tour date and time and arrive about 30 minutes before your tour. At the entrance, you will be heartily welcomed at the reception area and receive a paper bracelet to wear for the",
          "if you are looking for an exceptional guide and transport provider - polo is your man. he will not only exceed your expectations, he will enhance your travel experience. i had the pleasure of his company for 3days in Merida - for my and my family and i would heartily recommend",
          "Loved it!!!!! Beautiful! Delicious Yucatan cuisine was served! Loved it!!!!! Beautiful! Everyone needs to experience this place!",
          "Our first interaction with the staff at the front gate was a very rude \u201cyour tour is at 1pm if you are any later we will leave without you, so be on time. We got to the meeting point at 12:50pm and waited around until 1:10pm with still no guide. We went back to the front desk",
          "This site is kept for its historical value. It hosts some settings with furniture from the local time, old machinery and barns... you can walk around, it is quite huge,... nice if you are in the area, but nit to come only for this",
          "After hearing about a friend\u2019s recommendation, we decided to visit with a friend who was visiting in town with us. What a treat!!!! By far the best cenote we have visited here in the Yucatan. Very well organized and loved our guide. Absolutely stunning and",
          "The Cenote is on an old Hacienda which is being rebuilt. The grounds are beautiful with flowers and walks. I found the whole experience amazing. Personally, I would not use the tubes. Just use the life vests. I also would invest in some type of waterproof camera with a strap to",
          "Do not miss doing this tour. Absolutely the most memorable cenote experience I\u2019ve ever had. Make sure that you use Anoop as your tour guide. He\u2019s knowledgeable, patient and makes sure that everyone has an enjoyable experience!",
          "A one hour drive from Merida to Mucuyche, and a whole other world. It was worth it! What a magical place. The remnants of the hacienda tour was wonderful and then the two cenotes on the property were amazing! Anook the guide led us through the maze of water and explained in",
          "I had seen some pics of this place and knew I absolutely needed to go there. I was not disappointed. We were met by our guide Anu ( sorry if I spelled it wrong) when we arrived and got a very informative tour and explanation of the grounds and how the hacienda worked when it was",
          "This magnificent Hacienda with its gorgeous cenotes was a wonderful way to share the beauty of the Yucatan with our friends! We had a wonderful l tour with our guide Anoop. His knowledge of the history of the Hacienda and the world it represents was excellent. His care of us as",
          "I love the Yucatan and visit quite frequently with my wife. On this occasion we brought another couple with us so they could see what all my blathering about Merida and the Yucatan were all about. This brought pressure to make sure they had a great experience and that they",
          "This Hacienda has not been restored and is a great example how they have been abandoned after industrial revolution invented Nylon and the Heneken - Sisal market, the green gold market totally collapsed. There is a small Cenote in the back. Looving these old Haciendas !",
          "By far, the best cenote you can visit, really clean, beautiful, natural. The guide was very friendly, really interesting talk about the place. It could be a little expensive but really worth it. Finish the trip swimming in the pool with a very cool view!",
          "I recently visited Hacienda Mucuych\u00e9 and it\u2019s cenotes. Both are breathtaking. Currently the hacienda is in its original state and you can tour the space. They expect to have it operational with restaurant and hotel in the near future. However, the cenotes located within this",
          "The two cenotes were amazing, especially the green corridor connecting them. The second underground cenote was one of the best we visited in the Yucatan. The experience is diminished somewhat by the sheer number of people. I guess it gets a lot of cruise ship groups. You feel",
          "The water is crystal clear and you can see 60 feet to the bottom. They recently installed lights underwater that make it possible to see to the bottom. We went on a quiet day with very few customers. Not sure what it would be like on a busy day. This experience is worth the",
          "A must experience! Beautiful clear water! Refreshing after a long morning at Mayapan. The cave, cenote, and lazy river were breathtaking. I wish I would have arranged to spend more time here.",
          "Beautiful, a must do. quite different from most other cenotes. Can't miss if you are in the area... For all ages",
          "The cheapest and at the same time the best cenote I\u2019ve been to (and I\u2019ve been to moge than 10). If you arrive before noon you will probably be alone there. Highly recommended!",
          "Two hours for exploring Mucuych\u00e9 are maybe not enough mainly because one would like to stay floating around in the cenotes. For tourists coming to Yucat\u00e1n I recommend this hacienda and cenote tour... which soon will have a few rooms to enjoy the site. It is important to make a",
          "You can't take photos deep inside this cenote, so I was completely blown away by the last part of the swim. The guide was fantastic, and helped me understand what I was seeing! Stalactites and stalagmites that are massive in a cathedral-like ocean of clear blue water. The mask",
          "Just an hour's drive from Merida, Yucatan is Mexico's truly best kept secret for visiting cenotes. Reservations are a must and getting there is a bit tricky, so trust your GPS mapping. The staff are friendly and you must go with a guide. First you tour the hacienda grounds to",
          "Did this as a part of a cruise ship excursion. It was a lot of fun. Very unique place that they are doing a lot of work on to get even a bigger bite out the tourism industry in Mexico. Can't wait to see this place in a couple of years with all the projects they are working on.",
          "Amazing experience, the Cenotes are beautiful, crystal clear water. The hacienda worth a visit but definitely the Cenotes are spectacular",
          "My family and I took a detour from Merida to Chichen-Itza to visit and it was incredible. The ruins were dope, but the cenote and the swimming, amazing! So clean and gorgeous. And the staff was amazing! We had Cesar as our guide and he made it a lot of fun! I forgot my ID when I",
          "Hubby and I just got back from Cenotes Hacienda Mucuyche and I am so excited to tell you all about it!! This cenote is approximately 1 hour away from Merida by car. We did have to travel down some little one-lane roads, but it was not bad as most of the roads are fairly new.",
          "Hacienda Tour: The tour was conducted by a very knowledgeable your lady who spoke perfect English. So no fears for those who don\u2019t speak English. You can actually messenger them on their fb page. You let them know how many are in your party and what time to expect you. It is"

          "This place was amazing.  We swam in the Cenotes and it is an experience I will never forget.  The food at the restaurant was excellent.  Definitely check out the ruins of the old hacienda.  We hope to return again someday and see more cenotes and ruins in this area.",

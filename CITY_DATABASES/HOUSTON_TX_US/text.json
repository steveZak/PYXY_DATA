        "wiki": "Space Center Houston is a leading science and space learning center, the official visitor center of NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston and a Smithsonian Affiliate museum. The organization is owned and operated by the nonprofit Manned Spaceflight Education Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization. The Johnson Space Center is the home of Mission Control and astronaut training.The center opened in 1992 and hosts more than 1 million visitors annually in its 250,000-square-foot educational complex. It is one of the top destinations in Houston holding the TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence. The center holds over 400 space artifacts, permanent and traveling exhibits, attractions, live shows and theaters dedicated to preserving the history of America's human spaceflight program. It has a number of significant artifact galleries.\nThe center has extensive STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education programs for all ages and draws more than 200,000 students and teachers each year. It annually generates a $73 million economic impact, 925 jobs and $36 million in personal income in greater Houston, according to a 2016 economic study by Jason Murasko and Stephen Cotten, associate professors of economics at the University of Houston\u2013Clear Lake.\n\n\n== Starship gallery ==\nThis artifact gallery tells the story of American spaceflight and includes three flown spacecraft, Moon rocks and a full-scale Skylab Trainer:\nMercury 9 capsule (Faith 7) flown by Gordon Cooper in 1963\nGemini 5 capsule flown by Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad in 1965\nApollo 17 Command Module America flown by Gene Cernan, Ronald Evans, and Dr. Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt, along with a biological contingent of five mice, orbited the Moon a record 75 times in 1971 during the last crewed Moon mission\nLunar Module test vehicle LTA-8\nLunar Roving Vehicle Trainer\nLunar Samples Vault\nLunar touchstone, one of only eight Moon rocks in the world that can be touched\nSkylab 1-G Trainer\nApollo-Soyuz Test Project docking module trainerThese artifacts (except Skylab) were formerly housed in Johnson Space Center's former Visitor Center in Building 2.\n\n\n== Independence Plaza ==\n\nSpace Center Houston is the home of the one-of-a-kind Independence Plaza exhibit complex. This landmark attraction contains the world's only Space Shuttle replica, where it stands mounted on one of the two original shuttle carrier aircraft. Independence Plaza is the only place where the public can enter both vehicles. The Space Shuttle replica Independence, formerly known as Explorer, previously was located at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex but was moved to make way for a new permanent attraction hall for Space Shuttle Atlantis. Independence is now displayed atop the retired Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, NASA 905. On August 14, 2014, a heavy lift called The Rise of Independence was completed to place Independence on top of NASA 905. The plane was transported to Space Center Houston from Ellington Airport on April 30, 2014. The center opened the giant exhibit complex on January 23, 2016 at an estimated cost of US$15 million. The giant complex is the biggest project for Space Center Houston since opening in 1992.\n\n\n== NASA tram tour and Rocket Park ==\nThe general public can visit Johnson Space Center only via Space Center Houston's open-air tram tour. The tour includes Building 30 (location of the Historic Mission Operations Control Room 2 and the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center), Building 9 (location of the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility) and Rocket Park with a restored Saturn V rocket. The tram tour visits working government facilities which are subject to availability and can temporarily close to visitors without notice.:38-44The first stage of this Saturn V rocket is from SA-514 (originally intended for the cancelled Apollo 19), the second stage from SA-515 (originally intended for the cancelled Apollo 20), and the third stage from SA-513, which was not needed after it was replaced by the Skylab workshop.  SA-513 was originally scheduled for the cancelled Apollo 18 - the rest of the rocket was used for Skylab). The Apollo Command/Service Module CSM-115a (intended for Apollo 19) caps the pointy end. NASA displayed the restored Saturn V, on loan from the Smithsonian, outside from 1977 through 2004, when the Smithsonian took ownership. Grants from the National Park Service's Save America's Treasures program, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and private contributors funded the restoration.\n\n\n== Mission Mars ==\nThe exhibit Mission Mars opened in January 2017 and was developed with the help of NASA. It focuses on the work NASA is doing now to plan for future travel to Mars. Mission Mars teaches visitors about the planet through a variety of activities that transport them to the Martian landscape, including a virtual reality wall, real-time weather forecasts and a Mars meteorite that guests can touch. Visitors also can see a full-size Orion linkresearch capsule, experience an Orion spacecraft simulator and get a look at the next generation of Mars rovers.\n\n\n== Other attractions ==\n\nSpace Center Theater is a five-story tall 4K resolution theater that shows EVA 23 and Mission Control: The Unsung Heroes of Apollo.\nThe lectern that President John F. Kennedy used during his 1962 Rice University Stadium speech reiterating his goal to land an American on the Moon in the 1960s, is exhibited inside Destiny Theater.\nThe ultimate VIP tour is called the Level 9 Tour and is offered at an additional cost. It lasts approximately five hours and has a driver and personal guide to visit all of the above buildings and other areas such as the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility and International Space Station museum.\nDestiny Theater has a HD digital screen and shows a short historical film, Human Destiny, produced by Bob Rogers and BRC Imagination Arts.\nThe live interactive performance Living in Space, produced by Bob Rogers and BRC Imagination Arts, employs high-tech projection mapping technology to assist with the live onstage educational presentation of daily life on the International Space Station.\nA Stellar Science Show is a live program that lets guests become rocket scientists through interactive experiments performed by a center Crew Member.\nMission Briefing Center features live presentations offering real-time updates on current NASA missions.\nThe center offers an opportunity to have \"Lunch with an Astronaut\" for an extra cost.\nAstronaut Gallery showcases a comprehensive collection of spacesuits, including Pete Conrad's Apollo 12 moonwalk suit.\nInternational Space Station Gallery provides a look inside the space station \u2013 from interactive live shows to a Robonaut and actual flown space station artifacts.\nTalon Park has a pair of NASA T-38 Talon jets greeting visitors at the street entrance to the Space Center Houston campus.\nThe original shuttlecraft Galileo prop from Star Trek: The Original Series was unveiled July 31, 2013, and displayed at the Zero-G Diner.  As of October 2019, the shuttlecraft is no longer on display.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Manned Space Flight Education Foundation's education department at Space Center Houston is among the nation's leading science-education resources. The programs are based on national science standards and focus on interactive science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) activities to inspire learning, and develop problem-solving and critical-thinking skills for all ages, especially as related to human spaceflight and exploration. Programs include:\n\nSpace Center U \u2013 The ultimate educational experience at the center\nDay camps\nStars & STEM\nField trips\nScout Camp-Ins\nGirls STEM Academy\nOvernight experiences\nSpace Exploration Educators Conference\nDistance learning\nTeam building for corporations\nHome School Days\nSensory Friendly Evenings\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSpace Center Houston Official Site\nJohnson Space Center Official Site",

          "My wife and I spent the entire day there and did not get a chance to see everything. I highly recommend an early start to your day. The entire space center was amazing to see. History does come to life (my wife and I were in grammar school when the space race was occurring).",
          "As a huge fan of anything space related, particularly the early Mercury-Apollo missions l, this was a superb visit and I wished I\u2019d had longer The first thing to do is get on the tram which takes you on a tour of mission control, the training facility and the Saturn V rocket.",
          "To get to the Space Center we had to use public transport from downtown Houston. Despite the Space Center being a main attraction there is a very infrequent bus service to the location, however this must be because demand is low as the bus wasn't actually that full. We got the",
          "We went inside the mission control area which was dark and quiet. I was sitting in the front with several family members and a sleeping toddler on my lap. A woman with a microphone came and stood right in front of me and yelled at all of us in a very mean voice about how we",
          "We took the VIP tour. It was great. We arrived 1 hour before an went in as soon as they opened. We went through the turnstiles and to the right. This is where we picked up our badges. Then we went exploring until our tour. We saw the plane and the shuttle. you can go into",
          "OK, sorry about the cheesy title, but \"Houston, we have a problem\" was too obvious. This is a fun place to spend a few hours. Liked seeing the exhibits and the giant rocket was really cool. The place was full of kids the day we were there, but I guess that's the audience a",
          "The facility shows great insight into the quest of man to search outer space and the trials and tribulations which go into it. Enjoyed the visit very much.",
          "Was quite excited to visit NASA & see around everything. The area is so big & so many interesting things to see & gathered so much information.",
          "Very interesting. Get to see original command center, rockets, etc. Exhibit in gallery interesting. Take shuttle tours right away to make sure you get on",
          "My granddaughter\u2019s first trip to NASA during spring break. My granddaughter really enjoyed the ride available.For two people to write these three rides it will set you back about $75-$80 dollars. I enjoyed the talk by the astronaut who flew around the world in 90 minutes. He",
          "My kids, my wife and I all liked the day spent from the opening to the close. A must if you like space or NASA history",
          "My son, his girlfriend, and I signed up for the VIP tour online based on what we read about it. I expected to be in a group of 10 or so, but it ended up just being the 3 of us! What a treat to have our own private tour guide show us so much stuff that the general public doesn't",
          "without a doubt if this is the place to get knowledge of the space. You will have to bring the family and you will have a very pleasant time, but above all you will acquire a lot of knowledge.",
          "Must do while you\u2019re in Houston! My family and I really had a blast and it was really awesome to be able to see walk thru the shuttles and do the different hands on activities.",
          "If you remember the great early days Of the space conquest this tour will bring you joy. You feel the greatness of those days. Absolutely authentic.",
          "We booked the Level 9 tour some months ahead on advice from friends. We arrived early and had to hang around for 20 minutes , but there are things to see outside . Once inside , and booked in , we took some time viewing the exhibits in the halls , and were very glad we did",
          "We purchased the city pass next on the list NASA. Would strongly recommend you arrive when it opens . So much to do and you want to have time to be able to get the full experience. We actually ran out of time . There are two tours you can do but be prepared to stand and wait .",
          "This was a great place to explore, learn and have fun! We enjoyed touring the buildings and training area and exploring the main areas. It was fun to be able to interact with everything inside. My only complaint was their line organization for tours. You wait in one line to",
          "It is a learning adventure for adults and children alike. The robotics and building of things used in space exploration are so fascinating. I had not been for many years but truly enjoyed the visit once again. It is something that should be on the top of your list when",
          "...we have NO problem. ISS, Space Shuttle, Saturn 5 - it's all there to bee seen and explored. My favorite is the historic tripe to Mission Control for Apollo 11, 13... Being present on TV for 50+ years, it's seeing Mission Control coming alive again is the Ultimate Experience!",
          "Beautiful collection of Human achievement over space. Nice explanations especially the real time landing on moon. worth to visit this place.",
          "This is a great place to learn about space. It\u2019s great for families and friends and a lot of things for kids to do.",
          "Is a wounderful place to visit and learn. The bus tour was an exciting adventure along with alot of information and sites.",
          "The most exciting part of this adventure was getting to go on the tram tour, which is included with a general admissions ticket. The tram tour is where you get to see some things in action or things that will be in action. The actual museum itself I would call underwhelming. I'm",
          "Did the level 9 tour in late Feb 2020. It was an excellent experience! There were 2 tour groups on our day and both guides seemed very knowledgeable. The earlier tour was led by Dave C who had a wealth of information based on his employment with NASA. He even wrote a book about",
          "Informative, entertaining, fun for age 8+. Convenient ticketing, tram tours, accurate information. Some of the guides speak very quickly and would do well to practice their delivery. Good food choices.",
          "The new mission Mars control center is unbelievable. Education in every aspects. Science atmosphere is be on expectations. If you are visiting Houaton you must go to NASA.",
          "I totally enjoyed the visit, it did pretty much everything, but you gotta get there early, i got there around 10h30 and we've been pushed out at closing time. I went outside the high season, so not as crowded as i was expecting, but still had to do lineup for the tram tour.",
          "I came to nasa back in the early 80's, and than again now in my 70's, and what a difference 40 years makes. Wasn't much to see in the 80's, but now you can spend a entire day there, and maybe not do and see everything. Great place to bring the young and old alike.",

          "Went with our kids (5, 3, 1.5) and they all had a blast. Sure, some of the museum was over their heads, but they did have a section geared for younger kids, and there was tons of hands-on exhibits in the bulk of the museum. Our favorite part by far though was the tour of the",
          "Went here for a day trip. When we arrived we went through the ticket booth and turnstiles. It wasn\u2019t busy when we went (12.30pm) and we got through straight away. Having read reviews on here prior we thought it would be best to do the tram tour first. The line wasn\u2019t really that",
          "We had an afternoon here and loved it. Highlight was the tour to see mission control that was responsible for the Apollo missions. The other exhibits were also good. So much to see!",
          "Visited with out of town friends. Truly well planned and executed center. Interesting exhibits, some interactive, educational programs, great movies. Tram tours to Saturn rocket, Mission Control (highly recommended), Orion control and astronaut training center. Also",
          "I'm giving the Space Center tours 5 stars and the Space Center museum 2. Unless you have little kids, the museum/ride/activities are absolutely nothing to write home about. The \"museum\" exhibits are wayyyy outdated in comparison to other facilities. But hey, what's a place to",
          "Living in Houston, we decided to visit NASA for the day. The activities to do there are very limited and many of the \u201cattractions\u201d were not working due to malfunctioning. The Tram experience recommended in other posts was also far from great. I will never recommend it to",
          "Typical Space Center Exhibits. A little disappointed in the visit compared to other space centers we have toured. It was during the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s, so this is NOT the time to go unless you want to not see things and wait in lines. The hour-long lines",
          "This was amazing, so much information. It does take about 4 hours minimum - plan for longer. The guides were great.",
          "We got there before they opened, ticket booth opened 15 minutes early. We talked to the staff and learned about special tickets (no cost) to see the rebuilt Apollo Command Center. Enter the building go to the kiosk on the right. We got the first tram at 10:30 and some were",
          "Amazing tour of the original mission control, be prepared to spend a whole day in the museum if you want to visit all tours, Highly recommend the 3 tram tours around the site and the astronauts talk",
          "We had a great day at Space Center Houston. Just be certain you go to Space Center Houston, not the Johnson Space Center :-) We spent nearly an entire day at the Space Center and enjoyed everything about the exhibits. We particularly enjoyed the two tram tours - one to the",
          "My wife and I arrived a few minutes after a Sunday morning opening. We were guided to the location for Apollo 11 Tram tickets, did that nostalgic trip and the Tram to the International Space Station Training Facility with no waiting. We spent a bit over 5 hours and were VERY",
          "We understand that the actual quote was \"okay, Houston, we've had a problem here\" but in any event, we enjoyed taking the tram tour from Space Center Houston to the Johnson Space Center to see the historic Mission Control room for the Gemini and Apollo missions. We were in",
          "Kind of expensive, but worth the visit. We took a group of high school athletes and they loved it. They learned something while out playing a tournament.",
          "It has been some ten years since I last visited this attraction, and it's fair to say a lot has changed since then. There are still the same old familiar exhibits, with a few spectacular new ones. Most impressive of all has to be the converted Boeing 747 shuttle transporter",
          "As part of a bus tour, we had ample time to explore the entire center at our leisure. There were several very informative films shown that you can pop into. It is for all ages, easy walking, a good food court, and bathrooms. Larger and small gift shops. You would definitely want",
          "We had a lot of fun here on a gloomy day cold day. There was lots of stuff to do and see. The bathroom was clean too!!",
          "I went to this place my last vacation and saw many interesting things like spaceships and some fake UFOs that adorned a stage that represented space and the moon",
          "Make sure to go to the Independence plane(s). That was incredible to see the actual plane and insides. Wow! Lots of great information, exhibits and interactive things for everyone to do. Probably spent about 2 hours, but we didnt take the bus out to the sites. We ran out of",
          "This place was AMAZING!! There is so much to do and see. My advice would be to go on the tram rides first as they get packed quickly to explore rocket park which is unbelievable.",
          "A total cluster. Complete, unorganized mess, not even a site map to try to get to things you're interested in. Plan on spending half your day standing in line, often in one you don't want to be in. Also, plan on a full day of kids treating the entire place like a playground",
          "We had a lot of fun with our pals from California visiting. they enjoyed the Crawfish and Jambalaya.",
          "We were in Kennedy Space Center few years ago and had a great time, so we really looked forward to get here. Main building was a disappointment, \"restaurant\" serving expensive sub par fast food, gift shop so crowded and under staffed, that it was impossible to buy anything.",
          "Waste of money and time. Everything is under repair, poor lighting, dangerous for wheelchairs. Packed with unsupervised kids from 5-18, all bored.",
          "Extremely interesting and entertaining experience. Great displays. Knowledgeable tour guides, interactive displays. Very friendly and helpful staff. We purchased a Family pass to return with our Grandchildren!",
          "We booked a \"Lunch with the Astronaut\" in advance and the meal was better than I expected and practically everyone had a chance to ask a question. There were other astronaut speakings. The tram tour took us back to the original launch center with a whole recreation of the July",
          "Great spot for a couple of hours' touring, but no need to make a full day of it. Continuing on to see Galveston is worth doing.",
          "Big complex with a lot of things to do. A lot of activities for kids. Perfect place for the whole family. Make sure you have enough time because some of the activities are pretty busy and you might have to wait a couple of hours. You will not be bored while waiting but you need",
          "Nice venue, great spacecraft! Good tour. Very nice to observe and experience the Spacecraft used by NASA.",
          "This is one of the few MUST of Houston! We spent three hours there but were not enough! There are interactive games, pieces of moon to touch and see, aircrafts and tram tours! During the tour got to see the control room which was the most amazing experience! Loved it and would",
          "Spent 5 terrific hours at the Center today and enjoyed every minute. Did not get to see everything, but everything I saw was great. Tram tour to mission control is a must do. Did not have time for the other 2 tours. Restaurant has good selection of food although a bit pricy.",
          "It has been a fantastic adventure. I love this museum and for each lover it is the temple of space exploration.",
          "Here is my recommendation to maximising your visit. We happened to visit on a fairly slow day, but even so, there was some grumbling. It is all about the logistics. Despite what the website suggests, there are three tram tours, not two. I suggest getting there around",
          "Cool center with things to do and see. Took the shuttle to the control center, and could experience the launch of the Apollo 11. Not a big place, so half a day is a lot of time to see all.",
          "This was a very unplanned visit, but due to issues at Houston airport we missed our connecting flight and decided to see what we could before the next flight which was a 24hours away. It was a great experience and wasn\u2019t too busy - was easy to get too, we got a Uber. A place",
          "We really enjoyed our time here. It was so well done. It is a great educational experience. We will have to bring our grandkids next time.",
          "Outstanding, and completely worth the price. We literally spent about 6 hours on this tour with an excellent tour guide - David Elmer. We saw rockets, landers, learned about past, current and future space missions, spoke at length with a flight director (super personable",
          "Wonderful, comfortable tour of Houston with a driver who truely loves his city. The Space Center was fascinating. With travel and entry fees provided the cost was very reasonable.",
          "You will need at least 3 hours to tour the Space Center Houston. My husband and I were so glad that we made time for the experience. There is so much to see there, you'll want to check in at the guest center for recommendations of where to start. Friendly and fun staff are there",
          "Enjoyed our day at the Space Museum. Thought it would be an infinite rehash of \u201cHouston, we have a problem\u201d, but it was so much more than that. The guides (I believe were volunteers) were very good at answering my son\u2019s difficult questions. Why do they modify the fuel mix for",
          "Not friendly. Not helpful. We waited for a tram to see mission control because there was no other choice when scheduling our time slot. Found out after there was another tram to see inside the space craft. Mission control was interesting but would have liked to see the space",
          "Great place to visit, really interesting and plenty to check out. Really enjoyed the tram ride which took about an hour to tour the premises and give a larger insight to the work that takes place at NASA.",
          "It is really interesting to see all the technology involved on spaceships. But this place disappointed me: old stuff, old graphics, old movies. I'm sure the NASA can hire museums experts to improve!",
          "This is a total must visit. If you see nothing else in Houston, the Space Center is a must. They have one of the rockets of the type that took men to the Moon and capsules that men came back in. You just gasp to think that men went in that tiny capsule on that enormous rocket,",
          "Visiting the Space Center Houston is one of those larger than life events in one's life, especially for those of us old enough to have seen it all live as it happened, back when we had a space program. I highly recommend it.",
          "Earlier this week, my husband and I were fortunate to take a Level 9 Tour of the Space Center. Our guide, David, grew up in the area when it was farm land and shared an interesting perspective about the growth of the space center. His enthusiasm for the space program and the",
          "You should not miss visiting this awesome place if you are in Houston. It has everything for everyone, whether kids or adults, all will enjoy equally. Make sure you arrive at the facility by 9:50 AM in winters and 9 AM in summers as it gets too busy. Next best thing to do is buy",
          "I was anticipating 2 hr queues and thousands of people but we virtually had the place to ourselves, got there at opening and left at closing, we had 3 kids with us and we saw everything. Lots to read and do but I wouldn\u2019t imagine it would be fun if you were jostling with",
          "Generally I am not one to write unfavorable reviews, however this \u201cmuseum\u201d lacked so much. My family and I are admirers of all things space and science related but the exhibits were not very innovative, most in fact that were interactive were down for repairs. The tram ride had",
          "We went to visit because, well how can you go to Houston and not visit the Space Center. Us adults really enjoyed all the history of space exploration and the artifacts/models/film, especially since so much of this happened in our lifetime.... my kids enjoyed it a bit, but then",
          "Great place to visit. Allow a full day. Take the bus tour first as it get full in the afternoon. Be sure to see the Sat V rocket.",
          "Plan a full day to experience all this wonderful attraction has to offer. The list of wonders to be seen and experienced here is extensive. From a genuine, flight-capable Saturn V rocket to crew training mock-ups of every space module currently in use in space, you will be",
          "For the price, this place has tones to do! There are plenty of interactive exhibits and cool artifacts. You get to touch a piece of Mars, tour a 747 aircraft, tour a space ship, see real rockets, go on a trolly tour and see where engineers are working hard to develop new",
          "I had an interesting visit to the Houston space centre. Just after the entrance a lot of interactive stations Mission control and training centre provides a good insight how it was and how it will be in space. The Saturn v rocket and the space shuttle on the transportation",
          "We read reviews before going and were glad to have tips to arrive early (9:30 was good and there are outside bathrooms). We got our tickets to enter, realized before it was too late that there was a line forming to get in. Went straight to get the timed tram to Mission",
          "The films and videos were great. It was wonderful to go through the shuttle in Independence Plaza. The trams are great but there are issues. One tram to the Control Center needs a timed ticket. The other two - Astronaut Training and Orion trams are wait in line. Each tram",
          "We lived in DC for more than 20 years and have seen the Smithsonian and Udvar museums and they are really very cool and free. The Houston space center charges a fees and yet it is a different experience with the Space shuttle exhibit and the very unique command center",
          "We arrived at 10am and stayed until it closed at 5pm. We did two tram tours, three talks, saw exhibits galore and bought an astronaut-signed book in the shop. We had an amazing day, and loved every minute. Our top tip is to go early and do a tour (or tours) early. There were no",
          "Four hours almost covered it. So interesting! The tram ride is the main event. The commentary was a bit annoying as instructions were repeated ad-nauseum but you learn to stop listening. The presentation in the Mission Control Room however, that was brilliant! We viewed the",
          "I went to Air/Space museum in DC many times, one in Virginia, and has been around other similar stuff, so I didn't expect much from this. But i loved it! i think they did wonderful job organizing it so it looks interesting. We were there on Tue, so there were no crowds, so maybe",
          "Nothing special during NASA\u2019s visit. The tram tour lasts around 70\u2019 and goes through some facilities that resembles a \u201cpropaganda city \u201d or Hollywood. The Gemini building is a little interesting as you can see the rocket itself lying there and some interesting stories of the",
          "I lost $200. The lines were so long you wait in multiple lines to see anything and we spent about 3 hours in line for 1 hour of viewing and didn\u2019t get to see the main attraction. Don\u2019t loose your money.",
          "Went on Sunday with out of town guests and was sorely disappointed. Don't waste your money, especially $29 per adult and $25 per kid.",
          "The Space Center is a great day out for all ages. You can spend a couple of hours or a full day if you do all things available. Well worth a visit given the history.",
          "We planned on visiting the space centre before heading to Galveston to pick up a cruise. We arrived about 30 minutes prior to opening time and bought tickets without any issues. USD30 per adult. It was a bitterly cold day with the wind blowing. We sat in our car waiting for",
          "I was so disappointed at how touristy this was. The darkness made it difficult for me to maneuver the main floor. A lot of the exhibits didn't work. Plan NOT to buy food or drink there. It's very pricey. We really enjoyed the two tram tours and the shuttle. We won't return.",
          "We are frequent visitor to the Space Center, living in Houston we are members meaning we can visit the place as many times as we want in a period of 12 months (we highly recommend it). And every time we go we find exciting things. The Galaxy of lights was one of the most",
          "While we enjoyed our visit to the space center, it was difficult to get helpful information from the staff. They are clearly young and nice but additional training is needed. Rather than say \u201cI am not sure\u201d they gave incorrect or incomplete information about locations of",
          "The group we were with had a great time and learned alot. Took the tram ride to the control station, that's a must. Alot to do in one day. Need some new trams one was too loud and speakers were bad. Neat experience though.",
          "As an avid space geek when I was growing up in the 60s, I was very excited about visiting Johnson Space Centre and getting under the skin of the space race. However, it didn\u2019t quite work like that but it wasn\u2019t a disaster by any stretch of the imagination. My family and I",
          "What a fun and amazing place to visit. The last few years they have really made an effort to make it a first class attraction, none other like it. Highly recommended and a short drive south from downtown, while you in Clear Lake also visit The Kemah Boardwalk for more and many",
          "Took my six-year-old grandson to the Space Center for a tour, for Galaxy Lights, and the next day, for Lunch with an astronaut. We had a wonderful time. The tours and hands on activities were age appropriate and interesting. He made a flashlight, and lunar lander. Lunch with the",
          "There were a lot of space items to see and read about their contribution to space flights. Wear comfortable shoes!",
          "I enjoyed the space center and the two tours. Great place to spend 3+ hours. Best to go during the week day, with less crowds. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Houston",
          "Arrive early. So much to see and do!! More than 1 days worth. Ride the 90 minute Tram Tour first thing when you arrive. Get tickets for Control Tour before getting on the Tram Tour! Allow 2 hours for Tram Tour before going on Control Room Tour. Must Do's - Tram Tour, Control",
          "We (2 senior adults with no children along) recently visited here and enjoyed our visit. We were fortunate to go on a day with light crowds, close parking available, and no wait for the tram tour to the Saturn V building and the Astronaut Training Center. Our tram guide (Reed)",
          "I toured the SC--Houston in late December 2019. It was very very crowded (with visitors like myself) but the experience for both myself and my 28 year-old son was great and inspiring We had to stand in lines for the Space Shuttle tour up the elevated stairways under the parked",
          "On our visit the site was quite quiet so we didn't experience any problems parking or any queues for the entrance or tram tour. The exhibition centre itself is large, with a lot of different exhibits, many of which are interactive. It would certainly be possible to spend a lot",
          "Enjoyed our visit. So glad it was not busy mid week in January. Nice sunny day for tram tours. Took both tours. Arrived at opening and got a timed ticket to mission control tour, which lasted about an hour. That was really amazing. Could have spent more time just gazing at the",
          "Consider getting an individual or family membership; the extra cost more than pays for itself if you go for 2 days (includes free parking). The whole shebang really requires 2 days (or one very long day). Please, this is not for small children. They have a kid's area, but why",
          "Maybe it was just bad timing? Large crowds of rude adults and children. Couldn't watch or hear the short video because of loud0 talking by adults and kids. Tram tour line was way too long with standard admission ticket so we paid extra to upgrade. Tour had same problems of",
          "Unlike the Kennedy Space Center, this is not actually part of NASA, it is a separate educational organization. They have an included tram that takes visitors onto the NASA property. Only a few of the trams take visitors to mission control and you need a ticket (free). We",
          "Expected more from this place to be honest. It's only really one large area with different aspects of space. Very informative and good for kids, but at $30 entry ( and not much less for kids), I was bored within an hour. If you're thinking of doing the bus/tram tour, be aware",
          "We traveled from Iowa with a 8, 5, and 4 year old to visit family in Houston and new we needed to take our space loving kids to the Space Center. Full disclaimer, our visit was 2 days after Christmas so we knew big crowds and a bit of chaos was to be expected. Getting tickets to",
          "Went to visit over the holidays with our adult son and his fiance. Hadn't been there in years. Had a great time. Space Center Houston offers a totally immersive experience. The exhibits and video experiences are very well done, entertaining and informative. We took the Mission",
          "Firstly this is the most amazing and inspiring place where the magnitude of the endeavours of individuals and the huge teams that make space exploration possible are displayed and demonstrated in multiple ways with pride and actually made me feel quite emotional at times even",
          "Hadn't been there in 20 years, decided to take the grand kids and WOW has it changed. All sorts of tours and educational venues that will take up your day with fun. Go early though as school groups arrive and slow things down.",
          "It's a must visit place for everyone who wants to know more about the space and with science interests. It is one of Houston's top attractions.",
          "What an experience we had today! I can\u2019t speak highly enough for the \u201cLevel 9\u201d tour which was a small group limited to 12 people and really took us into the depths of the Center that are not available to the general public with transportation in a very comfortable",
          "Everyone needs to see the Space Center Houston. The exhibits are fantastic and the videos captivating. If you want to know where the space program has been and where it is going next, you can find out at the Space Center. I noticed some reviewers complained about long lines",
          "The NASA visitor center has some nice exhibits, including a full size shuttle mock up on a real 747 transport aircraft but the real start here is the tram tour that takes you on to Johnson Space Center and into the original iconic mission control. Restored to its Apollo glory",
          "BIG disappointment. We went here mainly to see Mission Control. There was NO signage (that we saw) at the ticket booth stating that in addition to buying your entry ticket (which gives you access to the tram tour) that you ALSO had to go to a kiosk and get an additional free",
          "This place has been on my bucket list forever and now I finally had the chance to visit. You have to go right when it opens up at 10am or there is a huge line waiting for you. Also you have to get into the line for the tram tours, since they only have limited capacity and are",
          "The Space Center is a great place to learn about the history of our space program. It was great to see the Mission Control room that we saw so may times on TV in the past. The facility has great exhibit, lots of hands on areas, plenty of space exploration history displays and",
          "This is a great family visit. We recommend getting a membership - it\u2019s the same price if a family of 5 as individual tickets and you get to go to the front of the line (2hours long) for the tram tour \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. Lots of things to see and learn.",
          "I bought 2 tkts online for $50. We arrived at space center before 10AM, when they scan the tickets, it keeps on saying that the Tickets Has No Uses Left. Good thing I arrived before opening, and I was able to convince them that there's no way someone else could have used the",
          "We had very very long lines and ridiculous waiting times here... price is steep for what you actually get: more for small children than adults or older kids.",
          "We visited the museum on Dec. 30, which turned out to be a very crowded day, which definitely affected our enjoyment of the visit. There are two tours available, the astronaut training facility tour, and the mission control centre tour. We were hoping to do the mission control",
          "This visit was definitely a goal of life and we made it!! The inside area is full of physics, mechanics interactive exercises for all ages, and also long astronauts and space history is all around! We visited the preserved room where the dialogues between planet Earth and Neil",
          "Saturday after Christmas. You\u2019d think if you can put a man on the moon you could have simple and organized parking/traffic flow to/from museum....not the case. Inside museum was a circus. Too many people, not enough space. -no pun intended- long lines for outdoor tram tours.",
          "The exhibits were quite interesting but I felt like the tour operators need more training in customer relations. Our tram driver Celine was rude, surly and condescending. Everywhere we went it appeared the staff were yelling at people - especially towards closing time..",
          "We went on 12/30 and spent about 80% of our time standing in line. It was total chaos. Signage bad/obsolete or confusing. Average age of staff appeared to be about 16. They opened a third tour b/c of crowds that was a joke. Definitely should have limited entrance because they",
          "My wife and I went specifically to see the Saturn V rocket and space shuttle. We only had a few hours so went immediately to the shuttle transport line for the shuttle to the rocket area where the Saturn V rocket is. It was worth the two hour shuttle line wait. The Saturn V",
          "Space Center Houston has a wonderful indoor space exhibit running the gamut from Gemini/Apollo to the International Space Station plus a very cool outside exhibit of one of the space shuttles. You're able to go inside the shuttle to see things up close. You'll need to take a",
          "I had read lots of reviews before going, and knew we were visiting on one of the busiest days of the year. We prepurchased a membership, booked our Apollo Mission Control tram ahead of time, and got there early. The best decision. Walked on to almost every Tram without waiting",
          "12/30 was a horrible time to visit. You stand in line for 3-4 hours for a tram tour and only rocket park was open. Nobody informed you anything. I ended up getting a membership and visited again on 12/31. A lot better! Fewer people, almost no lines for members. Our tour guide",
          "Go early! We knew it would be busy being January 1st so we went early and were able to go on the tram tour early with no wait! Definitely got busier as the day went on! Very informative and lots to see and learn.",
          "This was a very busy weekend.... as expected it as overcrowded but as you walked in the greeters informed us how to navigate the crowd and get to see the exhibits efficiently. It worked and we enjoyed our tour. Make sure the first thing you do when you walk in a s talk to the",
          "We did the level 9 tour which took us to areas not seen on the regular team tour. This included the astronauts training area, the mission control area. It was worth the price and I would recommend just to see those areas. Our tour guide neil was incredibly knowledgable about",
          "Terribly run. If you are going to visit NASA go to Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. Don\u2019t waste your time on Houston. Even the Cosmosphere in Kansas has a better set up than Houston. Houston definitely has a problem(s): 1. Tram tour centric. But zero info on them",
          "We probably went at the wrong time, which was between Christmas and New Years, but I truly hated this visit. We arrived about an hour after it opened, and there was already a 45-minute wait for the tram tour. We didn't do it right away, and so it then turned into a 2-hour",
          "It was an interesting place to visit. My favorite exhibit was the space shuttle transport plane. The Saturn V exhibit doesn\u2019t compare to the Davidson Center Saturn V exhibit at the Huntsville AL Space and Rocket Center",
          "This is one of the worst exhibits/museums that we have ever visited. The exhibits were \"old\" and \"tired\". There was no crowd management and the main building was so packed that it was difficult to move 10 feet. Thank goodness there was no emergency as it would have been a",
          "Our family took advantage of the Level 9 Tour @ $179 each. This 4-5 hour tour includes an inside look at the Saturn V Rocket, Neutral Buoyancy Lab, Space Vehicle Mockup Facility, Mission Control, hot lunch, and so much more. The tickets also allow a return on day 2 to visit",
          "The Johnson Space Center has so much to explore for children and adults. There are interactive games and displays, video presentations, special tours to working buildings and mission control rooms, and a good food court. You can observe the space shuttle from within. A lot to",
          "We were so excited for this visit to NASA!! After visiting though, I differ a bit from what others have mentioned. Yes, see the exhibits because the hands-on stuff is great, although admission is a little pricey. However, I would skip the tram tours. Even with older children (8",
          "The scale of the major exhibits was extremely impressive and interesting, but the long lines to get on the trolleys that move people around were tiresome.",
          "Very interesting exhibits and information booths. The whole thing just does not seem to be geared to a public spoiled by sophisticated theme parks, seems a little underwhelming.",
          "Go early an plan to do a full day at the Space Center. I recommend doing all the tours, and exhibits. The IMax experience made you feel that you were in the spacelab orbitting the earth, The cafeteria was reasonably priced too.Some science background is helpful ,but necessary",
          "Love it!! Unfortunately could only spent a half day there but if visiting make sure you schedule a whole day there to see everything.",
          "The exhibits here are just fantastic and was a highlight of our trip however I feel their tours could be done so much better. It felt like the tours were half assed as such with no proper thought. They almost felt temporary and unorganized. Maybe it was going there after",
          "As huge fans of all things space and flight, we had high hopes for our day at the Space Center, especially after having a fantastic time at the Kennedy Space Center. previously But alas, the bulk of our day was spent standing in lines and trying to figure out the various tram",
          "What a great place to experience, plenty to see & do. If you can get to Houston, go there just to see the space centre. You will not regret it. You don't have to be a nerd.",
          "Maybe my review will help someone properly organize a visit to this place. This is a complex of buildings that are not interconnected. To get from one building to another, a tram service was organized between them. But these routes are organized very poorly! We spent more",
          "If you come in and see a very long line for the tram tour, do not wait in line unless you want to spend about 5 hours standing. If you want to see what is it about, I will tell you what I experienced on a very crowded day. You would get in the line indoor to get to another line",
          "This is our 5th visit to Johnson Space Center and we have seen something different every time. This time it was to see the Space Center lit up with Christmas lights and it truly was a sight to see. Well worth the visit.",
          "Bought tickets online. Got in only to find no tram tours available for the Mission Control. This after standing in line for 15 minutes. Why not put up a sign saying tours are sold out? The other regular Tram Tour had a wait time of two and a half to three hours. Seriously? Why",
          "I love space and I enjoyed my visit to the space center. But it was really poorly setup. Long lines everywhere (more than an hour). Layout of building confusing. For example we nearly missed the moon rock vault and the early space craft exhibit (where they have a real Apollo",
          "It was amazing but the lines were really long. Just getting off the road took 20 minutes and parking another 20. The line for the ride was 2 hours so we just explored the facility and decided not to spend time waiting for the tour or to climb up into the space shuttle. Go early",
          "Me and my wife and our 2 kids visited the Johnson space center on fri,dec 27 2019.we all had a blast!it took us two day 2 see everything cause we did the tram tours .it all was well worth it!",
          "To say I was disappointed in my visit to Johnson Space Center in Houston is an understatement. I have visited KSC in Florida many times often taking middle school students and I expected an equally positive experience in Houston, Nope! The management and staff team does not",
          "The only reason this got 2 stars is because it has a few cool exhibits. The lack of flow and organization is laughable when you consider it\u2019s NASA! The lines meandered through the exhibits, so you can\u2019t see half of the them, it takes longer for them to load and unload the tour",
          "The NASA Space Center Houston is an awesome experience. So much history oozes from the 60s/70s architectural buildings. The mix of history and the new age ensure a great few hours - a highlight being able to see the operational Mission Control Center in operation for the ISS.",
          "We attend December 26, 2019 from opening time to after closing. The place was packed you can barely walk. It was impossible to read lines were more then 1 hour for everything. For the tram it was 2 hours we waited through the day and never got better at 1:30 pm after lunch we",
          "We had a lot of fun, but the line was really long for the tram tour. Try to plan your trip on a not so crowded day. We went over the Christmas break. We purchased a membership so that we could go in the members line and not have to wait over 2 hours.",
          "Can't say it enough GO EARLY. Initially not impressed with the hands on stuff that didn't work and models. But worth it for the Shuttle and transport display outside. Didn't have time for the tram tour read other reviews for them. Some other time. Getting there early is",
          "The center is well designed. it's amazing to see space shuttle's inside and out, touching rock from the moon, gathering knowledge about the space and what human has done. You will be seeing a lot and enjoying your time there. Highly recommend if you are in Houston to visit the",
          "Watch a movie about space travel and you'll experience as much as we experienced without standing in a line to ride a tram to stand in line to ride a tram to wait to hear a 15 minute spiel before riding a tram to wait in a line to ride a tram. It's awful. Save yourself hours of",
          "It was a terrible experience. You will need to experience the long line to move from one place to another. They have special lines for members (so, I guess, they\u2019re encouraging their guests to buy that membership). We spent 4hrs in the line and less than 30 mins for the tour.",
          "We came shortly after Christmas on a Saturday and the crowds were horrendous. The lines for the trams were many hours long. Worst way I can think of to spend a day. They need to limit the folks that come here in a day to make it pleasant for everyone. Instead they took my money",
          "This place is way over priced! Not worth the 3 hour plus trip from Killeen, TX. The only thing worth seeing is the Saturn V rocket which is only accessible taking a boring tram tour. Also (most) of the staff is acting bored or tired. Sorry NASA you can do better than this.",
          "Really enjoyed the 4 different tram destinations...2 different command center rooms (Apollo & Orion), rocket park, & the astronaut training facility. HOWEVER, if this organization can send humans to the moon, I\u2019d think they could figure out a better system of shuffling their",
          "Galaxy Lights was beautiful! There were lights and music inside as well as a tram outside. The tram took people to Rocket Park, where we could see lighted exhibits and the Saturn V, which was stunning! S\u2019mores pits and hot cocoa also available :)",
          "The interactive exhibits, detailed information on the history and evolution of space travel, commentaries and inspiring talks by astronauts make this place a very worthwhile visit for both kids and adults!",
          "A great place to spend time with the family, there is so much to learn and see. I loved that you interact with the exhibits. Totally worth it!",
          "Space centre Houston is an amazing place for anyone who is interested in aeronautics or astronautics. It has an amazing amount of displays relating to the past, present and future space programs. As well as simulators and interactives. I would highly recommend the tram tour. You",
          "If you really want to dive in to your space experience, book a special tour! The basic tour still is good, especially the Saturn rocket. I like the diorama of the moon. Apart from that the whole thing lives from the heroic history. It\u2019s all long gone, nothing at stake of today\u2019s",
          "NASA area is exciting place to visit mini nice themed restaurants there is a McDonald's with an s theme and other restaurants the area is quite kept up nicely not much traffic great hotels nice polite people around shopping is adequate in the common area of NASA museum it's",
          "It\u2019s a great place to spend a day, You can visit the shuttle and the 747 airplane also a 45 minutes tour to visit some facilities and a complete Saturn rocket, I think this is an excelent place to visit alone, with your couple or the entire family.",
          "What an experience! Went with my parents and wife. Started with tram tours, first to mission control room and then to training mock up. Initially I was not impressed with the tours and amount of info given by guides on tram, but the whole experience just got better as we worked",
          "There was so much to see there. I liked that you could get into the capsule, and other exhibits there. You could easily spend all day there so make sure to give yourself enough time if you want to see everything.",
          "I was there with my friend just to visit and look around. What a great vision and concept of Astronauts. Those trams running is awesome and must see Saturn V for life time experience. Can't get more of it.",
          "Prior to visiting the Space Center, I was skeptical and unsure if I'd enjoy it. Well! I was so wrong. Neither of us are 'space people' but this visit gave us a great intro to NASA, the work they do and an appreciation for the lives of astronauts. The memorial drive of oak trees",
          "The Space Center was awesome to visit! The different exhibits and displays were all very interesting. Our 4 year old daughter was with us, and she also really loved the museum too. We did a tram tour to mission control, which was very interesting to see. This place is a must see",
          "HOWEVER, if you have been to Kennedy Space Center, Marshall Flight Center (or the space museum in Huntsville) you might be a tad disappointed with the amount of actual space history. The tour of the facilities seemed a little...short and other than a tram ride around the",
          "I went on a school trip and the students loved this place! We did the tram tour, watched one of the movies, saw the Saturn V, and wandered through the Space Shuttle and Museums. We went back at night for the Galaxy Nights light exhibit which was fun.",
          "Had a very enjoyable visit to the Space Center. The most notable area for improvement being the need to provide better info on the tram tours. The key point which is not clear (even after speaking to staff at the tram departure point) is that there are two different tram tours",
          "We used to visit NASA in the 70s & 80s. We went back on a recent during a recent stay in Houston. It has changed. They have a lot more impressive displays now. The main building has lots to do and see. I liked the interactive area and the history areas. We took one of the tram",
          "Having been to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, we found this a bit disappointing.It's not particularly well organised and many of the displays are mock ups. It seems to have been set up with some focus on interactive activities for kids but many of them were not functioning.",
          "Absolutely out of this world! For those of us who grew up with the Apollo missions this is fantastic. However there's something for young and old here. Don't leave Houston without a day at NASA.",
          "We became members at NASA this year. This was our second trip. We are so glad we went! We visited the day before Thanksgiving. There was hardly anyone there. I think this is so new that people don\u2019t know about it. The lights were beautiful & a fun new way to kick off the",
          "Something for every age here. Fascinating info, artifacts and replications. Touching a real moon rock thrilling but taking the free tour and sitting in the real mission control just as it was and watching the Eagle land was mind blowing. Do not miss this experience.",
          "I took my grandson to Houston for his 10th birthday, as one of his birthday requests was to go to the Space Center for his birthday. The venue is amazing for a ages. There are unique space and science exhibits, historical displays and a great food court. We spent the better part",
          "I am an avid space fan. As a retired science teacher, I\u2019ve followed NASA since the Gemini days. Normally I am an avowed promoter of anything NASA. This visit probably changed that for me. I attended the crew debrief of expedition 58/59/60 on Dec 10th. As the trip involves a 970",
          "A life time experience. Opens from 10 to 5pm. If you want to visit this place spare one whole day for this tour. Be there at 9 to get the ticket. It cost $30 per person. My advice is to have Tram tour first as when you return from there you can utilise your spare time in",
          "Tram tour is the best- the low volume of the intercom and tram engine/hitch noise made it hard to hear the guide. Food/drink are pricey in the food court!",
          "I had forgotten how small this place is (especially for the price). We visited all the exhibits and heard an astronaut speak (highlight of the day). Some of the exhibits are cool. Some need updates. One had the worst quality dummies I\u2019ve ever seen. They looked like they\u2019d been",

          "We found Galaxy Lights a very enjoyable experience. It was not overly crowded. NASA honored its STEM learning opportunities disguised as beauty and fun. We were there for 4 hours, while officially it says expect to spend two hours. We didn't want to rush, and we did some",
          "Did this on leaving our cruise trip arriving in Galveston, en route for a night in Houston. This meant we had a lot of luggage but it was an easy Uber ride from the port and their was ample luggage storage at the Space Centre. Was a great attraction but slightly overwhelming on",
          "Where to start? The whole visit was amazing and I could easily have spent an extra day there but there wasn't time... If you have a geek streak, or even if you don't, make sure you visit. Signage to help you navigate around the building is a bit sparse but that in no way",
          "Took friends from out of State there and they loved it. They are moving to Houston and even bought the annual membership too",
          "Huge thanks to our guide Holly and our driver Brenda for a superb and very informative tour today. Walking around right inside the newly restored original/historic Mission Control, exploring the Space Vehicle Mock Up Facility to see the ISS and capsules (Soyuz and Orion) up",
          "This place needs to be re-organized, updated, and get rid of their member only lines and admission. What a joke! I'll start with their Member Only Program. Basically if you buy 4 tickets it justifies being a member which is about the cost of 4 tickets. I bought 4 tickets but",

          "We visited the museum on a Monday, loads of parking spaces, friendly staff from the start of the day to the end. We prebooked our tickets so collected them from the welcome desk. As I was recovering from an injury and surgery to my ankle the museum does have a store of",
          "The space center Houston was a must see attraction on our list and it was well worth our visit. As seniors we enjoyed mission control and remembering how we experienced the different voyages and landing on the moon. The young adults were interested in looking at where the space",
          "Very interesting museum, displays, and tours. There are 3 different tours-it would be nice if you could take the shuttle once to get to see each place instead of having to waiting in line 3 different times along with the shuttle.",
          "Lots of static as well as interactive exhibits. Also had some live presentations. Highlight is the (free) tour to Mission Control as it looked during the first landing on the moon in July 1969. This has only been open a few months and is very impressive. I would advise",
          "Very disappointed with the 11:30am tram tour 9 Sept. PA system was very poor and the tour guide spoke non stop. What may have been interesting was lost. His running commentary was most inappropriate for the majority of visitors for whom English was their second language.",
          "Spent a whole day here with my friend and thoroughly enjoyed it. We especially like the tram tour to the Control Room that as been restored to 1969!",
          "Should be on a bucket list !! it\u2019s a fabulous activity for adults and children of all ages! there\u2019s something for everyone! Go see it!",
          "with no doubt, this visit must be on the lifetime To-Do list, quite an amazing experience for someone who saw tons of TV footage but never lived in the states nor seen this live.",
          "It was a great day for the kids and adults. Lots to see and do. Was easy to keep the kids entertained. There are a lot of people. Must get there early.",
          "I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect before coming here from overseas, but I loved this place. The Space Center really brings back the romanticism of space travel but was fascinating as well. There was so much to see it was hard to pick a favourite, although I liked the Mission to Mars",
          "It was too crowded and hot, I almost pass out from heat exhaustion. The cut down the place you can see because of the huge crowd. Tram was so slow and the line was very long. I don\u2019t recommend Anyone to visit it during summer time. Lots of tourists because of school holidays.",
          "I waited a couple of weeks to write a review, hoping that the \"meh\" would wear off some. My wife and I were in Houston and planned an extra day to see and tour the Johnson Space Center. We both grew up in the Apollo era, and have been space history fans ever since. So, here",
          "The best exhibit seems to be the shuttle which can be viewed in the parking lot. Inside there are lots of flashing lights and stuff to keep kids busy, though the team tours get you closest to the historic spots. Those tours involve waiting in line to get on, then waiting to",
          "I took my grandsons who are 8 & 10 in August and they are still talking about Space Center Houston! They thoroughly enjoyed the hands on exhibits and the rides simulating space flight. They did complain about the long line for the shuttle ride around the campus but decided it",
          "Unique for sure The shuttle is a replica, as is most of the exhibits, the tram takes you thru what was formerly no doubt a beahive of activity. By far the rocket park, with the huge indoor rocket is the capper of the day",
          "It has recently changed.So whatever you read around now there is only one tram trip (no more red o blue lines.) It is very well organized the tour coordinator travels with you in the tramp and to all the stations. The tour last about 1,30 hours. When you finish the tram tour you",
          "Being history buffs, we had an amazing day at the Space Center. So much history of America\u2019s Space Race and the subsequent exploration all in one location. Well worth your time and the cost of admission.",
          "Unbelievable experience! The level 9 tour, while expensive, is totally worth it! You get an air conditioned van to travel around in all day. Trust me, on hot days, you\u2019re going to want that! I saw people on the tram with soaking wet shirts from sweat b/c it was in the",
          "Super interesting museum and tons of exhibits. You definitely get a much better feel for what life is like in space. We sprang for extra and did the virtual reality experience and loved it. There was for sure a ton of thought put into this museum and what they wanted visitors'",
          "This centre is well worth a visit. From the sight of a shuttle on the back of a 747 to seeing the original 1960\u2019s mission control, to a present day mission control room and a real Apollo rocket - Wow! Give it a day of your time.",
          "The exhibits are all very good and interesting. The centre is large enough to accommodate large busy groups of visitors without being crowded. Everything including mission control room is great. Large restaurants and varied options. Thoroughly recommended this attraction.",
          "I mean, what can you say about this place other than the fact it is absolutely AMAZING!! Actually the Space Centre was the main reason for me wanting to visit Houston and it certainly did not disappoint. There was so much information and so much to learn about. I loved seeing",
          "We went to the Space Center from Houston arriving at about noon. The tram ride about the complex was just so good, allowing us to see things we have only seen, in part, on TV. We then went to look over the space shuttle and carrier aircraft, it is so large! The exhibits show the",
          "When you first walk in, it seems that this place is just that!....but once I get enggaged with all the history and the information about what NASA has accomplished, I was very impressed. Not only educative, it is entertaining too. I love the fact that we got to see up close and",
          "Decent day out. Interesting to see the mission control room that will oversee NASA's Mars Orion programme, and tour the astronaut training facilities. Costs about $29 to get in, which includes a trolley ride around the huge facility with a few stop offs. You'll need at least a",
          "The Space Centre was the main reason that we went to Houston and it did not disappoint! We took our 10 & 11yo sons here and they absolutely loved it. We were there for a whole day and almost ran out of time to do everything they wanted to do! There us a lot of really",
          "we were lucky the weather wasnt too bad but the place was pretty crowded, loved the space shuttle on the airplane exhibit the most very interesting. over all a great experience if you visit Houston",
          "My hubby and I just returned to our hotel room after the Level 9 VIP Tour and it was worth every penny. We got David Cisco as our Guide and he was a technician who worked on the Lunar Module (LM\u2014pronounced LEM) starting back in 1968 at Gruman Northrop on Long Island. He worked",
          "Our plan was to visit Mission Control at the space center. After paying our entry fee, we went straight to the tram ticket area for details on the tour. The person manning the tram entrance gave us instructions for the tour we requested and sent us to visitor services. The",
          "This was a once in a lifetime fabulous experience! The tram tour round the camp was amazing lots of sites you would never get to see and the inside knowledge you hear is incredible this is by far one of the best tours we have ever done and it\u2019s a must if you come to Houston! We",
          "This place is so cool! Fun for all ages. We unfortunately only had a couple hours to spend here, but could have easily explored longer. The exhibits were interesting and provided historical details related to NASA and the space program. There were many interactive areas that",
          "Loved it. Loved looking at the rockets through the ages. Slick tour and well worth it to get so upfront and close to some of the rockets.",
          "We had a very informative and interesting visit to the Space Center. We had previously also visited the Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama. We loved the interactive displays, and the full history of the space journey throughout the years.",
          "Lots to do, highly interactive, fun and entertaining. Very informative and totally loved it apart from one thing - communication. On trams the speaker could not be heard because she failed to ask people to not talk through the ride so those near us did talk all the way and",
          "It\u2019s a great place to visit for all ages. The facility try\u2019s to make sure that the attractions are suitable for all ages. It\u2019s great to see the Apollo mission control and realize what a fantastic feat it was to land on the moon with the technology of that period.",
          "Great place to learn about the space station and missions. Would be great for a family trip (plenty for children to do) but I felt because there wasn't the crowd of people I expected there, the demonstrations fell flat and the tour was over far too quickly; we felt quite rushed",
          "We arrived at the Space Center Houston, purchased our tickets outside and then entered the large hall of exhibits which were amazing. Unfortunately you are not given a map or any directions and so you are left to wander around the various exhibits in a totally random way. We",
          "Me and my partner had a really nice day here today - the tram tour being a highlight as well as touching a piece of moon rock. I do have to say that some of the exhibits are a little lacking - I don\u2019t know what was going on in one of the cinemas but it seemed to have very",
          "Space Center Houston is a great venue for children to adults. All of our space programs history and some actual items used to go into space and used in space are there. Great learning area for children. Go early and plan to spend many hours while there.",
          "Amazing experience to go through the real labs and the real satellites stored at the center. The digital shows and other fun activities are also good for family time",
          "We recently went on a tour in Space Center Houston and it was interesting and worth the time and cost. We live in the area and it was always so convenient that we never got there. This is a hidden gem in our backyard. Considering people on our tour came from New Zealand and",
          "If you love space and museums, you wlll love this place. It is not just for kids, you can learn so much about every space mission and see a real spaceship. The souvenir shop is amazing.",
          "Visited while in Houston. A must if you are in town and have the time. My wife and I drove down and spent several hours wandering round the museum. It is well laid out and very informative as well as interesting. If you have kids there is certainly plenty to keep them occupied.",
          "Worth checking out if visiting Houston. Go early... it gets busy by lunchtime. So much to see and learn! There are a few hands on activities for kids.",
          "This is just pure geek fun! Driving up to the center and seeing the shuttle atop the 747 airliiner set the entire mood. Stepping inside, I met a young girl who wants to be a future astronaut. Seeing her standing at the Space Center, I can imagine one day saying, \"I knew her",
          "The site was great to visit and.to learn about space history but the entry fee was terrible. There is no reason for the entry fee to be so much. The tram line tours are nice but the lines are between 45 minutes to an hour or more for each one. You would was your full visit by",
          "If you are in Houston, you shouldn't miss the opportunity to visit the Space Center in Houston, especially if you have children between 8-14. This is the 50 year anniversary of our flight to the moon and a great time to share this history with your kiddos.",
          "We've been members of Space Center Houston for the past couple of years. We bought their friends & family package which includes unlimited admission for up to 6 (plus free parking) for a year, plus 2 guest passes. It is nice because we are only 10 minutes away so we can just",
          "one of a kind inn Houston - even if there never launched a rocket here you can smell the orbit all around -",
          "If interested in 'the space race' in a limited way, & visiting Houston, then the Houston Space Centre will not disappoint. But those with more intelligence will quickly get bored with the limited displays within the building. The simulators are not included in the entry price",
          "We visited the Space Centre and decided to do the Level 9 VIP Tour. It was well worth the extra expense. Our tour ran from 11:00am until 4:30. During that time we were shown around the facility by Neal, an extremely knowledgeable tour guide who went above and beyond",
          "The space center is the best place to visit if you are in Houston (Texas). Its is a half day trip and you can view the various technologies with space and craft and a must go place for kids.",
          "We booked our visit with NASA's Space Center & Houston's Official City Tour, a great way to do it, everything organised and the tours where well hosted. We ran out of time to do everything but overall it was quite interesting, it is well worth going to see.",
          "We visited the Space Centre in September. The center is quite big and has a lot of information, but the highlight is the tram tour. It lasts 1.5h and our guide Addison was very good, he gave us a lot of interesting facts and information. We got to see the mission control",
          "For 2 people it was about 2 1/2 hour visit. It was very interesting going through a shuttle and plane carrier. Lots of hands on for the kids. The cafe area food is expensive.",
          "Great exhibts includes toura/ 3 max space movie exhibits. Great people. Many tour guides are extremly knoledgeble for they retirrd from NASA. My dad was a guide afylter more than 35+ years with Nasa that preceeded the building of Johnson Space center. Deffinatly GO. One of the",
          "Interesting to visit once. For children and young people, is fun. It could be very hot in summer. I recommend to buy tickets on line with priority entrance.",
          "Wow. This place is amazing and a must see for anyone interested in space. My wife and I and her parents spent almost six hours here exploring and learning about the space program. We went on both trams tours which is a must. On the first one, we saw the backup ISS control room,",
          "Went with a friend who lives in Austin, he got a membership (which is worth about two regular day tickets), which gave us a discount on our tickets and gave us priority for both the tours, enabling us to go on both the astronaut training tours and control centre tours. Unless",
          "A must visit for people who are interested in science and to see how things work in the space. Friendly staff, just be aware that for vegetarians not many options to eat, else a fantastic and a must place to visit.",
          "Very interesting grandkids age 4 thru 12 really enjoyed it.Go early as lines for tram rides get longer later in the day plus it's cooler. Food is a little pricey so take snacks or do as we did an order 2 orders of tenders(comes with plenty of fries) and share.Overall great",
          "My wife and I decided to take a few days and get away. We visited the Space Center in Houston on its 50 year anniversary of the Moon Landing. We had visited this facility when our kids were your 30+ years ago. We were both impressed with the entire facility and learned a lot",
          "We visited here early August and it was very hot. We went straight to the trams as recommended by our guide and it was so disorganised. The people working on the lines didn\u2019t seem to know what they were doing. We waited a long time and although they had fans the heat was getting",
          "First time with my 10 year old. I recommend going straight to guest services and asking for the lay of the land and the must do\u2019s! We went there for a map and learned they don\u2019t have any! However, going straight there set our visit in the right direction! We ended with",
          "I visited with my friend and it's really great experience and having something new which we never seen before.",
          "Went to Space Center to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing. We arrived about 15 minutes before the doors opened and left at closing time. Even being there all day we did not see everything we wanted to! We were just 2 adults - no kids...there is even more to do",
          "Liked the remodeled mission control center, was a awesome experience.... was good to go early buy time we left it was packed. Let\u2019s go to moon again.",
          "Cool place! Definitely worth going to if you are in the Houston, TX area! Enjoyed my time, definitely recommend for children and families.",
          "NASA is most definitely worth a visit if you\u2019re in Houston and is suitable for kids of all ages. Do make sure you allow enough time to see everything - you can easily fill a whole day. Also it\u2019s almost worth buying the member pass even if you\u2019re not going to go back, as it",
          "Amazing experience! The historical Apollo missions control room is wonderful - make sure you get on board of the tram getting you there quite early, otherwise you may wait an hour and a half or so in line. Great exhibitions and meetings with astronauts.",
          "Very very good museum, with every level of explanation, various type of activities for every age. A must do if you have the opportunity",
          "If you want an authentic NASA experience look no further! This is a real working facility. Here are some tips: - Skip the exhibits and movies and head straight to the tram tours when you first arrive. The lines move painfully slow and become even longer as the day goes on so",
          "I felt like a child. The visit is very interesting and all the areas well organized. I went two days in a row and they were always amazing!",
          "Starting with a 90 minute double decker bus tour ( with Ryan as our driver) was great. Showed up all the points of interest in Houston & his information about the city was first rate. We then changed buses to travel in air conditioned comfort to Space Centre Houston.",
          "A whole day inst enough time to see everything that they have here. Very informative tram tour, and lots of interactive exhibits to choose from. The souvenir store has good swag.",
          "I went to see this place on a business trip. I was amazed at how awesome the exhibits were. Seeing the space shuttle up close and missing control is incredible!",
          "Visiting the NASA center is to be done, what is a bit disappointing it\u2019s too much for kids, so don\u2019t expect a lot of learning! This been said worth doing it.",
          "My husband and I stopped at the Space Center on our way down to Galveston, and I'm so glad we did. Tons of stuff to see and do!. The tram lines were very long, but with it being included in the price of admission, I can't complain too much. I wish we had more time to spend",
          "I bought my ticket online before arrival (it said it was good for a year following purchase) and avoided the line ups. I arrived right at opening time and it wasn't too busy yet. I immediately went to get a timed ticket for the Apollo control room to do that first thing. The",
          "A must do for any space lover. Lots of moon artifacts and information on the various space missions that have occurred. Seeing the Saturn V rocket is a must. The center does get busy but we found that doing the tours earlier eliminated having to interact with big crowds.",
          "Space Center Houston is perhaps the largest repository of artifacts, vehicles, equipment and information from the space race and beyond, but they need to get some of the NASA engineers to figure out a better tram system. We wanted to go to Mission Control and Rocket Park (which",
          "Amazing experience. Must do while in Houston. We arrived really early to get on the first tram ride so everything was quiet and not crowded. You get to see mission control, Orion complex and Saturn V. Then back to the visitor centre. Don\u2019t miss the shuttle on the 747 in",
          "We came here just for a couple of hours and ended up spending most of the day. If space is your thing, it\u2019s a great day out to celebrate what we have achieved - lots to do and see for all ages, a great day out",
          "The only way to get a 5-star experience is if you show up when the park opens, if you arrive even 1 hour after it begins to fill up with children and becomes a playground (as others have mentioned). Go early and take the tram FIRST thing on whatever you want to learn about (2",
          "We have previously visited Kennedy space center in Florida, which we found very well organized, educational and entertaining. We arrived at Space Center Houston to find what a previous reviewer called an over crowded playground. When I inquired at guest services about exhibits",
          "This is a great educational experience for the whole family. Extremely informative. Great way to motivate your children!!",
          "The staff here is outstanding. They are clearly well trained and treated fairly- you can tell they enjoy what they do and have fun, but take pride in their work and represent the Space Center wonderfully. If you go, go early! Once it gets crowded, it\u2019s very overwhelming. Invest",
          "We made this a stop on our way to Galveston; this place has so much to do it can be a whole day activity. Perfect for those with young kids. If you are going now during the summer, there is a lot of outside activities and tours. Take sunscreen and a bottle of water. The shops",
          "Mainly wanted to see the space shuttle and carrier and the new Apollo 50th Anniversary display. Waited for tram to take us out there in hot temperatures. Fan only hits you if you are lucky one next to it. Told us to get in line at 11:15 for 11:30 tour. Tour left almost 10",
          "I was really looking forward to going here as it's a fascinating subject. It was easy to get in, parking charge was reasonable ($5 I think), easy parking. Then walked up to the entrance and all I saw was hundreds of kids queuing to get in and it was like that from then on. I",
          "Had a great time and learned a lot. Got to see some interesting Displays commemorating landing on the moon 50 years ago. The ability to go and see the actual mission control was really a treat and one that I would highly recommend.",
          "An excellent place to learn about the space program. Recommend planning ahead and plan on spending most of the day, there is plenty to see and do. If you have time, sign up for and do the tour that includes lunch with an Astronaut. We were too late to find a slot but it would",
          "If you suffer from anxiety, stay far away from this place. Me, my bf and our 13 yr old daughter thought this would be a great idea since everyone talks about it, wrong, wrong wrong!! I hated it so much, she hated it so much! I wanted a refund, $90 for 3 ppl. We went Sunday",
          "What a FUN way to spend the day for the whole family. After looking at all options, we chose to do the Citipass to take advantage of HUGE savings for all we wanted to do this week including the space center. We drove from the airport area and it was easy to get to. Though",
          "A lot to do at Space Station Houston. Most people stated you will spend about 6 hours there and the food is overpriced and greasy and they are right. With that said we enjoyed our visit to Johnson Space Center and the tour guide was fantastic. They do a great job of dialing",
          "This is a must visit if you are in Houston, the SCH is a great experience for all. Kids and adults will find this place very attractive and interesting. Try to visit the control center and the astronauts experience first, they are not located in the central building so you will",
          "Excellent and quite experience for my child and my professional career as engineer to meet and to remember the space technology and development along the last 50 years. Wonderful to share with my family this experience to know rockets, space modules and telemetry and control",
          "The kids had a great time and so did the adults! Got to touch a moon rock, see a real spaceship and learn about how astronauts live in space. We really enjoyed our visit.",
          "Amazing place. Remarkably inefficient process for tram tours. Could double speed of loading. Send some of your management to Disney to learn how to do this the right way.",
          "You can buy discounted tickets online before you visit, and avoid the queues. Plenty of interactive exhibits, with interesting and useful information. Tge mission control tour is excellent, although you may have to queue for a while to take the small carriages. Mock ups of",
          "We were in Houston for one day so this was a good option for a quick visit. The actual rockets and equipment that went into space are fascinating. The main area was too much like an arcade. The team tour was a little disappointing. Admission is a little pricey for what you",
          "We had a great time at the space center. The campus is enormous, designed to be like a college campus, and the trams tours that take you out to see everything are a must do. You will wait in line for a while unless you buy the membership and get priority seating. We spent our",
          "Really enjoyed the landing in the moon re-enactment and the information on Mars exploration. It was also great to see the Saturn rocket and enter the space shuttle!",
          "We did tour, best part we got tickets for both Blue and Red tram, both tours has lot of information and thing to learn my teenager enjoyed this tour in start they don't want to do they knew everything but after tour they were more happy and learned lot of new thing it was well",
          "This was my second visit to the space center. I brought my grandson for his first time this summer knowing he would love the hands-on science exhibits. Unfortunately, most of them were broken and the couple working had long waiting lines. It\u2019s confusing upon entering this huge",
          "We visited the space center in the full heat of July with teenagers. Honestly I expected to be fed up and want to leave. We ended up spending six hours checking everything out. The kids were in awe of all of the spacecraft, space suits, and other objects to view. They",
          "If you are into the space program, this is a must see. Plenty of exhibits to look at, things to try and educational for younger children. Good family entertainment.",
          "We love love love the space center! This was my 3rd visit there and it this time with my teenager as well as my parents. There was something for each age group there. DO NOT MISS THE VIRTUAL REALITY RIDE",
          "We arrived as the center opened with four hours before needing to leave for the airport. To get the most out of the day, it was important to schedule the mission control tour time first, and then to get onto one of the other tram tours. Each tram tour takes an hour to 1.5",
          "Fantastic exhibits! Really get a sense of the U.S.A. Space program. This was my husband\u2019s first time at the Space Center. He absolutely loved viewing all the exhibits. All ages would gain in a visit to this center.",
          "Fantastic experience. Highly recommend booking lunch with an astronaut. Gets you entry, lunch and you get to meet and have a photo op with a real astronaut. I think there were 6 tables and we got to do a question/answer session with Clay Anderson, who spent time on the ISS.",
          "This place is awesome!!! I don't want to give anything away, but you learn what it takes to be an astronaut from before and what people go through to build those awesome rockets! A must see!!!",
          "We toured the Space Center and totally had a Blast! Our group was age 5-65 and there is something for everyone. Especially enjoyed seeing the Saturn 5 rocket up close and going onboard the Space Shuttle. The food court was also great for lunch.",
          "I brought my brother to the Space Center for his 50th Birthday. So I recommend the Space Center for kids of all ages. He had a blast!",
          "The tours to the training center and mission control are free. They give you lots of great information and a behind the scenes perspective.",
          "This was a real mixed bag for us. The exhibits and displays in the main centre were ok. Many were not working with signs on them apologising. The rocket science presentation could have been great, but it wasn\u2019t. The content was good. The delivery was like when PowerPoint was",
          "We had the chance to go to Kennedy Space Center in Florida before going to Houston and this made Space Center Houston to seem really disappointing compared to Florida one. There was much less to see and do, they transport you with some open trams which are horrible (take long,",
          "Great day. We spent about 5 1/2 hours here. Space Center Houston is a big museum. A lot of hands on for younger kids. There are some virtual reality exhibits but cost extra money. There is a gift shop and Food Court. From HSC you can get a tram tour to Johnson Space center,",
          "A wonderful way to spend a couple of hours with the family. The price of admission was 30 bucks. Very interesting to see how brave the earlier astronauts had to be to travel in space with such antiquated equipment. Great history lesson for the young kids.",
          "First off the attractions in the space center are awesome. They have plenty of neat things to see, especially the Apollo mission control room, but their facilities need serious upgrades. They have very little fans or cooling systems outside, so if you go in the summer prepare to",

          "I am so glad I checked reviews of the Space Center because the whole experience can be confusing. One review said to get there at opening and skip the entry building and \"hop on the blue shuttle\". We were so glad that we did. There were few people the first hour and we were",
          "What an amazing experience. It\u2019s all there. The history, the technology, and the bravery and courage of the astronauts. It was not expensive to get in. The crowd management was excellent. All in all very good and well worth a visit to this historic site, but still doing",
          "They put a man on the moon but can control crowds or lines? The positives are the exhibits and the food court, although expensive, $60 for a family of 3, was clean as well as the bathrooms. However it was a high traffic day and the line waiting to get on the tour tram was all",
          "My family went to Houston for the 50th anniversary of the moon landing. The Johnson Space Center is incredible. I was 8 when Apollo 11 landed and they had the original mission control room set up exactly as it was in 1969. There is a visual presentation of the last 10 minutes",
          "We recently visited Houston for a week and took a day for NASA. It is certainly interesting, educational and a great experience. It is also quite crowded but that is to be expected for summer holidays. Worth the visit!",
          "We were there, you missed it! Great fun on Saturday, July 20, 2019 celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing. We bought tickets ahead of time to visit and also go to the concert in the evening. Thousands of people visited, lectures, movies, astronauts,",
          "If you\u2019re in Houston, you should definitely make the effort to go to Space Center Houston. It provides a great chronological history of the history of NASA from the start of the Mercury Program through and including the Space Shuttle. All very interesting and demonstrates what",
          "Simply awesome to see the real thing. Be there at opening time and go directly to the tram for Johnson Space Center (JSC) because queues are building up very fast. Its awesome to see the Saturn rocket, Mission Control rooms, training facilities and the Apollo Mission Control",
          "What can you say about the NASA Space Center. The place is amazing. The exhibits truly show the history of space exploration and the static displays are fascinating. If you want to see everything including all the tram tours plan o. 4-6 hours. It is a bit pricey and they do",
          "Went on a Sunday when the offices were closed. The place was packed with people. Arrived at 10:30am and didn't leave until 5:00pm. The placed closed at 6:00pm. There is so much to see. The have a longhorn bull on property they said was worth $500,000.",

          "We spent the most part of a day checking out the museum and the planes outside. Took the tram to the site to catch tours to two other locations in the area. Mission control was one. There were two trips one could take each lasting approximately 45 minutes. They did not cost",

          "So incredible!! When I was in middle school, I always dreamt that I would wake up the next morning to find out that my parents were sending me to Space Camp. Well, that never happened...so this was the next best thing. It was extremely busy due to the amount of people for the",
          "I guess its a must if you are in Houston but we were excited for 5 min then realized theres not much. My kids were bored to death and trams take a while to get there. Lota of waiting not much to interact with. Only recommended for space people. Very expensive and got nothing out",

          "I guess one would want to come here when visiting Houston since this is something we are known for, and also, there is not much else to do in Houston. But alas, the place is only barely interesting. Exhibits don\u2019t give you any in-depth information. Nothing to really intrigue or",

          "What an experience! Myself and 5 friends were recently in Houston for the NEA Convention and were able to spend a day at the Johnson Space Center. From the moment you drive into the parking lot, you are excited to be there. We were told by our hotel concierge to do the Blue tram",
          "We joined a tour with All-star and we were the only two guests. Our guide happened to be a volunteer at the centre there as well and knows his way around. Due to its vastness the visit can be a bit confusing but with a guide it was easy. It is a great exhibition to better",
          "Enjoyed our visit here but did not think it was worth taking the tram to the mission control centre. Stopped at one place, then drove around parking lots showing us buildings where people worked. Other than that, the rest of it was awesome and interesting.",
          "My Family and I got here 30mins after opening and was able to get a close parking spot. We went inside and headed straight for the trams. We were able to take all the tours that were offered without any wait which was nice. I'd recommend bringing a refillable water bottle",

          "One of our stops while in TX on vacation and we loved it. So interactive and really kept my 9 year old interested. We were able to do 2 out of 3 tours on the tram. Wish we had done them first because the lines were extremely long and we ran out of time. Prices are reasonable for",
          "This is a must see if you are in the area. Make it a destination! Everything you have ever wanted to know about space, living in space, and what is NASA doing now is answered. If you are taking a family of 4 and want to do everything, go ahead and buy the family",
          "Great tours. Lots to see. Great movies and exhibits. Better for older children they removed the area for little kids. Prices are reasonable. There is a large snack area with drinks. Do the tours first. Our presenter at Mission control was funny and inspiring.",
          "One of the stops on our 2 week vacation, definitely worth a stop to check out. A lot of space history, moon and mars rock you can touch. Space shuttle and airplane you can go in as well as several other exhibits. Tram to Johnson Space center we didn't have time to check out.",
          "My grandkids love coming back every year. We do find something new every time we go. Rad Rhonda is very entertaining while she is educating the kids. My grandkids going back to see her every time we go. They are real fans. Seeing the Apollo rocket is mind boggling.",

          "This is a place to go with kids. The center itself lends itself to entertaining kids 8-16. The tours are bit clunky with you having to take one tram to get to a choice of two trams on the Johnson property proper. We went on the mission control tour, which if you have never been",
          "This was hands down an amazing experience. So much to see and do, we spent a whole day there and we had a range of ages. We all thoroughly enjoyed it and definitely learnt a lot of things. Highly recommend",

          "Enjoyable visit. Great displays and plenty for school aged children to explore. The only negative was the lack of information and site plans etc. We went on a tram to Johnson Space Centre and looked through the rocket shed, but nothing told us about the other 2 tours leaving",
          "It's awesome to be able to visit the actual buildings that are still doing research for NASA. It is a lot of time outdoors on the tram so be prepared to be HOT! So interesting to see how the astronauts live on the shuttle and ISS.",
          "Didn\u2019t think I would be enthused to visit the Space Center but I was wrong. I learned a lot about spacecrafts, and how they actually live inside while traveling. I even learned more about our galaxy. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the area."

          "It is closed until July first. Website updated the day we got here so didn't know.   The guy at the gate was rude about it.  I hope we get to come back someday and the people are nicer.",
          "Great tours and displays, especially if you are fascinated with space exploration. Live demonstration of life in the space station was detailed and fascinating. Experience the drama of Armstrong's first step.",
          "Thumbs up to NASA. A really educational experience. Can't wait to go back",
          "Interesting exhibits for all ages. Educational yet fun. Many things to read so plan several hours just for tje exploration exhibit. \nWe had a two dollar per person coupon with no printed expiration but ticket booth employee said it wad \u2026",
          "First time here, it's so COOL. Going back with our kids. The guy at the gate where you pay for parking was very friendly and helpful. Where I paid for my ticket, wasn't friendly. The folks taking pictures wasn't helpful. The older lady in \u2026",
          "It was fascinating to have visits the space center. Something different from what you see on the TV screen.\nAfter the visit. We understand how tough it is to be an astronaut and the routine they have to go through to become one. Very interesting.",
          "The space center offers so much educational information for both adults and children. Surprisingly, we always end up learning something new about space and how everything coordinates together each time we visit. For the most, yes it will be \u2026",
          "Think twice about visiting during Christmas week if you have a choice as the crowds are massive. We were there for about 4 hours and spent over 3 hours in lines. There are amazing things to see like the shuttle and the Saturn V rocket, \u2026",
          "My family and I got to visit during the Galaxy light show and we were beyond impressed. It was the most amazing light show I had seen and very well organized. The staff members here are very helpful and kind. I loved coming here and learning so much!",
          "This place is awesome. We went for a weekend and toured the facilities which are still in use. Lots of fun and historical things to learn. Free roaming animals in the campuses. Definitely check it out.",
          "This place is amazing! Take your kids or just yourself. There's plenty to do and see. Exhibits are well thought out and displayed. Well worth the price of admission.",
          "We purchased the Level 9 tour. Wow we had a great time behind the scenes, the recreation of \nMission Control,  Saturn Rocket. Our tour guide was Neil . Neil has so much knowledge on the Space  Center. Just a fun day",
          "We loved meeting an astronaut and seeing mission control! Kids loved the numerous activities. \nOn the other hand, it was so crowded that we had to wait in lines to see many of the hands-on displays and there are loads of \"opportunities\" that you have to pay extra for. I wasn't expecting that.",
          "Not too bad. Long wait for the tram rides, but WAY worth the wait. Quite a few places for lunch to go to. Keep in mind to get a membership and download the app for less of a wait. They have some simulation rides for 6$,8$, and 10$. Very memorable experience. They also have HUMONGOUS Saturn V rocket on display.",
          "I got to take my dad here when he was in town. He'd always been a science nerd and this was a kind of fulfillment for him. I'm so glad I got to be a reason for him to go. Besides that, I had fun walking around being philosophical and remembering when I seriously wanted to be an astronaut. ...and the gift shop is decent.",
          "This place has changed every time I've went. It was amazing. Plenty of new things to do look at and check-out. Multiple tram tours and lots of simulators. Had a good time",
          "Good place for children. Nothing fancy, it's just a museum. The best part is Saturn V orbit rocket which is huge and gives you an idea about how different propulsion system and engines combines to make a big space rocket. That's awesome. \u2026",
          "So much to do!!! I could easily spend everyday for a week here and not have time for it all! I understand why people become members! Gift shop prices are reasonable for any souvenirs you'd want, and the food court has a huge variety of \u2026",
          "Obviously this place is everything you expect and more. There's so much to take in and even more history to learn. I recommend taking a tour, just go in a group and have stand in that long line. This place pays respect to every little piece \u2026",
          "If you go to Houston it is a place you must visit. There are incredible things. I recommend going during the week and arriving early to enjoy the tour.",
          "It was a nice place to visit. Overall I don't recommend this for adults that don't have kids. It is very kid oriented. I did enjoy the interactive stations, it just gets a little awkward when a child is waiting for you to be done. I wish \u2026",
          "Had a really good experience. They have provided well descriptive facts about space programs. Better to download space center app before you go there and plan your visit, if you have allocated only one day for the visit. Because one day is not enough to cover all the tours and exhibits.",
          "So fun I got CNN astronaut watch Apollo 11 going to ship and see lots of fun stuff. The tours were amazing and so cool to do. We got to see where everyone at NASA works",
          "Very educational and fun place. You should definitely get the membership even when you are not live in Houston. The member priority boarding will save you so much time when boarding the tour bus. Unless you like to stay in a super long line \ud83d\ude01",
          "My son is really into space. When I found out that they were having galaxy lights I knew we had to go. There were so many interactive light displays that you could be apart of. My step sister and brother in law, their three little kids and \u2026",
          "If you like standing in line waiting for a tram that'll basically takes you nowhere then this is the place for you. They no longer take you to see mission control so the trams are no longer worth the trouble. Stay in the main bldg and check out all that it has to offer instead.",
          "Super fun day to come to NASA on this tremendous return to space from American launched craft",
          "It was a great time here, changed so much since I was young. Certainty worth every bit of the price. So many things to see,and the tours are great. A must for everyone visiting houston.",
          "Such a great facility!! It was a blast and there was so much information about space travel. I would definitely suggest going there more than once because the amount of information and the amount you can do can\u2019t be done in one day. Also don\u2019t forget to do the tram ride it was one of the best parts of the facility.",
          "Houston we have a problem!!! An awesome experience,  if you\u2019re in the Houston area you must see.  Just make sure you bring extra hand sanitizer.  There\u2019s a lot of interactive things to play with.  Children friendly also.  It\u2019s cheaper than \u2026",
          "An educational tour. Great for young and old. Come early. It would take a whole day to explore the area. Tram tour will take up most of your time.  Bring water and some snacks. Food is a bit pricey. But having lunch in the cafeteria would \u2026",
          "This is a great place to get a good idea of the history, and scale of some of these projects. The tour to the Apollo 11 control center is ehh, but I'd definitely check out the moon rock exhibit. Good for kids and Adults but great for neither",
          "Nice place once in a life time learning new things experience",
          "Amazing. So much to see here. We did the tour on the trolley around the park. Went into the control centre. Very interesting. Memorials and tributes to past astronauts and lots of info on the day to day work they are carrying out. Lots of space mission information. Brilliant shop to buy souvenirs.",
          "Even as an adult, I love this place.  There is so much to see and do here.  Be prepared to spend at least 4-5 hours here.  You can spend all day here and not get bored. \n\nTours are nice. Exhibitions are nicely presented.  Facility is clean and staff is helpful.\n\nCons:  gift shop and cafeteria are pricy.",
          "Very large place.it has a big parking lot which cost 5$. liked the tram ride which was around 90 min. They take to offices, simulation centres. The best part was the building with a huge rocket. Awesome. A must visit in houston.",
          "Fun Place to learn about space and aeronautical expeditions. They have guided tours to the Mission control center that assisted the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. There are tons of other exhibit that kids and adults would enjoy.",
          "Having lived through the development of the space program, I found the exhibits fascinating. They brought back memories of what I was doing and the societal importance. If time is limited, the tram ride is relatively low content for the \u2026",
          "Disappointed with this. Smaller than I thought. Seems a little outdated? The first shop is bigger than some exhibits. There most definitely some cool opportunities like touching the moon, mars, and a meteorite and some of the kid sections. \u2026",
          "An experience that's out of this world! Make sure you grab a free ticket to the tram rides so you don't have to wait a long time in the lines. You really need a whole day here, as 4 hours wasn't enough! Will definitely be going back when I'm in the area again \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\ude80",
          "Need to bring money to experience  what your first thought it would be because everything you want cost extra. Also would recommend coming early cause takes time to view everything. Other than that very informational, but photos shouldn't \u2026",
          "Fun as always. I try to go periodically when I get to Houston to keep up on the progress of our space program. My wife went for the first time with me recently and loved it as well.",
          "Amazing to see some of the things NASA has built. You really can't appreciate a full sized rocket until you're standing next to it. I had a great time.",
          "I took the Orion Tram tour. The guides are very accomplished in what they do. So many exciting milestones expertly packaged in one beautiful narrative.  Would go again soon!",
          "Very poor organization and crowd control. Tram to exhibits is first come first served and has extremely long wait times. Experience could easily be improved by giving visitors a time / number for the tram. This is what is done at most other high volume tourist sights. It's not rocket science.",
          "We camped out last night at the Space Center. It was awesome! All the amazing things my kids and I learned will be unforgettable. Highly recommend visiting.",
          "If you go, get there as soon as it is open and get on the tram immediately. The lines were three hours long when we arrived, so we skipped it and just enjoyed our time in the main building. Everything is included in the ticket price, which is nice, so we still spent a few hours there.",
          "Had an enjoyable visit.  There were lots of exhibits covering the past, current and future space exploration which kept everyone interested.  In addition there are live talks with astronauts and other NASA personnel.",
          "Absolutely one of the best space centers I've visited and the tour was great. My teen boys even enjoyed this. The size of the shuttle's, engines and equipment is just gigantic! A must see to believe.",
          "How could a historical space center not be one of the coolest places on earth?? It does NOT disappoint! Lots to do and see. Very interactive. Went to their holiday lights event this year and that was pretty amazing.",
          "Excellent place to discover the history of our country in space. Highly recommended for teenagers and adults interested in the subject. wonderful experience",
          "Very good, really met my expectations in a good way! Excellent.",
          "If I haven't been to Kennedy Space Center, this would have been a fairly enjoyable trip. However, by comparison, it's just so so. The main building have some interactive exhibitions but there are not too many. Then, you have to wait in a \u2026",
          "Nothing to explain here... If yoh are a space folks you will enjoy it..\nPlease get your tickets online to avoid last min rush\nIt's a one time experience for us coming from totally different country...\nEverything was amazing here....",
          "I was very disappointed.  We went, thinking it would be a very educational experience.  It was more like a fun house for kids.  There was no guidance to get people through the displays, no narrative in the \"movie\".  We feel we were robbed of $55.",
          "Shared wonderful experiences with our grandson on this Sunday afternoon. We Highly recommend taking your family or even going by yourself! Learning made Fun, brought to you by JSC. We had a Blast!",
          "Enjoyed Galaxy Lights! Loved the light exhibits and stuff to do at the Space Center. The Holiday In Space show was fun. Something different to do in the city and to get out of the house. You can make s\u2019mores outside too! Overall a fun experience!",
          "Great and memorable experience. One major downside is the tram system. It\u2019s not well optimized, you feel like you\u2019re constantly waiting in queues to take trams from point A to point B.",
          "Great experience for the little ones. \nThe Orion Capsule looks more better since they took out the lawn chairs and cotter pins and replaced with a more solid structure. I still don't think it needs chairs at all, but the new ones are \u2026",
          "Great museum. You can easily spend a day here if you are into space. Very good exhibitions and tours. The tour to the training centre is the best and it is included in the entry ticket. I highly recommend to do it!",
          "AWESOME, AMAZING!! Don't miss this stop during your travels. Don't miss the tram tour . It's free with your admission fee. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit.",
          "NASA is definitely a landmark of the Houston area. You must visit and learn about the multiple missions carried out. Beware the place gets crowded, so try to get there early so you can enjoy the most.",
          "We loved the tour on the train. The tour guide was tough in cheek funny and the exhibits were informative. Our toddler loved the children areas. A must see if in the Houston area.",
          "I took my wife and two year old daughter to see Galaxy Lights and I was kinda disappointed at the light show. I guess I just expected more from NASA. The lights in the ceiling as you entered, that was choreographed to music, was the best part. The rest was... meh \ud83d\ude15",
          "Enjoyed visiting the Space Center Houston! Luckily, I went on a day it wasn't to busy. Also, I saw a manger who didn't have the best attitude and he was acting annoyed because something didn't go his way. I was told he was a manger by \u2026",
          "The moment we got in, we went straight ahead to the tram tour, we thought it was a good idea since it just opened. And we're right, the moment we got back, the line to the team was long. \nBefore we took the tour, the staff explained to us \u2026",
          "Wonderful experience. I was ony way back from my country and my husband decided to have a short vacation before we travel back to Dallas. The experience was awesome for my 4 year old. We too enjoyed the real stuff behind the successful \u2026",
          "Wonderful place to visit with friends and family. So much to learn and see. There are several theaters with ample seating to review details on the space program. A large eating area if you get hungry. There are two tram rides to visit the \u2026",
          "We've been coming here for years and they've really built the place up great. The tram rides are always fun, and seeing the Saturn V rocket is impressive. The newly furnished Mission Control is a must see. Great for locals, and of course it's definitely a place to bring folks visiting from out of town.",
          "This is an amazing experience and a must visit for anyone visiting Houston. The tours are very detailed and the entire experience is very informative. The right attraction for all ages.",
          ".Lots of interactive displays.  Good for children and adults.  There are pop up experiments with local scientists and engineers so you can interact with them and ask questions.  Make sure to ride the tram to the Apollo rocket area near the longhorn cattle.",
          "Great place for visitors with kids. Educates on the space program and is filled with fun activities. Food to purchase there as well. Dont forget to sign up for the tour.",
          "Amazing tram tour and gallery with space artifacts.\n\nThe museum itself could be better laid out as it is overwhelming when you first enter and hard to figure out what is where... but all on all, a great place to visit.",
          "It's great to experience things related to space.. best was the Saturn rocket, it's great to see that.. you have to go early to cover all possible things within the center",
          "Lots of fun! There's so much to do and look at. We spent the whole day there and if they hadn't been closing probably would have stayed longer.",
          "Great place!  I am space geek and involved this place.  The did a nice job restoring the apollo mission control, make sure you go seen that.  The 747 with the shuttle on top is a must see also!",
          "A great day out! An experience that I\u2019ve always been dreaming off. I loved every bit! The center is full of interesting information and very well-organized. There\u2019s a bit for everyone from children to adults. The staff is helpful to guide \u2026",
          "Fun space epicenter! Awesome exhibits  well laid out. Even on busy days you can traverse easily.",
          "Would have been great but way too many people and a 3 hour wait for the tram to see only part of the complex (which we couldn't do). Would have been awesome at either half the price or half the people but the combination had me actively \u2026",
          "I read some of the one star reviews and I guess we just happened to go on a not so busy day (the day after Valentine's Day). My fiance and I spent about 4 hours here and most of it was enjoyably perusing around. The tram line was a little \u2026",
          "Best place ever! You can visit the place from 10 am to 5 pm and inside you can see all kinds of amazing stuff. You can also take a tram to the Rocket Park where you can actually see the parts of the engines that power a Saturn V rocket but \u2026",
          "Really cool place. But, don't make the same mistake as us: we got a ticket for a tram ride to the Control Center for 2:30pm. Thought it would stop at the Rocket center, but it did not. When we got back, they had stopped the  trams for the day. So, do both tram trips before you see the Space Center.",
          "The kids loved it, although it was difficult with the littler one. \n\nSo much to see and do. If you do all of the tours you could easier spend a full day here.",
          "Cool place but unacceptable arrangement of tours. I waited three hours just for a facility tour. Cannot imagine how bad the arrangement was. Tour is cool but it doesn\u2019t worth three hours standing waiting time. Worst experience I\u2019ve ever had.",
          "It's just a beautiful place to visit and bring the whole family",
          "We were so excited for this trip, based a lot of our traveling around visiting the Johnson Space Center to literally wait in line for almost 4 hours total. The space suits, interactive activities, and short film were the highlights. Other \u2026",
          "They had the galaxy lights display on this week, really awesome to see the displays. If you're into night photography this is great. There were not to many people during the week so easy enough to get to everything without feeling rushed.",
          "So exciting! Problem with Mars rocket construction though.  A close eye will reveal a defect on the large scale model! There is no US flag as is depicted in the smaller diagram below the base of the rocket!  We need a US flag in the big Mars rocket!!!",
          "As an astronomy enthusiast, I would recommend a visit to the Johnson space center to anyone who was curious about the skies above. A great experience for people of all ages to gain knowledge as well as have a nice time.",
          "The tram tour is great to get a better idea of what they do at Houston. The Spave Vehicle stop is really interesting and Independence Plaza (the 747 that carries the shuttle) is fascinating in itz own right. Very cool place to visit",
          "Had a really great time w my friends! Very informative and the rockets ship ride was awesome! OUT OF THIS WORLD\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\ude90\ud83d\udcab",
          "We went there for Galaxy Lights! Displays were vibrant and creative. Really loved the lights set to music in the main area of the center. Highly recommend.",
          "We spend almost $70 With coupons for 2 kids and an adult to have an unforgettable day. Unfortunately it took us only 30 minute to figure out all the tours and movies have 3- 3.5 hours waiting time in line because they sold too much of \u2026",
          "Pretty amazing to see the journey of mankind achieving some amazing feats in the space exploration department. Pinnacle of science comes mind when you go over the tour and work being done here. Very well organised and coordinated tour. Disabled access is available across most of the facility.",
          "More hype than actual fun and knowledge.\nMost of the things shown in trolley tour are in very old and dilapidated state. The main attraction is the main hall which had some smaller attractions. The ticket price is quite high (around 28$) and an additional 5$ for parking.",
          "Most staff were very friendly and knowledgeable.  Awesome exhibits!!  Zero G and the gift shop are way overpriced.",
          "Awesome place with lots to learn! I had a great time and could easily spend hours there. I will be back!",
          "Good space museum. A lot of exhibits and a replica Space Shuttle. Interactive displays.  The tours are interesting, but crowded. The rocket displays are impressive.",
          "Speechless, first time here and this place is just great! I suggest buy your tickets online. You can save few dollars. However is worth every penny. #cesarsphotography",
          "There was a bunch of cool things to look at, and experience!\nThey have great gift shops and little places to get drinks and food too, like Starbucks!\nIt's really fun to go with family or friends",
          "Love the space center - but make sure you have enough time for the visit. There are a lot of people and the lines can be long to get to different places.\n\nI would still recommend it highly for space and NASA buffs. Great exhibits out there.",
          "Absolutely lovely facility! We had a blast learning about the history of the US space program, and what direction it will be moving in the coming decade. We got to touch a little piece of the Moon and Mars, and look at actual pieces of \u2026",
          "Very crowded,  hard to get into some exhibits due to the high volume of visitors.  Great exhibits though,  and well worth it.  Go early and hit the control center first,  to ensure you have time.",
          "We love going here! We\u2019ve been 4 times and still haven\u2019t seen everything!! Seriously fun and educational.",
          "Tour of the campus and seeing old mission control was the best part. Easy to cruise through highlights in half a day or spend a day plus taking in everything.",
          "I had never been here and thought it would be fun to check it out I was definitely disappointed. I think it was overpriced for what they offer. I mean some stuff was cool but overall it was an average experience.",
          "Fun time for the whole family!!! My favorite part was the dude endlessly spinning in a spaceship. I also saw a girl celebrating her quinceanera! With her whole family being under 5'5 and me being 6'7 it was awkward standing in line next to them for a solid 38 minutes",
          "Great presentation about how great people helped develop training for the astronauts and the space program. Long over diet diet their part and we'll deserved recognition.",
          "This place is nice, BUT the fact that is funded with our taxes and my friends who live in HOUSTON can\u2019t afford to go, and NASA doesn\u2019t offer any free days for their own people makes it uncool. Not much diversity inside neither, which shows \u2026",
          "An excellent pace for visitors where to visit.\nIt has a lot of knowledge and information about space aircrafts and physics.\nThey present the information in a fun way to make people understand easily.\nAlso there are several tours to go , specially the galaxy light tour.\nRecommended specially for those who love physics.",
          "Fabulous place. A lot to see and I didn't make it to everything. There were 6 of us and we ended up going separate ways sometimes. Then we'd meet up and compare notes. The visit to the space command center was the first thing we saw and \u2026",
          "Honestly kind of a let down.  As cool and amazing NASA is, the tram to get to see the different exhibits was extremely packed at all time. There is also no path available to just walk to the exhibits instead.  They were more than happy to refund us our admission fees though.",
          "I had a really fun time here.  Lots of interaction with simulators.  Very cool to learn alot about space exploration.   They also have lots of exhibits set up around the museum area and a live interactive science show for all ages.  Very \u2026",
          "If your in the Houston area I would really encourage you to stop by and visit, is it a must see. For Houston I'd say, given the history. There are several different tram options to choose from (TIP: do your research prior to arriving and \u2026",
          "It has a combination of museum and field visit, do not miss reserving you seat for the field visit tramp ride as that will actually make the entire visit worth while. The have a few slots and as per my knowledge the regular last slot is at \u2026",
          "It is great to go into an actual shuttle, sitting atop it's transport jet.\nThe guided tours are informative, interesting and current. \nThe trams are open sided, so prepare for the weather when taking a tram tour.",
          "For those with a passion towards science, space or just plain geeks, this is a place you cannot skip. You can touch a moon rock or stand below the awe inspiring Saturn rocket. You can see how the astronauts train and even see how life will \u2026",
          "Great place to explore and see the space center. There are two tours, the astronauts working center and upcoming futuristic projects. Also you can explore the space ship and other exciting activities. Nice way to spend the day out.",
          "Had a conference there over the weekend. It was a great adventure. The staff treated us very well and met all our needs. The caterers were excellent as well. Got to tour the museum and after night fall went on the lighted tour it was great. \u2026",
          "I went here for a little bit it was packed we could do anything because the lines were full. It was pretty clean witch I\u2019m surprised but we were in the outside line for almost an hour. The parking was bad most people had to park on the sides. I would recommend this place only if it isn\u2019t as packed.",
          "Amazing for kids over 10 y/o and adults. The Q&A with an actual astronaut was amazing.",
          "The girls and I enjoyed our time here. They enjoyed the interactive exhibits and the especially the gift shop.",
          "If you haven't been in Space Center in cape Canaveral than visit this one for sure. Don't do virtual reality cheesy attractions, they cost $8 avg. and so outdated. Also there are self kiosks at the right of the entrance, don't waste your time in the line",
          "Great spot for all ages to learn more about the past and future of the US Space program. Lots of interactive exhibits for kids. Of note is the 747 shuttle carrier with the shuttle aboard that can be toured.",
          "The space center in Florida is way better. The tram ride around the area was less interesting than I expected. Limited areas are open for tourists/visitors unless you pay more.",
          "I guess we went when school was out or something but this place was absolutely overrun with children. Thats cool, if you're into that kinda thing. Was a decent time just wish we could have found more interesting adult things. The food court situation was not good.",
          "This review is probably a drop in the ocean considering the volume of positive ones. I'm sitting in the lineup for the Tram Ride while writing this, after little guidance from staff and having to throw elbows to get to the entrance. After \u2026",
          "The space center itself is great!  Tons to do, see, learn about, etc.  The organization of their tram system is a huge disappointment.  It has several staging area where you have to get off one to get on the next, so this creates a couple \u2026",
          "Awesome exhibits! Lines were not long at all. It probably helped we went New Year's Day. Helpful staff! Great information and history!",
          "Went with a large family group. Fun for all ages. Food is extremely overpriced. It's amazing how many little exhibits there are to see and things to learn",
          "We loved our visit! Amazing pieces of American history on display. Highlights included boarding the space shuttle Independence and the plane that carried her. My kids loved touching both a moon rock and a rock from Mars. Nice displays and hands in activities.",
          "I'm not a kid, nor do I have kids, but this is the coolest museum I've ever been to. If I lived closer in would definitely be a member, their Christmas light display is spectacular in the holiday season, and their exhibits are all really cool. Top notch museum, 5 stars.",
          "Amazing experience.  Very well managed. If you want to cover everything at space center,  start early. Tram ride tour should be done first. Also I would recommend buying membership pass to skip long queues. \nLimited food options for vegetarian (You can try impossible burger)",
          "Fascinating and interesting. I learned a great deal about America's plans in the space program as they relate to astronauts living on the international space station longer than six month, the planned journey to Mars sometimes in the 2020's \u2026",
          "It was a good experience to visit. Very cool that we were able to take a tour of the command center grounds. But I feel like the cost of $30 per person to get in is a little steep.",
          "I am in awe with how much I learned from my 3 hours at this space center. Sometimes I still spout fun facts and impress my friends or acquaintances. Lots of walking and lots of lines, I recommend going when it first opens.",
          "We love to take visitors there. We have a new experience every time we go, and we go several times a year.",
          "Other than a lot of the younger children's interactive area being out of order, we were very happy with our visit. Lots to do and see. Saturn V was amazing and awesome to behold. Such history! Definitely take the time for the tram to Rocket \u2026",
          "What's there to say? If you're a space nerd, this is the place. I live close by and visit at least once a year. They always have something different going on.",
          "Houston summers are hot, and this is a great place to spend some time in the indoors while still having an educational experience. Definitely have to get there early for the tram tickets, which is worth the experience but I would opt for as early in the day as you can.",
          "Went for Galaxy lights wasn't as impressed as I expected it is the first year so hopefully they will add some lights and more attractions that are included in the price. The VR attraction was 8 bucks each adds up when you have 5 kids. We had a good time but won't be back.",
          "Who doesn't love space? Large space center laid out like a college campus. Two hour plus tram tours, many large static displays, large theater, plenty of walk around displays and information for even the most curious and ardent fan. Great \u2026",
          "It should go without saying that this is the place you want to visit if you or the youngsters are fans of science, technology, aerospace, NASA and so on. A slew of fantastic exhibits here, not the least of which is a full-scale Shuttle, one \u2026",
          "Houston mission control tram tour was great, liked it alot. Space center was laid out well, easy to find, informative, fun for adults and families too. Definitely a must see while in Houston.",
          "A \"Must visit\"! If you think 'it's not rocket science'....come here and see...'It Is!'\nAt times you wonder if it's we humans who have created this...it's that awesome!\nAlso makes you think surreally, why would one harm another life, when you can channelize your energies to achieve something like this!",
          "Really amazing, but please make sure you don't miss the train tour which takes you to a mission control centre, astronaut testing centre and a real space ship.",
          "Great learning experience for kids . Family can spend 3-4 hours in the space center. There are always some activities, live demos for kids .The tram tour will consume  most of your time. There are three different tours . And we were advised \u2026",
          "85 bucks to see some history. I am a space and aviation buff. Too much",
          "Awesome place! Able to tour the space shuttle! One note- we missed to bus to the control centre. Not clearly noted on the time of bus service. Highly recommended",
          "A fantastic museum about the American space program. The tour of Johnson Space Center was fun and interesting, and I had a great time seeing the past and future of manned space flight.",
          "You will spend pretty much your whole time standing in line. They addmit more people than they can comfortably accommodate. Sad and amateur for NASA reputation.Staff just turn their cold shoulders on you.",
          "Excellent excellent excellent.. it is a great experience.. well managed tours.. very knowledgeable and one of a kind experience.. a must visit for sure",
          "loved it. You can literally learn everything about history of space, NASA missions and future explorations. Awesome. So much science, exhibits and information. You will need at least full day there. Also good food at the cafeteria.",
          "I love this place -but I am a Space nut - so it may not be for you.  It is quite nice - lots of exhibits - nice tour of the facilities - make sure you do the tour of the Apollo 11 lunar mission control room - they have set it back to just the way it was in 1969 and do a nice multimedia presentation",
          "Way too many classrooms of rowdy kids ruined the experience for my family. I understand they're children and it's part of their curriculum but wish there was a family day or something advertised to plan our trip better. The experience itself was good but a bit expensive.",
          "On our visit the site was quite quiet so we didn't experience any problems parking or any queues for the entrance or tram tour. The exhibition centre itself is large, with a lot of different exhibits, many of which are interactive. It would \u2026",
          "Going to Space Center gives you an interesting peek into the space program. While the exhibits in the main hall are informative, the highlight for us was taking the tram tour around the campus to see where NASA gets work done. We spent 5 \u2026",
          "Amazing, it was far better than I had expected! Take the tram tour, you will not be disappointed. The simulator and VR experience was also great. Really good value for money. The only disappointment was the service at the food area was not good and our food was cold.",
          "Excellent tourist attraction. Good collection of space artifacts from NASA program displayed. Lot of educational and entertainment shows for kids and adults. Very lovely place",
          "Can't wait to do level 9 tour. Amazing place. Interesting and educational \u2665\ufe0f",
          "The place is interesting and informative. It's always packed with tourist and locals and visitors. I just had a bad experience today with one of it's employees when we're trying to take a photo right in front of space shuttle Independence \u2026",
          "Excellent place to consider visiting if you are visiting Houston. There is something for everyone in your family to enjoy, from young to \u201cseasoned\u201d if you have an interest in Space, NASA, rocks, rockets ships! If you have a CityPass, this \u2026",
          "Plenty of informative displays from the start of the space program to future missions; Orion spacecraft. Tram tour of astronaut training simulator, Saturn moon launch vehicle.  Catch a live astronaut 30 min. lecture.  Gift shops. Food court.  Our tour skipped Mission Control; thus 4 stars.",
          "This is a very nice place to go for a day out and spend time with your family. The campus is really huge,  really amazing, great to know about things of space, fun-filled tram tour, a great learning experience! There are two gift shops inside and a cafeteria. I really had fun time!",
          "It is an amazing place here and I am so glad to visit here. We learn about NASA and the Apollo history. See the real rocket and space shuttle, that is really neat and awesome!!",
          "With myself being slightly older than NASA, this has always been a \"have to see\" destination. It did not disappoint. With what seemed like hundreds of displays, a multitude of interactive activities and some amazing presentations in the \u2026",
          "Very interesting museum. Came during the off season so we were able to take our time and experience every single exhibit in 5 hours.",
          "This place is a must if you ever go to Houston, full of amazing stories and the best is that everything is real. You get to see aircrafts, rockets and gadgets which are wonderful.",
          "I really enjoyed the amount of things to do here. I would recommend taking the astronaut training facility tour since it was the coolest if you enjoy this kind of stuff or even if you don't.",
          "Please urge other patrons to visit during weekdays. I'll be sure to follow my own advice in the future.\n\nThis museum isn't simply about making money, it seems to care about preserving American culture and scientific innovation before \u2026",
          "Wonderful exhibit to go through. If you are like me though you will need a couple trips through, or a FULL day, to see everything. We like to look and read everything there. In around 4 hours we saw maybe a quarter to a third of the stuff, \u2026",
          "It was an expensive in price but cheap in performance. There was barely anything intellectually challenging in films, museum exhibition, and science exploration tools. Is this museum for children? \nWe were distasted by the tricks the center used to sell snacks etc. It all could have been mush much better?\nIs this museum for profit?..",
          "Going to the Johnson Space Center for me personally was a trip of a lifetime the exhibits were absolutely outstanding some of them were interactive and some of them were so mean that you would just observe that a beautiful theater great \u2026",
          "Felt like it was stuck in another decade. With all the new developments and things we've learned about space, it felt lacking. The tram tour was neat, but not worth the 2 hour wait that built up shortly after opening. If you're in the \u2026",
          "Fascinating place for space enthusiasts.  Great to get kids interested in a major human accomplishment.",
          "Went to epicurian night. Was amazing. Food from all over. Silent auction. They did it right and am looking for future events there.",
          "Awesome place to visit and a good fun for kids. Very informative and goosebumps guaranteed..",
          "Loved this place. We  enjoyed the experience.  Very clean, and knowledgeable. Really wonderful experience.",
          "A great museum of the history of space exploration. Make sure you spend enough time to do all the exterior visits (control center, astronaut training etc)",
          "Great place. Can spend whole day in here. They preserved a lot of history in here so that the current and future generations can see and feel what the human race achieved.",
          "Fantastic space and science center and museum. Well worth the admission and be sure to allot an entire day to really appreciate the experience.  An absolute must see for anyone in the Houston area.",
          "Would love to find a time when it's not so crowded. Tram lines were about an hour long. The theatres were good. Food court was amusement park pricing. Bought tickets online through a Groupon for a bit of savings.",
          "Impressive from the outside. Unfortunately they were closing an hour earlier than the website suggested, and we were not granted access. We drove from Oklahoma City, and I had a car full of disappointed people. Getting the hours of operation on the website right is not rocket science.",
          "Great exhibits including some of original space artifacts including a Mercury capsule. Seeing the vehicles launched into space so many years ago should really make you think about those men. They had no guarantees if safety or success; very \u2026",
          "Awsome place for any age!!! Lots of historical value with Apollo operations but does have lot of unique experience like astronaut training tram tour which was fabulous. Lots of informative sessions from space center operations to YTD NASA operations. Worth visiting for a lifetime!!!",
          "Feed your inner geek!  This is a large facility with plenty to do for the whole family.  From small learning exercises for children to examples of technology used for space exploration and study, all the way to multiple tours of real, \u2026",
          "I've been wanting to go here for years. It was everything I could have imagined and more. Seeing Mission Control was really cool.",
          "Amazing place and friendly staff (except the photo people. They are rude if you don't buy a package )",
          "Awesome and really amazing achievements by man kind. I never could've imagined how complex and technologically deep, this industry has gone. When you add to that the place in time when those first took place, it brings you to realize the \u2026",
          "Get there early!!! Preferably by 10 am to finish the museum part and then head to the tram that takes you to the control center which shouldn\u2019t be missed at any cost. Great experience but we( group of 3 friends) went late during holiday \u2026",
          "I could personally feel space center Florida is much better than Houston. The tour is much better there.",
          "Loved every minute of this visit. So much to see, definitely recommend you take the tram to JSC and plan to spend the day there",
          "A ton of fun! Wish I could have spent more time here.  Lots of really neat things to see",
          "A great place with so much modern history.  We arrived at 10:00 straight onto the first tram for the mission control tour, we then jumped onto the second tram for the space training center, also stopping at Rocket Park to see the amazing \u2026",
          "A very coveted tourists attraction in Houston! Make sure you arrive before 11 am for parking and tram tour! Plan on spending 4 to 6 hours here so come prepared especially if you have kids. There is restuarant in the facility but it's \u2026",
          "It has always been my dream to come here and it was incredible as expected. the mission control center tour was surreal",
          "Very expensive for what it is. Worth a visit, but not ant extras. Best to go in the off-season mid-week. The tram ride was informative & interesting. \nThe location is hard to get to if you don't have a car & the tour option severely limits your time at the centre.",
          "Very cool, but could use a mit more organization.  We started in kids area which had lots of hands on exhibits but many were broken. Then we headed to the center and looked around.. we should have gone through the freedom plaza exhibit first, that's where you get to see ALL the cool things!!",
          "It was super awesome. Came here a day before Thanksgiving to see the light show. The kids loved it and we had a really good time.",
          "Nice experience. Make sure you take the Tram Tour.\nYou can spend many hours here.",
          "Educational with a lot of things to see. They have many kid oriented areas for children to learn and two different gift shops with a lot of items. They also have some simulations that can be ridden for between $6-10 per session. They have \u2026",
          "Great experience, just advice you to not go on weekends. It will be real busy and you won't get the same experience. I went on a Wednesday i believe, and it was fantastic",
          "Really.loved the Galaxy.Lights!  Very inventive light displays like you've not.seen before, very unique!   The projections on the Saturn V rocket were fantastic!!",
          "We had a great time at the Space Center on 12/7/19.  There are many fun and interactive activities and I recommend a full day to get everything in!  Enjoy!",
          "It was a great place to visit to explore the planet. Along Rocket ship, Apollo missions, Astronauts and Space Shuttle. The galaxy lights are very amazing. Awesome Tour!\ud83d\ude42",
          "i love space center houston! so much fun. the rockets are so cool to look at and the exhibits are always cool. definitely come here if you\u2019re in the area with kids!",
          "What a great experience! Allow plenty of time to take in all the exhibits and the trams, too. We learned so much!",
          "Perfect spot for the kids for the day. Lots to do and see\n A great gift shop and friendly staff.",
          "First time being and I gotta say I was kinda bored and might have been expecting too much. The tour guide was very passionate and know his stuff and was entertaining but the actual tour itself was just boring :/",
          "This place is lovely as can be! I've been here since I was a child and it just gets better better.",
          "Used coupon @ visitors center saved $10, less crowd on Sunday, always super fun and stuff to do all day",
          "Great place for kids. Adults will not feel time passing too. Very well done: entertaining and educating. There is a Lot to discover, be prepared to walk a lot and It's a full day excursion. Some exibits are outside the main facility and \u2026",
          "It was really nice, but unfortunate for us it was so heavily crowded and the staffs could have done better to handle the crowd. Need more to time to see everything and take every tour. Will definitely plan for another visit during non-peak hours.",
          "Feeling proud and patriotic, amazed, and like a little kid.  Ride the two trams to experience history.  Best to come when it opens to get the free mission control tram ride ticket.  By 12 noon, all tickets are gone. Make sure to check out \u2026",
          "Had a ton of fun BUT 4 stars because the person taking admission stole our credit card number.  He was caught after using it. So we will only use cash if we go back",
          "It was so much fun. Space Lights is definitely something we recommend. Our little one and the teenagers loved it.",
          "Space lover's galore! You'll love this place but make sure you come on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday due to business.",
          "Seeing the recently renovated Apolo Mission Control was awesome and amazing. Seeing the Saturn V was great. Everything else was so-so at best. If it weren't for the 2 things I mentioned, it would have been a waste of time and money. Touring the mission control was worth the admission.",
          "This place is very educational. A place that if you have children is a must take then. It is a little expensive but over all worth it.",
          "Must see for space history enthusiasts... Take the tram ride to the Orion control center and the astronaut training center followed by the main space center which had a lot of educational attractions... gift shop is overpriced but good to \u2026",
          "Went their for an educational course. It was very informative and the staff, especially Natalee was very helpful throughout the course. It was an amazing 2 weeks experience.",
          "Wow, lots of information and history is here and while we were there for about 4 hours, we didn't get to see everything as the place is huge and spread out.  So if you have never been, make sure that you give yourself the full day.  My wife \u2026",
          "Nice place for all ages. They have plenty of restaurants, and hands on activities. Clean restrooms and very helpful staff. Very organized when busy.",
          "Easy to understand displays. Spacious and thus easier to get around and get closer to exhibits.",
          "Space Center Houston was a very interesting place to visit, with tons of information. A proper visit would probably take the whole day, with everything to see and do. This place is an amazing museum, displaying all the greatness that NASA \u2026",
          "It's an experience you'll remember forever.\n\nThey have the only preserved Saturn V, and even let you enter in a space shuttle mounted on top of a 747 (you can enter in the 747 too).\n\nAmazing.",
          "Loved the place. It was fascinating and one of a kind. The staff were pleasant, of courtesy and professional. The ISS show was awesome, and moreover full of humor and amusement.\nThe tram tour was amazing too, and full of informative stops; though we ended up in rain poring and thunder",
          "Amazing + Awesome!!! The coordination could be better during peak hours. The content and displays are fantastic.",
          "A really great experience for the entire family and I think reasonably priced. I only gave 4 stars since I think the tram rides could be much better organized. It is not fun to stand in 102 heat and wait 40 Minutes to get on a tram I \u2026",
          "Magical Christmas decorations. Very interesting museum, colorful exhibits and science displays. Kids will love the walk throughs of capsules and fuselages.",
          "Was really excited for NASA but was really disappointed because I spent an hour to line up for the tours. Do your research before you come to NASA, try your best not to come during crowded days.",
          "I love Space Center Houston. Ive been a million times since i was a kid and I will never get tired of it. You can literally stand in the REAL mission control and see it first hand. Incredible.",
          "Fantastic trip. And the Level 9 tour was excellent, and well worth the extra money for the deeper look at the Space Center. Our guide David made it an excellent day.",
          "Great place for those who have an interest in science or space and there are places that can be good and fun for children also i saw the Saturn 5",
          "It's okay. I just expected a lot more for what I always hear about it. The lines were unreasonably long and many of the things for kids to learn on were broken. Wasted day and wasted money. Very disappointing. I should have just watched Netflix, Youtube or Googled some space stuff.",
          "Quite interesting, but not enough to keep you there beyond a couple of hours unless you are really interested in NASA and space exploration",
          "Awesome place! The tour guide was very knowledgeable n helpful answering questions.",
          "Spent 4.5 hours exploring all the exhibits and tours. Incredible experience and good food too.",
          "I expected more after visiting Kennedy Space Center. Houston's facility is not very well organized and even though it has some really awesome artifacts of space exploration, you barely get a chance to enjoy them due to crowds or bad tour planning.\nTheir setup for Christmas lights was looking really weak too.",
          "Really cool exhibits did think it could be a bit more technologically advanced since it is nasa",
          "An awesome place to explore and know about Geography and space shuttles. Place is well maintained with a good customer service and guides",
          "Great insights into the past and future of NASA.  Really liked seeing the 747 that used to carry all the shuttles.  Don\u2019t miss the Apollo Mission Control tour.",
          "Must see no matter what age. It's educational, exciting and so much fun. $5 to park. $30 entrance (for an adult). Take the time out cuz they have exhibits, shows, meet n' greets, tram rides, and a bunch of stuff to wonder around looking at. It really is a great place.",
          "Everything was great. The lecture from a real astronaut was a real treat. Awesome seeing the control room and rocket park. Even the food at the food court was good.",
          "A must visit if you like space.  Great exhibit, fun for all ages.  Be prepared to wait in line during peak times.",
          "Nice attraction in the local area. I felt that Kennedy space center was better and had more to offer.",
          "The fee to enter is high and the food is overpriced. The tour to ser the Saturn V rocket is great, but otherwise we were ready to leave after an hour or so. Plan to spend a lot of money.",
          "There is so much to see, and all is so beautifully organized. There is plenty for all age levels. I have visited several times and each time I find myself delighted at the exhibits and learn something new. I end up losing track of time!",
          "Had fun! 1st time to visit and I had live in Houston since \u201888. It was a neat experience",
          "Great experience! If it's cool out, don't forget to bring a jacket for the tram rides.",
          "A must see if you visit Houston. Museum is trully awesome. Not a big fan of the attractions. If you're wanting to visit for the museum, go on an off day during the week. Can get extremely busy.",
          "Really interesting for any space buffs, but my wife likes it too. To me, an engineer, it was a thing of pride and sadness-- we did great, heroic work in the 60's but not lately. Go see it to remember; go see it to hope.",
          "I really wanted to love this, but the experience was so mind-numbing that instead of increasing my love for science I almost lost the will to live. We spent 4 hours here, for a total of about 15 minutes of experience, and I'm being generous \u2026",
          "We went to see Galaxy Lights and it was amazing! Facility was decked out! Normal indoor activities seemed to be available as well. Highly recommend it!",
          "Great experience for young people.  Go early.  The lines get long later in the day.  Disappointed that we could not experience weightlessness, so check to see if available before going.",
          "Engaging, informative, exciting! Spent 4 hours there, but still not enough. So much to experience!",
          "My first time here and it was a blast (no pun intended)! I got to see the refurbished Apollo Mission Control, a mock up of the space shuttle, and the actual 747 that transported it. There's a ton of stuff to do, and you really do need more \u2026",
          "Such a cold place to visit the space center.  The displays were awesome and very accessible as well as interactive!  This adult NERD had a blast and I can\u2019t wIt till my grandson is old enough to go!",
          "Johnson Space Center \nWhen we got there, we got to see the Shuttle piggybacked onto the 747. That was a first for me.\nWe went to the Mission Control Center tour but the next available time was 1:30. They gave us tickets to reserve the space \u2026",
          "Came with my husband and teenage daughters. Everyone had a great time! This place is fun for the whole family! Be sure to take the tram tour even if there is a long line. It's certainly worth the wait!",
          "Oh my goodness! Get in line for the tram tour right away! We were very disappointed that the line was 3+ hours to go see mission command and a lot of other awesome exhibits. We didn't actually get to go see them because of the line, but \u2026",
          "Saw the new Christmas lights installation and it was pretty awesome! Seeing the Saturn V and all the history there was breathtaking!",
          "What a great place. If you have kids this is a must. Even if you are the kid.",
          "Interesting exhibition right in the Houston NASA base, where you can see a reproduction of the International Space Station, the authentic space shuttle, the Saturn V launcher, and so on. One can as well check out the mission control rooms, \u2026",
          "Everything there is a bit stale. Gift shops are not very good. Food there is alright and the SCU program thing they have is great.",
          "Level 9 tour was great! Regular areas full of activities and cool stuff.",
          "Lots of scientific information that inspire visitors - to become astronauts. But I always keep in mind the wisdom in Eccl. 8:17 and 1Pet. 5:6, 7. Overall, a great place to see.",
          "Kind of pricey, but the exhibits are all free to get into. Loved the 747. Wish we had an actual shuttle tho. We are \"space city\"",
          "Great experience, lots of fun. A proper visit would probably take the whole day. There's the main building, and the two Tram tours. Would recommend getting in line to the tours as early as possible. At peak time there's about an hour's \u2026",
          "It's been good to go there. I was expecting a little more, though out of the museum itself. I wish the museum had more hands on stuff for kids. The best of all we're the tours to the Johnson's Space Center itself.",
          "Overall a very cool experience.  Nice to see some history and learn a little along the way.",
          "There is so much to learn and see! Plan for a whole day. There are many things for kids to experience but I honestly liked going back with just adults and my 13 year old! So amazing!",
          "Brilliant. Especially the guided tours. If you can get a space on it (see what I did there?) I really recommend the historic mission control centre tour. It's where the first moon landing was ran from. Just remember to pick up a ticket as \u2026",
          "Neat place to learn about space travel and history of the various missions. Also informative for goals and the future of NASA. Really neat to take the tours.  Mission Control was amazing.",
          "Our family had an absolutely great time! This is a great museum and so much fun learning about the Space program. A couple of the interactive exhibits were not working, which was disappointing, but the Tram tour of Mission Control (included \u2026",
          "Fascinating and memorable! So much to see and learn - well worth a day visit when in Houston.",
          "History of spaceflight all in one place. My mother installed the windows on the space shuttle and the thrusters on the Apollo capsule. Fun to see them up close.",
          "Was a good place to spend half a day. We went there during the Galaxy Lights time, but it was totally overpriced, the Galaxy Lights part, at $20. Entry for SCH itself is $30 at the counter but you can get it for cheaper at around 25 online if you search around.",
          "History and knowledge can always be awe inspiring. So much went into the physics of space travel before the advent of computer aided engineering.",
          "Neat to see. The museum itself is geared towards little kids with the grown up displays tucked in the corners. The tour is ok with some neat NASA history to see.",
          "Enjoyed this very much. Lots of things to do and see here. The price was reasonable.",
          "The biggest issue is the efficiency in which its run.  Trams for the tours are ridiculously slow and zero organization while operating.  Employees could honestly care less about whats going on. Obviously government run facility but it needs a serious upgrade.  Otherwise, a cool place to visit.",
          "It was a good place with scientific interactive programs and exhibits. But there was no proper guidance and map to completely enjoy the full exhibits",
          "The weakest location on the Houston City Pass for sure.. hasn't changed in any measurable way in 15 years and it shows.. good for maybe an hour unless you like to stand in long lines for tram tours which is the only real option for entertainment at SCH.. either way expect bored and angry children and/or parents/ entire family.",
          "There's a lot exhibits to look at, if your into space and in Houston try and schedule a day here you won't regret it! From a 747 conversion with a space shuttle on top of it, to seeing an actual Saturn V rocket on its side in the rocket \u2026",
          "Great day very informative about history of when the USA had a goal to go to the noon.",
          "Amazing! Everyone should visit and learn more about space; and how trying to reach the heavens has changed and influenced our day-to-day lives!",
          "I was so curious to visit this place. It was best dream which got completed. I enjoyed the visit. Got to see various astronomy adventures. It was amazing to remember KC. \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73",
          "This place was very cool and inspiring to visit!",
          "Fun and interactive attraction, but might need to look into sides for the tram for heavy rain as we all got extremely wet, it was still a lot of fun though and didn\u2019t dampen our spirits in the slightest. Would highly recommend to people of all ages visiting the Houston region.",
          "We've been going here for years.  We love all of the new attractions and how they rotate in new stuff inside.  We always take friends and family from out of town.  Go, you won't be disappointed!",
          "Absolutely amazing for space fanatics and beginners alike, you can end up spending your whole day here and still feel like you would've liked more time. Even so, their displays are super interactive and they have tons of fun presentations. \u2026",
          "Very cool place to see and learn. Kids had fun doing the interactive stations.  We went dueing apring breal so the lines to try out the stations were a little long but expected. The splace was clean and the displays were interesting.",
          "Amazing place! Well worth taking the time to spend half the day and take in all of the information and activities. It's easy to find and to get around. There are two tram tours of about 45 minutes, a 15 minutes movie and plenty of other things to see.",
          "Amazing. So much to see and do.  I highly recommend the tram tours.",
          "Staff is friendly and knowledgeable, don't be afraid to ask questions. Could literally spend all day easily there.",
          "Amazing!!! Great place for kids and adults.  Learning and fun rolled in one",
          "This place is often crowded, but it's a blast to go to whether you have kids or not. They just added the replica of the Space Shuttle on the carrier jet, and their main exhibits are geared towards the SLS now. However you feel about the SLS Program or Gateway, Space Center Houston is still a fun place to go to!",
          "If you are fascinating by space travel this is a must see! Be sure to reserve a free ticket for the Apollo Mission Control team tour when you get there. Guest services will show you how. You get to go inside a real space shuttle!",
          "Great place to learn about space and have fun at the same time, would definitely go again",
          "The tours are definitely worth the wait if you're wanting to go on them. If it rains and there is lightning nearby they will have to cut the tour short for the safety of the group, so plan accordingly! There's always tons of fun and interactive things to do here!",
          "Some cool stuff and a lot of interaction opportunities but poorly set up and limited information about things.  Tour tithe Apollo mission control not worth the wait.",
          "don't make the same mistake as me...... don't think you can do this in half a day..... you can't.  it was my last day in Houston evening flight so thought oh it will be fine...... I would go back in a heart beat there is so much I didn't see and do.",
          "Pretty cool venue and a can't-miss if you're a space fan. Very interesting to see the replicas of the shuttles and other spacecrafts. Some of the games are a bit outdated, but it adds to the mystique of the space travel era in my opinion. It's pretty dark inside, so be careful if you have small children.",
          "It's okay. Probably more for kids than adults. Good tram tour.",
          "Love it. Have lived in Baytown all my life and never came here. Granddaughter here with family for Thanksgiving and wanted to come so we did. Very interesting and informative.",
          "The main area was a little too kid oriented.  I hoped to see more artifacts from space exploration but there was more things for kids to do and play with.\n\nTook a couple of hours to figure out the the best parts were on the tram tours. \u2026",
          "The content of this place is pretty good, but there is a bit of broken interactive activities. Plus, the astronaut training tour was pretty lit. I recommend it.\nIf you want to go on a tram, you gotta wait in line. That's why I rate this a 3 \u2026",
          "This place is awesome.  Lots to see and lots of  learning with the history here.",
          "So much to see and learn.  My kids loved it.",
          "JSC is amazing. A small behind the senses look at what NASA does everyday.",
          "Took kids to this place & we really enjoyed it. Very educational & fun!!!",
          "Awesome. If you can get season passes it is more than worth it to bypass the lines. It was crowded but that's expected. It's great to go back in time and see some of the pivotal moments in the space program and human history. I highly \u2026",
          "I tool the car, about an hour. Wasnt as fun as I expected, I couldn't hear anything the guide was saying over the loud engine (I was in the front). The destinations the guide didn't say much about the rockets. The rockets were cool though, reeaaaly big. There is also a museum, on the international space station, space suits etc.",
          "Awesome place... I was over the moon when I visited it and touched the Moon and Mars stones... TRAM tour is must...",
          "Lots to see and do! Spent 4 hours there watching the films and seeing all the exhibits. Well done NASA, well done!",
          "We've come here three times in three years and have discovered something new each time. The center takes the time to update some exhibits and the tours. Staff is knowledgeable and happy to talk space.",
          "Seeing the history of the space program, especially the early years is inspiring. While not progressing as quickly as I'd like, the current projects give hope for the future.",
          "Amazing!!! Never been and it was really cool to learn about space. They gave interactive games you can play. You can learn about how life is like on the international space station and what they do up there. You can learn about the history \u2026",
          "Very interesting place to visit. A lot of information. Not for little kids as the entertainment is not engaging for young ones (toddlers). I definitely recommended it for adults. The most impressive was the space craft and the plane carrier.",
          "We really enjoyed our second visit to JSC. The exhibits had changed since our last visit to reflect the mission to Mars.",
          "What an amazing place. Hearing the guide talk about the flight control room going to be used for Artemis and future Mars program is extremely l incredibly inspiring.",
          "An amazing day out with lots to see and do. The tours are fully recommended.\n\nThere is plenty of food options.\n\nIt is very interesting to see and fully recommended. It is a whole day so get there early.\n\nIn February there was not many queues and the temperature was good, I suspect it will get hot in the summer.",
          "Interesting place to take family kids. I've always been a big space buff so this place was must see. I would absolutely recommend taking the free tour around the facility. It's about an hour and a half and you are taken to a few facilities \u2026",
          "Awesome experience! Educational and engaging. Lots of cool space history to see and learn about.",
          "Attended a week long masterclass and will never forget it! Very fun and interesting!",
          "Amazing place to take your family. Highly recommended.",
          "Cool place to visit and see a working station in action. Great day out",
          "My 4 year old attended 2 of their day camps, and both times requested that we leave him there for 2 weeks.  The staff seemed really nice and he only had great things to say about his day.",
          "Get there early as it gets pretty packed, great place for the whole family to visit.",
          "If your interested in \"Space\" this place will blow your mind. Each direction you turn / go will amaze you. Walking out after hrs of \"Space Exploration\" you realize how far we as a civilization have come. Well worth going to.\n10 stars.",
          "It was wonderful. The staff was informative and pleasant. The attractions were fun and the lights for Galaxy Lights were awesome.",
          "Is it busy? Don't go in. So you want to spend three and half hours in line to see one rocket? Then go. If you get there at two and they close at five you will find that most of the place closes at three. Whoops. No refunds.  We spent all satirday to wait hours in line for a tram and a thirty miutes in line for a bathroom.",
          "Plan a whole day to check out all the Space Center has to offer. So neat to see a Saturn V Rocket up close. Decent food selection in the cafe. Stadium prices, but better than some. Bring your water bottle to fill so you stay hydrated not \u2026",
          "Perhaps I just came on an exceptionally busy day, but it was so crowded that my kids couldn't really see or do anything. the line for the tram wrapped around the inside of of the building 1 1/2 times. The only staff I could find for help \u2026",
          "maybe I expected too much.  or with normal tickets you don\u2019t see everything.  the visit to the Saturn V rocket and the flight in the fighter jet simulator were definitely interesting.",
          "Exactly what I expected! Coming to the Houston centre has really increased my interest on the topic of space! What an incredible thing!! :)",
          "Great museum! We almost spend the whole day without getting bored",
          "Beautiful place for STEM. We've been coming here since 2013. I love the membership benefits.",
          "Must see.  When people come together, great things gets created..",
          "It\u2019s a good place to visit but not a great place. There are other places to visit in America that are stunning... like the flight museum in Seattle etc.\nI wish this place had a planetarium and a science museum rolled into one... but not... just empty painted tubes. I was expecting so much more. Ces la vie!",
          "Many attractions with alot of hands on activities for all ages. It can get very busy so I recommend going early.",
          "Went here for the 50 year celebration of the first lunar landing. Generally speaking the organization was great and the value which included tram tours and the concert was well worth it. This a cool and informative place to visit in \u2026",
          "Great for the \"Astronaut\" in you! Tons of exhibits with daily schedule for \"Ask the Astronaut \"; several times a day.  Plentiful parking, and a \" Kodak Moment \" as you pull in, as well as after you park your vehicle. Food prices are a bit high, however,  within normal tolerances as compared with other themed attractions.",
          "Great place to spend a day. So much to do and see. Awesome tour guides.",
          "The trip was well worth it so many things to learn about very educational. I would recommend it for anybody it's fun for kids too.",
          "The admission price was high for the small amount of exhibits in comparison to other big city museums.   Everything was cramped into a rather small floorplan. I wanted to love it after buying the membership but we likely won't return for a \u2026",
          "Very nice I had allot of fun..ask for wheel chairs if u have a relative that cannot walk a lot or be standing for long period of time they given to you.",
          "Awesome place and a must see especially for kids... Staff over here needs a bit of training in managing visiting crowds.. they are all young and a little clueless on how to deal with holiday weekend size crowds.. we were told that the Orion \u2026",
          "Texas visitors must visit once. Informative. Well maintained.",
          "We attended Epicurean Evening at Space Center Houston and had a great night sampling food from a huge amount of local vendors.",
          "Extraordinary - Space Shuttle on the Jumbi Jet and so much real Space Stuff to see! Really amazing and titally worrh to see!",
          "My kids loved it it's a wonderful place educational there's nothing to say more",
          "We spent the entire day bobbing round this place. Loved it but take a bit of advice get the team tours done first. One is a timed tour the other runs roughly every 20-30 mins. Also bring some snacks and drinks as food here is on the pricey side. Loads of stuff for the kids to get into and play with make this a real family day out.",
          "Amazing i love it. have to see. tnx",
          "Too commercial. Entrance ticket price is low, but almost everything inside costs extra. I was waiting in my wheelchair for the tour. They noticed me, but left without me. No idea why. At least explain. I can't walk, but can think & feel ;-)",
          "We had a great time here and the kids loved it. I saw complaints about the wait times for the trams. The trick is to get a ticket for the tram with a reserved time when you arrive. \n\nMy only complaint was the food at the Cafeteria was outrageously expensive.",
          "An amazing treasure trove of information, artifacts, and activities related to U.S. space travel. Ever touched a rock from outer space, been in a space module, seen a Space Shuttle? At the Space Center you can!",
          "Is really nice, something different. Theres more in live that disneyland.",
          "Can I live here? This place will take you out of this world. Love it and don't forget to take the tour.",
          "It was an amazing experience but they dont give you maps and listings of the theater times. You have to wait at least an hour to do the tram tour. You have to wait about 40 minutes to do the virtual reality ride. It's like they're not organized.  Why make people wait? The times to wait in line are ridiculous.",
          "Great historical displays. Ok food but expensive. Great tour guides.",
          "A fantastic place for young and old to visit and be amazed.\n\nCome early and as soon as you get in, get tickets for the Apollo Tour. If you are on the first two sessions, the line is not long but any later than that, you'll be waiting in line for a while.",
          "Great experience! Take the ride to Mission Control & re-live the first moon landing! Amazing! Take your kids and spend the day learning in an interactive environment while having fun. Or go alone like I did and nerd out unapologetically.",
          "Visited this time for the Galaxy lights display that's going to run until at least first week of Jan 2020 I believe. Had a chill, relaxed time and geeked out hard. Kids would definitely enjoy",
          "First visit!! Very impressed!! Toured mission control, Science building and Saturn IV!!!! Saturn IV visit was not near long enough!!! Still give 5 stars even though the Saturn IV tour was rushed.",
          "Amazing museum dedicated to the rich history and future of America's space exploration.\n\nPhotos from tram tour, which I highly recommend!",
          "A LOT more fun than I thought it would be! I highly recommend taking the tram tours (they last about an hour) as they take you around the facility and the tour guide gives you some fun facts as well as explaining everything you're seeing. \u2026",
          "I attended the Christmas light show which was good...the ride to the rocket was pretty cool...the lights were beautiful.bGot to see some cool bouncing light ball and a small your of the space suits.The 3D reality was cool and there were two other rides.The store is amazing for what it has.",
          "Love this place!  I purchased  the family  plan as you cannot  see it all in one visit.  Great  for children  and adults.  Have been twice  and going again.  Members  get great  perks.",
          "Really nice and educational place, try to go early to enjoy all the attractions.",
          "Very informative and fun! Plus the staff are so polite and helpful.",
          "Very well arranged and educative exhibits. Shows are great and if you are lucky you can meet an astronaut and listen from them about their experiences.\nWe got to see one of the rockets Saturn V with all the F1 engines. Seeing them in real \u2026",
          "First time to visit and loved all of the tours,displays, facts,and physical things we were able to do.   Learned a lot about our government, astronauts, presidents, and outer space phenomenons!  Great, great, great visit!!\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Loved the exhibits! This was an amazing museum and the tour was out of this world. God to see the command center for the moon landing. Wasn't able to see the current command center, and that was the more expensive tour. \n\nEither way, the information they provide and what they have to see from missions was pretty cool.",
          "When in Houston, visit this place.  It's the thing to do.  Interesting things to see.  Totally different from the one in Florida.",
          "Great place for kids and adults alike!!   Had lunch with an astronaut (reservations required) and did the tram tour.",
          "If you are in the Houston area (aka Space City) you have to make time to check out the space center. Kids or no kids it's a great opportunity to learn more about the U.S. space program, and to see just how truly massive some of the space vehicles really are.",
          "So cool! We spent hours here and could have spent more! The tours were great. Was so cool seeing so much history in person, as well as some of what NASA is doing now. The facility was great for kids and adults alike.",
          "Just went there to work. The Christmas lights they had out were really nice. You really need to check it out around the Holidays.",
          "This place is amazing. Arrived early and saw a lot in 6 hours. The trams were not crowded, as previous posters had stated, maybe the overcast weather and threat of rain kept most away. The tour operators were speaking English but heavily \u2026",
          "Enjoyed the Christmas lights at Space Center Houston.  We may not go every year but you should see it at least once.",
          "Interesting place to visit, but needs a lot time to see all attractions.",
          "A wonderful mix of history and engineering! The tour of the Johnston NASA Space Center is quite the eye opener.",
          "Amazing!!!!! A must when in Houston. You get to walk inside the space shuttle and that alone is worth the trip. They took us on a tour of the buildings and explain how the astronauts train.  It's pretty incredible!!!",
          "Space center Houston combines great history with current events. You can see a Saturn Five (humongous rocket), Skylab, and space suits from the dawn on the space age until now, but you can also see the Space vehicle mockup facility that has training/engineering models that are actually being used to solve new problems!",
          "Historically significant place.  Not cheap.  The main room is designed for kids with lost of interactive science stuff, can be pretty darn crowded and noisy.  The Space shuttle exhibit is great and educational.  The Saturn Rocket exhibit is \u2026",
          "Loved it. Awesome experience. Very educational",
          "I came here back in the mid 90's, so much has changed. My family & I are enjoying it all over again",
          "Definitely a place to go and visit. Very informative and a good time. Too many kids just running around and getting in the way when you're trying to read the plaques is the only downside. But nonetheless quite a great way to shave off a few hours in the day. Live science experiments are carried out by the staff so that's good.",
          "I really hated my experience for one major reason. Lines! The lines were so long!!! Out of the 5 hours I was there 4 of the hours we were  spent waiting in line for the tours. No joke, this is the wrap around line to get on the train. \u2026",
          "Amazing educational experience and also I fount out so many more things about our space programs in a fun way",
          "The exhibits in the main hall are informative. There are several theaters. There is also a team ride to the old restored Apollo mission control viewing room. There\u2019s a bit for everyone from children to adults. The simulator and VR experience was also great. The only disappointment was the service at the food area was not good.",
          "I recognized the reason why the U.S is the greatest country in the world after visiting this place. Once Americans make a road, the Rest of the world follows the road.",
          "Educational, good staff, a little bit of fun thrown in. Definitely recommend visiting if you're in houston, but reserve like 2 hours at minimum as the team tour is an hour and a half.",
          "Simply great place for visit & observe / understand various space related information &  programs with help of exhibits. It\u2019s nice place to spend day. All facilities like food court, accessibility to all & gift store are available. Visit to \u2026",
          "fun experience but a bit disappointing at some of the broken activities/ displays. also thought there would be more to see there. wish there was another floor and more information available. the mission control room was a plus and really cool to see. wish there were more functional interactive activities",
          "Houston. .... We don't have any problems. Five hours of space awesome.",
          "Great learning experience for all ages. Amazing",
          "Always fun and educational. Now that we have celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 1st moon landing, there is continued interest in the further plans that NASA has for Moon and Mars exploration. Also, must take tram tour. Control room viewing and the Saturn V rocket system displayed.",
          "Love the space center - but don't go in raining season.",
          "Loved the place, worth every penny. There was one drawback,\nWE visited during school vacay and on a Saturday. Place was crowded, lines waiting to get on tram and back 11/2 hour wait, otherwise, all good. Educational\nWell set up. Loved the \u2026",
          "Amazing.. made me proud of what US accomplished \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Amazing selection of artifacts and photos. Also loved the simulated jet aircraft flight and meeting with the first female astronaut. Probably the best part was touching a rock from the moon. However the information is too technical for most visitors. It would have been helpful if the information were written in more layman's language.",
          "There is so much to do here that you need to reserve a full day to see it all! Activities for adults and children! Everything is interactive so it keeps the kiddos happy. The coolest part is walking through a replica of the living quarters \u2026",
          "Nice museum had a lot of stuff to entertain guest and staff was polite and willing to answer all your questions",
          "Really fun Museum with a lot to see and Hands-On stuff",
          "My son loves space center. We recently tried one of the day camps and he had the best time learning about rockets. He cannot wait to go back.",
          "So cool visiting NASA in my holidays. You can see an actual Rocket and some of the buildings inside while they are working.",
          "This is an important piece of Human history.\nLive visiting here, prices a little high but totally worth it to support preserving this important piece of our history. This is also a big part of our future because if it's inspiring future generations to go to space.",
          "I did expect it to be bigger with more activities, but over all the kids enjoyed it",
          "Cool to see space shuttles but everything else is pretty much empty",
          "Amazing museum full of interesting facts. My partner and I took the tram tour to Mission Control, the training facility, and Rocket Park. This place is fun for adults and/or children!",
          "$25 per person. Always educational and informative. Need more bench for exhibit halls.",
          "Great time..need to go back to see the stuff I missed.  The Saturn 5 Rocket  was a sight to see.",
          "Mildly entertaining. More of a one time experience",
          "While very \"touristy\", this is the Johnson Space Center. It's a little expensive, you might save some money getting a 1 year membership. If you're a space nerd you will certainly find something cool here.",
          "Amazing historical museum depicting the greatness of American space race and the human kind as a whole. Great place to learn a lot about space, rockets, & satellites. Knowledgeable guides and places. I think that it takes atleast 3 to 4 hours to cover this places in detail. So plan your trip to space center accordingly.",
          "From touching a moon rock to seeing actual Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo reentry vehicles, this is a unique experience. The Mercury suborbital launch vehicles almost look like toys, while the Saturn V rocket is mind-blowing. To top it all \u2026",
          "Has much improved over the last 10 years. Exhibit are always changing. Enjoying the speaker series on weekday night. Wish they would add a young professional membership program like the zoo, science museum, fine arts, etc. the starlight \u2026",
          "If you're in the houston area and at all interested in the history of space travel, this is a must. They offer tram rides around the actual NASA campus.",
          "Saved 5$ per ticket from my hotels brochure. Just likr everyonr says, do the tram tour and check out every single presentation, bring snacks food is a bit pricey but good quantity over all. I visited and stayed from opening time to closing time.",
          "Lot of Space History, go early and stay late. There's a lot of interesting things to see!",
          "Words cannot express how happy I am to get to see this place. A wonderful experience!",
          "Fantastic place for kids to get into STEM research and for adults to see where the future of humanity is going.",
          "Good place to visit. Astronaut training centre was disappointing. Others were very interesting.",
          "This place is just wonderful. It not only has copies of the rockets or command control center but also the real ones.\nYou learn a lot when it comes to moon travel and different attempts to go to the space as well as how the rockets have evolved since 1960's.",
          "Incredible place. Absolutely a must do at some point in ones life, I have never seen such a cool museum and being able to walk through areas where everything is to scale is incredible. I'm in my 20s and I though it was incredible, so you \u2026",
          "I\u2019m writing this review at the same time as I\u2019m writing one for the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum in Washington, DC so I guess that reflects the fact I\u2019m predisposed to be interested in this!\n\nAs a casual space nerd, this was a fascinating \u2026",
          "Attended for Galaxy Lights. It is a nice place with lots of cool things to see. I wish there had been more lights to see for Galaxy Lights though.",
          "Awesome experience. Feels like i was in the outer space",
          "So amazing to see these things up close!",
          "Using the name NASA, this small space center was over advertised, to attract visitors. The exhibition is poor. Air quality inside, restroom, and food service are also poor due overcrowded situation. $25 per ticket is over priced but is nothing compared to the time being wasted.",
          "Excellent place for space knowledge for all ages. There are activities for the young and old. Great displays and knowledgeable people to guide you."

        "wiki": "The Houston Museum of Natural Science (abbreviated as HMNS) is a natural history museum located on the northern border of Hermann Park in Houston, Texas, United States. The museum was established in 1909 by the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, an organization whose goals were to provide a free institution for the people of Houston focusing on education and science. Museum attendance totals over two million visitors each year. The museum complex consists of a central facility with four floors of natural science halls and exhibits, the Burke Baker Planetarium, the Cockrell Butterfly Center, and the Wortham Giant Screen Theatre (formerly known as the Wortham IMAX Theatre). The museum is one of the most popular in the United States and ranks just below New York City's American Museum of Natural History and Metropolitan Museum of Art and the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco in most attendance amongst non-Smithsonian museums.  Much of the museum's popularity is attributed to its large number of special or guest exhibits.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe initial museum organization was called the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, Inc., and was created in 1909. The museum's primary collection was acquired between 1914 and 1930. This included the purchase of a natural-history collection assembled by Henry Philemon Attwater and a donation from collector John Milsaps, the latter of which formed the core of the museum's gem and mineral collection. First housed in Houston's city auditorium, the collection was subsequently housed in the Central Library for seven years, and then at a site in the Houston Zoo in 1929. The museum's now wide-ranging education programs began in 1947 and, in its second year, hosted 12,000 children.\n\nThe museum was officially renamed the Houston Museum of Natural Science in 1960. Construction of the current facility in Hermann Park began in 1964 and was completed in 1969.By the 1980s, the museum's permanent displays included a dinosaur exhibit, a space museum, and exhibits on geology, biology, petroleum science, technology, and geography. In 1988, the Challenger Learning Center was opened in memory of the Space Shuttle Challenger crewmembers that were lost during the shuttle's tenth mission. The center's aim is to teach visitors about space exploration. The Wortham IMAX Theatre and the offsite George Observatory were opened in 1989.\nMuseum attendance was more than one million visitors in 1990. HMNS trustees determined that new state-of-the-art facilities, additional space, and renovations to current exhibits were needed because of the increased attendance. Between 1991 and 1994, a number of exhibit halls were renovated and the expansion of the Sterling Hall of Research was completed. The Cockrell Butterfly Center and the Brown Hall of Entomology opened in July 1994.\n\nIn March 2007, the museum opened the HMNS Woodlands X-ploration Station, located in the Woodlands Mall. The facility was home to an interactive Dig Pit, where children could excavate a mock Triceretops, a variety of living exhibits, fossils, and minerals. The Woodlands location closed on September 7, 2009, less than a month before HMNS opened a satellite museum in Sugar Land, Texas.HMNS celebrated its 100th year in 2009. During that year, the museum offered a multitude of family programs, lectures, free events, and kids' classes as part of the \"Fun Hundred\" celebration.On October 3, 2009, HMNS opened its satellite museum in Telfair, Sugar Land. The building and surrounding land that became HMNS at Sugar Land was once part of the Central Unit, a Texas Department of Criminal Justice prison that had been unoccupied for several decades.\nIn March 2012, the Wortham IMAX Theatre was converted from 70 mm film to 3D digital and renamed the Wortham Giant Screen Theatre.In June 2012, HMNS opened a new 230,000 square foot wing to house its paleontology hall, more than doubling the size of the original museum. Paleoartist, Julius Csotonyi, created fourteen murals based closely on concept drawings by HMNS Curator of Paleontology, Robert Bakker, for the new paleontology hall. The Morian Hall of Paleontology contains more than 60 large skeleton mounts, including three Tyrannosaurus rex and three large Quetzalcoatlus.\n\n\n== Permanent Exhibits ==\nThe Foucault pendulum, demonstrating the Earth's rotation. The length of the pendulum's cable is over 60 feet (18 m) long.\nCullen Hall of Gems & Minerals, featuring a large exhibit of over 750 crystallized mineral specimens and rare gemstones.\nLester and Sue Smith Gem Vault, showcasing some of the most exquisite finely cut gems in jewelry.\nFarish Hall of Texas Wildlife exhibits animals and wildlife native to Texas. The hall contains a video wall that displays the plants, animals and topography of the seven biotic regions of the state.\nEvelyn and Herbert Frensley Hall of African Wildlife, a display of taxidermied animals, including one of only two okapis exhibited in North America. Opening in 1969, the hall allows visitors to explore the seven biomes of the continent of Africa. Contains over 120 specimens, including 42 species of birds and 28 species of mammals are on display.\nStrake Hall of Malacology, with many specimens of mollusks.\nMorian Hall of Paleontology, the largest paleontology hall in the United States. Contains over 60 major skeleton mounts, including three Tyrannosaurus rex, a Diplodocus and the most complete Triceratops skeleton ever discovered. It also houses one of the largest trilobite collections in existence.  Robert Bakker serves as Curator of Paleontology.\nJohn P. McGovern Hall of the Americas, showing more than 50 cultures worth of pre-Columbian archaeological artifacts.\nWelch Chemistry Hall, with interactive chemistry related displays and a periodic table of elements with a sample of each element.\nWiess Energy Hall, with displays themed around energetics, petroleum geology, and oil exploration. Renovated and expanded in 2017, the hall consists of 16 sections, including a working replica of an offshore drilling rig drill floor, a 15K resolution video depicting the history of energy, the \"Geovator\" (a simulated trip into the rock beneath Houston and back in time to the Cretaceous Period), the \"Eagle Ford Shale Experience\" (a simulated journey to Karnes County, TX, to experience the hydraulic fracturing of an oil well from inside the cracked rock), \"Energy City,\" (a 1/150th scale white model depicting the entire energy value chain brought to life through projection mapping using 32 laser projectors), and Renewable and Future Energy Sources.\nHall of Ancient Egypt opened in May 2013 and contains many millennia-old artifacts and features recreations of Egyptian temples and mummies from this ancient primary civilization.\nCockrell Sundial opened in 1989 and is one of the world's largest sundials.  It includes lenses on a special chrome ball on top of the gnomon so that at solar noon on the equinoxes and solstices, sunlight shines through and casts an image of the Sun.  Large sunspots can be seen by holding a white card in the beam and moving until it is focus.\nEarth Forum, which opened in 2002, is a computer-aided and hands-on exhibit teaching about Earth and its processes.  The \"Earth Update\" software was developed by Rice University with NASA funding.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nBurke Baker Planetarium presents a range of science and astronomy shows. As of 2016, the planetarium is equipped with the Digistar 5 fulldome projection system. It is one of the first 8k planetariums in the United States.Originally opened in 1969 with a Spitz Space Transit Planetarium, the Planetarium upgraded to an Evans & Sutherland Digistar 1 vector display in 1988, and was the first in the U.S. and third in the world to adopt multiple-projector digital image capability using the Sky-Skan SkyVision system in 1998. That allowed it to show fulldome movies, many of which were created by HMNS staff. Since 2004 its outreach program, \"Discovery Dome\", takes the planetarium experience on the road, reaching over 40,000 students per year in classrooms and special events in portable digital domes.Cockrell Butterfly Center, a butterfly zoo located in museum complex. Opened in 1994, the center is housed in a three-story glass building filled with tropical plants and butterflies. The center exhibits a large range of live butterflies, including the migratory monarchs and their tropical cousins. The Cockrell Butterfly Center was reopened in May 2007 after being overhauled to make the exhibit more interactive; there are now games for children and a live insect zoo in the Brown Hall of Entomology.Wortham Giant Screen Theatre, a 394-seat theater presenting various educational films in 4K digital with advanced 3D technology on its 60x80 foot screen.George Observatory, an astronomy observatory equipped with three domed telescopes, including a 36-inch (910 mm) Gueymard Research Telescope and a solar telescope. The facility is located south of Sugar Land, Texas at Brazos Bend State Park. The observatory also houses a portion of the Challenger Learning Center for Space Science Education.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nCsotonyi, Julius, and Steve White. (2014).

          "What a shock 20.00 to park! The museum is wonderful! To do the \u201cspecial exhibits \u201c it is very expensive! If you do just 2 of them it is 200.00 extra and there are more than 2! Not for budget minded families",
          "I enjoyed this museum. There is parking right in front, a lot of different exhibits to see, great signage to direct to each location, and I loved how the gift shop had diversity in the NASA barbie dolls.",

          "We live a couple hours away from Houston, but visit the museum at least once a year for the amazing permanent exhibits and fantastic traveling exhibits like the one that brought us there today: \u201cThe Art of the Brick\u201d. I\u2019m a huge fan of LEGO and have been itching to see this",
          "Go see the Egyptian, Faberge and gemstone/jewellery collection. Go early and beat the school rush, as the beforementioned exhibitions are best enjoyed in tranquillity with good ambient sound backdrop. The museum is generally good albeit a bit backdated communicatin wise. There",

          "The Energy Hall on the top floor is aimed at budding engineers. It is not just about the oil industry but you can try your hand at robotically turning off a valve on the sea bed, and get some idea of what the engineers were desperately trying to do during the Deepwater Horizon",

          "I was on a school trip and wandered without the students - this place is great! The dinosaurs and the seashells were amazing, as was the model of the moon. The energy hall is really good with lots of interactive exhibits, but sadly still promotes oil as a resource.",
          "Nothing out of ordinary. The only saving grace was the Dinosaurs section and the Egyptian history relics and mummy exhibits.",
          "We have not been to the museum in over 20 years. It has really expanded its offerings since then. The Butterfly house, the fossil collection, the gem collection and the wildlife collections, and many more are some of the best we have seen. The building is vast with lots of open",

          "Don't get me wrong, several aspects of the museum are great, but the dinosaur exhibit is breathtaking and even a bit scary with the dramatic lightning and intense placement of the bones. You really get a sense of the rugged wildness of the past. It is just amazing. Several other",
          "I have been to many natural museums but this one is one of the oldest and it has three real dinosaur fossils meaning it contains more than 50% real bones found in different areas of the USA for example Utah and Wyoming a most see attraction next time you are in the Houston",

          "The permanent exhibits here are incredible\u2014 compared to Dallas and Fort Worth, we feel Houston is the best in Texas for families interested in geology. Both the dinosaur and Egypt exhibits are surprisingly large and very well done. I love the exhibit on the Americas. The IMAX",

          "The Cockrell Butterfly Center located within the museum building, is fantastic with a great butterfly experience. It's a beautiful walk through the subtropic exhibit and watching the butterflies. Take a hour depending on your love and interest in butterflies. Plan ahead and view",
          "An enchanting educational day can be spent at HMNS. Do not miss the current train exhibit! Science- minded children love the interactives oil discovery and refining, dinosaurs,and butterfly center. I had put a drop of jasmine oil in my hair which attracted a beauty that sat on",

          "I tough that this would be a bigger museum, so maybe because of this I was a little disappointed. The Egypt department is cool and the dinosaurs is good but that\u2019s it.",
          "20 school buses arrived at the same time as we did ! It was lovely to see all those eager youngsters. We particularly enjoyed the spectacular displays of minerals and to see the history o the house of faberge - supplemented with a special exhibit of the work of one of the chief",
          "Interesting to both kids and adults alike. The butterflies are amazing--hundreds of them in a 3 story glass structure. The planetarium shows movies that are projected onto the dome of the planetarium--we watched the Reef movie and it was great. The regular exhibits are",

          "It\u2019s a lovely place to spend the day. The only mentions to take into account are that the Egypt section needs someone to fix the mismatched displays and their descriptions. It does get a little annoying when what is described by number, is not what you see on the numbered",
          "This museum was one of the best ever I\u2019ve visited There is so much to see. The displays are awesome and many are historically authentic The IMAX theatre and Planetarium are a must see Well worth the extra cost. Also they have a good cafe right there to grab a lunch This is",
          "So glad we bought tickets. Will definitely be going again. Tried to pack as much as I can into 4 hours. The death by natural causes exhibit was amazing.",
          "I love the butterfly exhibit! The display of butterfly specimens is very interesting. However, the best part is being able to interact with and photograph the living butterflies. Wear bright colors as they are attracted to them. Increases the odds of one visiting you up close.",
          "We went to the museum before we had to the go to the Texans game and that was definitely not enough time to really enjoy all the museum has to offer. It was a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. We really enjoyed the dinosaur exhibits and the staff there were very",
          "I haven't been there in a couple of years and I am glad I went again. There is a whole newish exhibit in the top floor that is Oil and Gas related. There is even a big simulator that takes you on a \"ride\" to a fracking site. Doesn't matter if you are pro or against fracking, you",
          "This is a fantastic place for adults or children. This teaches you, in one place, you would have to travel many places to see. Love this place",
          "The Art of the Brick is a limited time exhibit at the museum (until March 29, 2020). Created by Nathan Sawaya, it is a display of artwork created by Nathan using Legos. It is - to put it in one word - fascinating. It is simply incredible what Nathan has done using Legos,",
          "We had an incredible time here! The museum is HUGE and has so many exhibits (even without visiting the ones you have to pay extra to see). There were many different subjects and types of exhibits (dinosaurs, gems, animal habitat displays, chemistry, seashells, etc.). I would",

          "Wide variety of exhibits from Naiver American displays to archeology, geology & palaeontology. great!",
          "The best dinosaur exhibition I have seen in a museum. The display of native animals in their natural bushland setting is well done. Sound effects have been added so bird calls and animal noises can be heard. Other exhibits were worth viewing also. However, two complaints need to",
          "Way over the top in providing displays, information, context, and interaction. They include live animals, interactive computer displays, and lots of historical items. Well worth the extra ticket price. Kudos to the curators for creating such a compelling exhibit.",

          "A very unusual museum experience. They offer no paper maps of the museum. We were told there was a map behind the large Moon display. That was hard to find and we needed our smartphone flashlights to look at the map. There were names of museum sections but no descriptions. There",

There\u2019s layers to the dome and it\u2019s super hot on the very first according to the habitat of the butterfly and cooler on the second layer and warm on the bottom.

          "I had a bit of an idea of what to expect but was really impressed with the entire museum. I arrived a bit later than I should have to thoroughly experience the entire museum. The highlights for me were the dinosaur, Central American, and Egyptian areas. The only downside",
          "Always enjoy our visit to the Natural Science Museum. The permanent offerings include dinosaur fossils, the imax theatre, and of course the butterfly area. There are few places to experience peace and quiet in Houston. Go visit the butterfly exhibit on a weekday. It is worth",

          "Can't miss the enormous exhibit of the moon as you first walk in - impressive! We could only spare one afternoon here, but could have easily spent the entire day. Well done exhibits from dinosaurs to Egyptian and much more. Worth the trip! Parking garage attached to this",

          "The Egyptian exhibit is outstanding. They have a wide range of authentic Egyptian art from tombs and many mummies including a mummified cat. My favorite is the Roman mummy, quite unusual. This mummy is the only mummy I have ever seen with a red beard, which verifies he\u2019s",
          "Really interesting exhibits and loads of them! I highly recommend going for a planetarium showing. You could easily spend a whole day here since there's so much to see and learn about. I wouldn't say it's necessary to pay for the extra exhibits since there's already a lot to",
          "On a day when it was too hot outside we went to this museum, the dinosaur skeleton collection is superb even If your not really interested in old bones. Out of season and on a Monday it was fairly quiet and uncrowned. Well worth a visit.",
          "A beautiful visit. So many different butterflies and flowers. We spent almost 2 and a half hours. The display of insects and \u201cbugs\u201d was very interesting to a science guy like myself. Then into a rainforest climate zone to see all different colours of butterflies. Many different",

          "The museum was not as large as I expected it to be. However, the gems and minerals exhibit was absolutely the best part! The vault displayed the most gorgeous gems I have ever seen. The dinosaur exhibit was also a great highlight to my visit. Definitely reccommend this museum!",
          "We spent several hours at the museum and it wasn\u2019t enough time. There\u2019s so much to see. We opted for the planetarium show. It was informative but I think it was more geared for teens and adults. The prehistory exhibits with dinosaurs was amazing and extensive. We ran out of",

          "The amount of dinosaur\u2019s fossils and Egyptian artifacts it has, makes the visit worth it. The planetarium is quite immersive.",
          "Went to the Houston Museum of Natural Science only to find that there was a corporate event not publicised by them on any media including their website so was closing early. Many families turned away as did we. Most disappointed as this spoiled our day.",

          "The museum was fine but after paying admission charge everywhere I turned was an exhibit that had an additional cost.",
          "This museum is unique in that there are exhibitors here that prefer this museum to other museums of natural history. For example, there is an exhibit of sculptures of animals made from natural stone whose exhibitor chose to exhibit only here at the Houston MNS. There is also a",

          "This was an awesome way to spend the day. They had exhibits for everyone. The staff was very nice as well.",
          "We really enjoyed ourselves. They have a large collection of dinosaurs and extinct animals. They had a huge area of taxidermy- we found it a bit disturbing that a lot of the displays seemed to feature one animal attacking other animals, but it\u2019s natural I guess! They also had",
          "Amazing in all aspects, there is always new things to see and extremely family friendly, the upper new part is very interesting for young ones and adult too.",
          "This is a fun and interesting collection of natural causes of death. It takes about 45 to read all of the placards. Our older teen aged kids loved it. Our pre-teen daughter was less interested.",
          "The best science museum ever. Interactive , a sight to be seen! There is also 3d movies being shown there in the building made up of very large artist's sculptures of a fantasy world. My fave movie was the planetarium. You really feel like you are in the cosmos and it's so",

          "My husband and I were so very impressed . First time visiting and one day there is definitely not long enough. So many interesting exhibits. Good deals on Groupon and staff are helpful. Great for kids and adults. I would absolutely recommend a visit to this museum, just allow",

          "At first we were kinda lost as we just wanted to see the regular exhibits and it was a bit confusing. Once we figured out that the real exhibits started on floor two we were fine. Tons to see and very glad we came!!",
          "Very impressive display of dinosaur bones which fascinates children and adults. Saw IMAX with Apollo 11 documentary which was very timely for 50-year Anniversary. They had additional choices. Very nice planetarium with a few different choices. Plus, there were more exhibits",
          "Just a heads up... the entrance fee is budget friendly, however extra attractions in the museum, butterfly, imax etc..., cost extra. The Houston city pass only gets you in the door. If you are a family of 4 wanting to do the extra activities it will cost your family at least $100",
          "Thursday is free from 6 pm - 9 pm. Summer Camps and families keep it a very busy place to visit. So big and so much to see, you need to plan your visits and target what you want to see. Lacks in places to eat and could use better signage. A map would be helpful. Wonderful",

We all agreed, this was the absolute",
          "Enjoyed all the available exhibits. It has many unusual things I had never seen before. What I hate about anyplace is having to pay and admission fee then have to pay again to see \"special\" exhibits. Needless to say we did not attend any of those.",

          "We drove from Austin to Houston just to visit the Museum of Natural Science. There's so much to see for my two young girls that we stayed for over four hours to get through everything in the museum. It's especially beneficial for the children to learn about science and opened",

          "We took our two-year-old granddaughter, and she had a wonderful time. She was already very keen on butterflies because of the Monarchs attracted to the Milkweed plants in our backyard. Seeing hundreds of butterflies all at the same time and even having some land on her is an",
          "Overall we had a good time at the museum! We looked up a coupon online and found tickets for 10$ each, so I highly recommend doing that as 25$ for a regular ticket is pretty steep. I wish there were more space exhibits but nevertheless the exhibits that were there were enjoyable!",
          "We went to this fantastic museum on free Thursday from 6-9pm. They have a great display with so much to learn. It was crowded but we didn\u2019t mind because so many people were here getting out of the heat and enjoying the museum!",

          "This was the best exhibit in the whole museum! We loved it!!!it was amazing! Our 3 yr old had been wanting to do it for months. City pass does not cover this! You have to pay 8$ per person to go!",
          "Very interesting place that are packed with people. A lot of interesting things to watch. The butterfly section is a must.",
          "Very crowded, no parking. Line to get tickets was ridiculously long. Once inside the museum it was ok at best, mostly reproductions not many actual artifacts.",
          "Highly rec this museum. Exhibits change so dont just go once and forget about it!! The science based interactive exhibits are a great teaching tool for parents and their children",
          "This is an excellent museum. I've been to all the Smithsonians, the Museum of Natural Science in NY, and others and this one matches them all. The exhibits are unbelievable and comprehensive. It is a little overwhelming when you enter with all the choices, pricing, but it",
          "We had a short time time to visit the museum on July 5. Although it was a high traffic day, the museum was very enjoyable. The Butterfly Exhibit is one of a kind. It is like being in a tropical paradise. Check out the fourth floor energy exhibit. It is a great introduction",
          "I could spend days here! This museum has it all. I enjoyed the butterfly habitat which is essentially four stories and thousands of free-range butterflies! The planetarium was really cool - they have a variety of shows, but the one I attended was a great look at our solar system",
          "I have a family pass for the kids. They are teens now and still enjoy going and learning. The moon exhibit was awesome. There\u2019s always something new or sometimes you miss something because there is just so much to see. Great for cooling off after the zoo as well.",
          "Our family scheduled a 2 hour private tour with Mr. Rich Hutting. WOW! Interesting fun facts, knowledgeable and entertaining! If my pictures seem blurry it was because we were always \u201con the move\u201d with Rich as he would quickly transition to so many interesting exhibits that",

          "My friend and I had a great time, we arrived a bit close to closing so I suggest getting there to avoid rushing. It wasn't busy and we were able to move freely. The best part was the mummies in general admission but we also had a good time learning in the Natural Causes Exhibit.",
          "Our visit to the Houston Museum of Natural Science was very enjoyable. I was looking forward to taking our sons because they recently put up a Moon display. We had a very worthwhile visit. We took the Dinosaur tour and enjoyed it a lot. I had never purchased a tour before and",

          "We enjoyed the biophillia art and the animal show cases! Great collection and fabulous germ displays. I gave it 4 stars just because the parking is $20 flat rate. It would make more sense if it has hourly rate because not everyone goes there for the whole day.",
          "I love how the museum offers various and different types of experiences for different ages and different interests all in one location. The young teens did roll their eyes at me about going to a museum but as our visit continued they surely did warm up to the experience. The",

          "An above average museum in many aspects. Well laid out and easily maneuvered through. Very accessible. The gem collection is a must see. However, the butterfly collection could use some work.",
          "The museum is a must see. The exhibits were amazing and you could literally spend all day just on the general museum section. However, bring your own lunch. I had read that there was now a grill that replaced McDonald\u2019s.(McDonald\u2019s burgers were better than these, and I don\u2019t",
          "We throughly enjoyed our visits. There\u2019s truly an exhibit that everyone in your family will enjoy. My husband likes the Faberg\u00e9 exhibit while my kids loved the dinosaurs and geology displays. I LOVED the fine gems collection.",
          "We took our granddaughters, 9 and 11, and we all had a great time! The Virtual Reality tour of the moon was awesome...and our favorite of the day! Pay the extra $5 to do this! All exhibits were very good....I know we missed some things because they were hidden behind other",
          "I was a little skeptical about another science museum, but decided to go since it was close to our hotel. I was amazed. The exhibits are done well and the museum is laid out in a logical way. We went to the Death by Natural Causes exhibit--frightening! Some beautiful natural",
          "Enjoyed my visit here. I went with a large group of 6th graders. The staff were helpful and informative.",
          "The Houston Museum of Natural Science is a great place to visit. I've been there several times, and discover new things Everytime I'm there. Your whole family will really enjoy it.",
          "Enjoyed a tour of this museum recently. Some very nice exhibits. Enjoyed the dinosaurs exhibit the most",
          "I went twice when I go to Houston visiting my daughter and granddaughter . It\"s really magic, you are never tired of it . Its vey peaceful and so much to see. Colourful butterflies . A must to see for children . My granddaughter is 5 and love it .",
          "That's right. If you see all around you you will see kids roaring like dinosaurs. Mine did. This museum is woth every dollar. I was there with my wife and kids and all I will say is that you cannot go to Houston and not go here. From the dinosaurs to the beautiful moon to the",
          "I visited with four teenaged girls (13-17) on a rainy day. The butterfly center was lovely and we were up close with many different butterflies in their rainforest habitat. The education center outside the exhibit was interesting even for teens. We spent about 45 minutes here",
          "My 3 year old grand daughter loves this place, she gets to see all the \"bugs\" as she says. on the inside of the building and then you can walk thru the tropical jungle on the outside. All the butterflies just fly around and land everywhere. Its a cool little walk to take on a",
          "So many options not just a walk thru museum!! Loved the permanent exhibitions especially the gems /stones and the Faberge\u2019 !!Then there was the dinosaurs!! And more. I went to see the Apollo 11 movie in the Wortham and the 23 foot moon hanging from the ceiling!! Amazing!! I\u2019m",
          "I enjoyed the place but honestly had way too much stuff to look at and read than what I thought there would be. Really enjoyed the dinosaur floor more than the rest but overall it was pretty good. And at $10 a person the price is really fair, plus you have many other museum",
          "This is an interactive and fun museum for all-ages. The butterfly exhibit is really cool, but so are all the dinosaur bones, and the kids area.",
          "I love this place. There\u2019s is simply not enough hours in a day. My only complaint is that the Death by Natural Causes exhibit was not work the hype\u2014don\u2019t spend the extra money. Will definitely return.",
          "I am a member at the Science Center and always bring family from out of town here. Its a great time!",
          "It's a really well done museum, with a very big fossil section and a nice section devoted to the texas wildlife. I suggest buying the tickets online",
          "We went because we were told they had an amazing mineral exhibit. We were checking prices and found that it was free on Thursdays from 2-5 so we planned out visit for then. That was our mistake. Three hours is not enough time to see this museum. We picked just a few exhibits",
          "Fun day at the museum. We visited the museum and was very pleased with the visit. 4 floors of many different exhibits including Egyptians, Dinosaurs, Space, Mammals, Texas theme, Mummies, Faberge egg, precious-stones, and others. Planetarium show is nice but short. Definitely",
          "Very informative and well thought out displays. Many artifacts to show things of the Roman Empire and this dark time in human history. The bloodlust of the spectators is evident by the length of time that this gruesome practice was allowed to continue.",
          "This place is six floors of delight. I was particularly taken by the chemistry display with a live teacher doing interesting things, but also by a display where you get to assemble atoms of various elements in whatever combination you like, and it will tell you what you have",
          "If in Houston, visiting the Natural Science Museum fills up a day with a very interesting learning experience. Several different exhibits and lots to see and discover. A major disturbing factor: it was the most noisy museum I have ever visited in the entire world!! Hundreds of",
          "Lose yourself in the world of wonderment that the Houston Museum of Natural Science. I especially like the butterfly portion and the fact that they change exhibits often.",
          "This is not a bad place to spend time on a quiet, rainy Saturday. I was visiting and so it\u2019s my first time here. Compared to the museum in New York, this is actually small. I was able to see and read a lot for only half a day here and I watched the movie at the planetarium at",
          "This is the most amazing place with so many exhibits and other interesting sections to explore. We spent over four hours here which included a visit to the butterfly area.",
          "Probably I am bit biased since I have visited the natural history museum in London a few times. Some of the stuff definitely will excite the kids, for local half day out its a nice place.",
          "We came to Houston especially to see the Van Gogh exhibit and were not disappointed. We had been to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and were not sure how different this would be, and were impressed by the exhibit. It is well done and displayed in a way that helps the viewer",
          "The Cockrell Butterfly Center in the Houston Museum of Natural Science is a wonderful haven for plants and animals. The Butterflies are everywhere and easy to view and study. The plants are well documented and close to walking paths to make observation easy. Highly recommend",
          "Fantastic Museum that took us more than a day to get through. Don't skip the shows that they have, very informative.",
          "We only had a couple of hours to tour this museum and it was amazing. Wished we had more time to also tour the butterfly house. There was something for everyone at this museum.",
          "I have been visiting here for many years but it has been awhile since my last visit. The new wing is amazing, they did such a good job with the new paleontology exhibits. I only wish they said more about where many of the dinosaur skeletons were found. We also saw the mineral",
          "I had a few hours to spare before I had to get to the airport and decided to go here. First off, while doing my research I found a coupon online with Houston Tourism that gives you general admission for only $10. I was a little worried if free parking would be available but I",
          "The Houston Museum of Natural Science is a good museum with plenty to see. It can be pricey for the average family if you decide to also see some of the temporary exhibitions (all at additional cost). The fossils and dinosaur permanent exhibit is excellent - although many items",
          "The museum was incredible. Great exhibits and lots to do. If you are wanting to really enjoy the museum make sure you block off an entire day to explore and read. If you are not much of a reader and just like to look, a few hours would be fine.",
          "We took our 16 year old grandson with us. He thought the exhibit was cool and he enjoyed reading about all the different ways things can kill people. It was fascinatingly morbid.",
          "We only had a few hours so we didn't get to see everything. We only went through the main part of the museum and there was something for everyone. If you are a AAA member, make sure you ask for the discount. The young woman at the ticket counter was very nice and ask if we had",
          "on our trip to houston we decided to dedicate one day to museum visits. we prioritized and left this museum towards the end of our day and what a mistake. This was by far our favorite museum in houston of the 5 we visited. the exhibits were like none we had even seen in a",
          "We visited the HMNS and were given an informative tour of the Morian Hall of Paleontology by a very charming docent. This is an outstanding collection of prehistoric beasts that are displayed beautifully. We are diminutive in comparison to the full-sized dinosaurs on display.",
          "I visited as part of a school field trip and I was impressed with the exhibits and even more with the docents who brought them to life for me and for the children in my group.",
          "Worth your time. This is a very interesting Museum with a wide variety of exhibits. Don't limit your time since it takes a good while to really see all the exhibits. We ended up spending the entire day and still did not get to all the exhibits. Take the kids, it is",
          "It has so much to offer. From dinosaurs,to butterflies. Not to mention an Imax, a planetarium, along with great exhibits. And, if you don't mind driving about an hour and a half from Houston, the George R Brown Observatory. If you do plan to go more than once during the year,",
          "My grandson and I love to go to the museum. The dinosaurs are first class. Love the butterfly museum and the mummies...... So much to see. We spend hours there. It is truly world class. A must see in Houston.",
          "Visited the museum yesterday and was blown away. Great place and really captures your imagination. Well worth a visit. An added bonus is that after a little googling you can receive a 60% discount on admission rates, but even at the full price it's worth it.",
          "Death by Natural Causes was a great exhibit. They have great permanent exhibits. There are several imax movies that are great. A exhibit about oil exploration. Also big dinosaurs. Many things to do and see. Also a wonderful gift shop.",
          "The HMNS is a beautiful facility with great exhibits and fabulous lectures about many different topics. The children\u2019s exhibits are very interactive.",
          "I had time on my hands and was looking for a place to visit. Everyone I asked recommended the Science Museum, and I could see why from the moment I stepped inside. I booked a ticket online, so received a discounted ticket. I spent about 4 hours walking through the museum to gaze",
          "The fossil/dinosaur section is worth a visit alone. There are some good interactive sections for kids and you can definitely spend a few hours wandering around.",
          "The Houston Museum of Natural Science is a fabulous museum with a very broad AND deep offering. Good that it opens already at 9AM especially for jet-lagged European travellers ready to make an early start. The ground floor paleontology section masterly showcases a truly world",
          "Visited the HMNS while on a 2 day package tour of the Houston area. We found it to be fascinating and easy to negotiate the various areas and exhibits. Many of the exhibits are obviously similar to museums in other parts of the world but we particularly enjoyed the history of",
          "It Was very good had a wonderful meeting and lunch. The wait staff was really good and on top of things.",
          "Despite being mobbed with school children, the HMNS proved a great way to spend 3 hours with my 5 year old dinosaur expert. Clean signage allowed us to quickly find what we were looking for. Complete fossils of three T Rex\u2019s, prehistoric mammals, prehistoric sea predators, and",
          "This museum is interesting for adults and children. My grand-daughter especially liked the dinosaur exhibit and the animals. The whole family was amazed at the Cockrell Butterfly exhibit, which is an additional cost. We have been multiple times.",
          "My visiting in-laws and I went for a visit on a rainy Tuesday and were pleasantly surprised by the amazing exhibits ranging from Mummies to Mastadons. The school busses left at 1:00 pm so we had the place virtually to ourselves. The museum was small but they were renovating",
          "Enjoy the museum itself and the whole area! Many great and fun things to do in the museums and if you are tired, just go to the Hermann park right next and enjoy the great outdoor.",
          "We took our 4 grandchildren, ranging in age from 11 to 3 and they were spell bound. There are lots of interactive opportunities with displays. The 3 yr. old was never bored!",
          "We were highly impressed with the dinosaur fossils at this museum! We brought our nearly 4 year old dinosaur lover and she was beyond impressed!! The quantity of different dinosaur fossils they had were beautifully displayed accompanied by a quick snippet of descriptive",
          "Blown away by the dinosaur exhibits and the minerals and gems section...very extensive and interesting",
          "Very spacious (overly, actually) museum. Reasonably easy to navigate with adequate directional signage. The mineral/gem display is particularly impressive. Texas wildlife exhibit is very well done. This is not one of the best science museums in the country, but we enjoyed it.",
          "The new dinosaur exhibit is the best I have EVER SEEN! The lighting, the displays and the LARGE collection of skeletons is amazing. I love to wonder through and just sit and think about the history surrounding me. The butterfly exhibit and visit are equally amazing and a",
          "This museum is very clean and well put together. At the lowest level they had a lady doing science experiments that was very interesting. We also really enjoyed the mummys.",
          "Beautiful museum, well laid-out and easy to park and walk around. The exhibit \"death by natural causes\" was very eye-opening - somewhat tongue-in-cheek and humorous, but also very insightful. The elements were varied from photos and cases of people to animals, plants, food,",
          "Visitors vary in their interests, so it is difficult to find a place that has something for everybody. This place has it. The great thing about this museum is the diversity and depth of what is available. The IMAX films are one of my favorites. The gem collection is one of the",
          "The exhibits are all excellent, the IMAX shoes are great and the planetarium is my favoriate. There are some many interesting things to see.",
          "A great visit during my grandchildren's spring break. Even as crowded as it was, it was an awesome time for every age of our group - 2 years to 63!",
          "Outstanding exhibit of prehistoric creatures along with the massive dinosaurs. Also enjoyed the Hall of Gems.",
          "Great place with lots of variety and interesting things displayed in a beautiful way. Everything from taxidermy, dinosaurs, gems and exhibits of death. We went early in the morning and spent most of the day there. It was on a Saturday so there were lots of people but it was",
          "The museum district in Houston is very nice. We totally loved the Museum of Natural Sciences, BUT...do NOT go over spring break!! Or literally took us 50 minutes of driving in circles to find a parking spot (we just got lucky one opened up as we were passing by). The lines",
          "HMNS covers a lot of natural science but excels at several items only oil and gas geologists routinely uncover: gems, dinosaurs, and shells. Their gem collection competes with The Smithsonian for Best in the World. Their dinosaur collection competes with NYC's Natural History",
          "Awesome place to visit, so much to see and so interesting hw every section is divided and presented to the public. The butterflies section is a must to see if one has children when visiting. A word of caution during weekdays they do have a lot, a real lot of schools that bring",
          "This is absolutely an all day affair. There are dinosaurs, mummies, gorgeous gems, butterflies, rotating exhibits and so much more. We only allotted half a day and easily could\u2019ve spent the whole day. The gift store itself was a bit overpriced, but the exhibits are absolutely",
          "I took my 12 and 9 year old granddaughters on a Saturday morning which I suggest you go early to beat the massive crowds. Parking wasn\u2019t bad at this time of day $20 for the covers parking lot. The museum was awesome lots of great displays very detailed educational information,",
          "My kids are 8 and 9 and they both loved this museum! We just moved to Houston and were advised to get the membership. So glad we did. It pays for itself just after 2 visits! Our favorite exhibits are the Dinosaur and Egyptian exhibits.",
          "I took 3 children under 9 to this museum. The butterfly exhibit is awesome! We all loved it. The IMAX movie Super Hero Dogs was great and we enjoyed the dinosaur and animals in the main museum.",
          "My husband enjoyed the moon mission tour and the planetarium. General admission to the museum but other things add to the cost. Many families were enjoying the museum which was delightful to see.",
          "We loved our day here. Excellent and Educational exhibits. The Largest Dinosaur Exhibit in North America. Faberge, Gem, and Petrified Wood Exhibits. New Acquisitions. The Texas Wildlife Exhibit is very Informative. Great for all ages. A Gift Shop that has quality items at good",
          "Probably the best paleontology exhibit I have seen in my life, they have a lot fossils and Dino in the floor. You can even watch an area where scientists are actually working on. The staff is really friendly, the only drawback was that the Butterfly center was close due to",
          "There is seriously something awesome on every floor! My kids loved the 4th floor that contained the Weiss Energy Hall best. Personally, I loved the first floor with the dinosaurs myself. Especially since there were staffers all throughout that were there to share very",
          "There is so much to see and read. They change out the exhibits - I would recommend the membership it pays for itself or go on a Thursday most museums are free that day -- the entrance fee that is.",
          "After visiting Science Museums all over the world when you visit Houston's Museum of Natural Science you will also agree with me that this is one of the best.",
          "Easy to reach by the Metro but beware the return doesn't leave from opposite it on the previous block. Great video wall as you enter - kids and adults alike will love it. Comprehensive dinosaur remains and make sure you get to the top floor to see the energy display. Check",
          "Love it so much we have membership. Always amazing traveling exhibitions. But the permanent ones are well worth visiting over and over. The Butterfly is a must. We could sit allllll day here. The museum is more than one can do in a day. Has a McDonald\u2019s and other food as well.",
          "Like many Science museums, this one has collections of fossils and dinosaurs. However, in addition, this one has a fantastic display on oil exploration (surprised it is located in Houston!!!). You can learn how oil is detected, extracted, and processed. Also very interesting is",
          "This museum was wonderful. I am not a science person but it was fabulous. Have student at Rice so we walked from Campus. Really enjoyable afternoon and so many dinosaurs.",
          "I was here for an evening event in the paleontology hall. Although I'm not that interested in dinosaurs, it was a pretty cool experience, and there was a good variety of dinosaurs and fossils. So I can't say anything about the rest of the museum or visiting it during the day,",
          "My spouse and I attended the opening night of this exhibit featuring the incredible art work of Christopher Marley. His ability to see the beauty in the smallest of creatures was humbling. I certainly did not expect an evening viewing dead beetles and other creatures to be",
          "Good natural science museum with good dinosaur collection, great butterfly exhibit, and good planetarium with lots of other quality exhibits but expensive. They charge separately for pretty much everything- general entrance, butterfly, planetarium ($97 for 2 adults) which makes",
          "This place has something spectacular for everyone, from toddlers love of the butterflies, boys love the dinosaurous, and I loved viewing the precious stones.",
          "Get there when they open if you want to get a parking spot. Also it gets so crowded if you wait. We absolutely loved it! We bought the extra Death by natural causes and enjoyed it as well. 5 stories and it took us 4 hours to go through it all. Highly recommend!!!",
          "The fossil displays, including dinosaurs all all types and sizes will amaze adults and kids alike, but there is plenty more to see at this fabulous museum. Great displays on Texas wildlife, native peoples and previous gems, plus a somewhat creepy display of art made from dead",
          "Butterflies interaction was amazing, varieties plentiful. Would recommend this for smaller children. The insects section were nicely displayed and the information excellent.",
          "I remember the museum from 35 years ago and a recent visit blew me away. It has expanded and revamped its' exhibits and is as good a museum as others i have been in (including the one in London). I quite enjoyed it.",
          "Enjoyed our visit. Lot\u2019s of interesting things to see. Highly recommend the time spent. The mineral and jewelry display was well done",
          "You need 2 days to see everything they have here. The Dinosaurs are Impressive, we saw some we never knew existed and the have everything placed in a chronological order. Then we went to the Egyptian exhibition, all I can say is it made is feel as if we were in a real tomb. Then",
          "There was such variety in this museum I spent nearly 4 hours there. Quite a busy lobby area but once inside the museum itself it was spacious. Exhibits are beautifully displayed. This museum covers pretty much everything one would expect from dinosaurs skeletons, Egyptian",
          "Awesome place to visit! Very educational and fun for all ages! They have special exhibits, like the planetarium, IMAX, and butterfly area. Not to mention the dinosaur exhibit. Everything can be a little pricey, however it's surely worth it. There are hands on things for kids to",
          "HMNS is a living museum, and its programs are varied, exciting and well planned. We keep returning to this museum with our entire family, friends and neighbors. Well located, with easy parking, the museum has something for everybody: the butterfly exhibit is superb! the",
          "Love love love this museum. As a biology major, turned science teacher turned physician... this place is great. Of course free museum Thursdays are worth the hassle of the field trips that abound in the area, but this place is awesome any day of the week. I normally ride my bike",
          "We love going to this museum with the grandchildren and friends. We have been members for years and never get bored. There are always new exhibits to see. The butterfly exhibit is always a fun time. The IMAX shows are interesting and educational.",

          "Very interesting place. Alot of stuff, even for people who have zero intrest in science or nerd stuff.",
          "4 adults and 1 preschooler visited on a Thursdayafternoon and enjoyed the experience. We didn't have much time, just 2 hours so we were only able to do a few sections. To enjoy the museum I think you should spend at least 4 hours. Most keen on the Morian Hall of Paleontology",
          "The admission to the museum is free on Thursday 2-5. We even found free parking on the street. The butterfly exhibit was $5 and a great side excursion.",
          "This is a must place to visit if you are in the Houston area. The have nice exhibits and a beautiful butterfly center. I spent almost 3 hours walking through the museum. Excellent to bring kids. I went on a Saturday and It gets very crowded after midday so I would advise going",
          "Interestingly, I visited the Museum only because of my department's winter party was held in the Morian Hall of Paleontology at a night. This looked like a very creative and excellent idea! As a result, I got to see all the dinosaur displays. They were beautiful! See the",
          "The exhibits were very well identified. Did not make it through the entire museum due to arriving at noon and taking time to enjoy the exhibits. The Faberge area was unexpected and very informative.",
          "We really enjoyed this museum. We spent a couple of hours here and were amazed at their collection of dinosaur skeletons on display. It was superb.",
          "We were amazed at the exhibits at this museum- absolutely on par with what you think you would find only in a larger city. The dinosaur exhibit among others is the best I've ever seen (and I've been to the ones in NYC, Chicago). We spent about 4 hours there but you could",
          "We went to this museum only because my kids loved the similar one in DC last year. Apart from the DC's one which is free, this one costs a family around 100$ with entrance fees, parking and drink/snack. It spreads on 4 floors and you can admire and learn the evolution of all",
          "A great place to go for all ages. Have been there twice with my son and school kids and enjoyed the interactive exhibits as well. Loved it",
          "I did not know this about museum! Thursday from 2 to 5 permanent exhibits are free to public! However, butterfly center, planeterium, and other is not free it is separate charge. You need all 3 hours just to see the whole permanent exhibits!! It is worth it!",

          "The museum has always been my favorite. Bob Bakker the famous paleontologist works there. The dinosaurs and other Paleozoic and Mesozoic fossils are spectacular. Their Hall of Minerals contains some of the most beautiful gems and formations that I have ever seen. Don't miss",
          "This is a must stop for anyone interested in the history of the Earth and the creatures living therein...a bit expensive admission price, but worth it.",
          "Overall, this was a very enjoyable museum to visit. I especially enjoyed the gem vault and the variety of gems on display. The exhibits throughout the museum were well done and interesting. I'd definitely go back for a return trip! One tip...we went close to opening time during",
          "The ever changing exhibits are always a fresh sight to see for this museum. They are always updating the visuals of their permanent exhibits and the new energy exhibit is just a relaxing place to visit. If you must go anywhere in Houston, go here. It is also just across the",
          "Definitely plan a whole day and start early and do not go with too young children. There is a lot to see. And try to see if there are school classes, because it can get very crazy and loud with all those kids. And wait times rise of course.",
          "Generally the prospect of visiting any type of museum always fills me with awe. Although Natural Science may not be my first choice in a museum, I'm prepared to make an exception in this case. I found the entire experience very stimulating, entertaining and informative. The",
          "This museum displays an amazing collection of animals and minerals. Unfortunately with very few explanations. No \"big pictures\" for the history and geography of the different periods. No links, no relationships. The restaurant was Mc Donald. Now replaced by a new one offering",
          "I am a geologist and the whole museum is fantastic. I recommend it to any and all students to get an idea what science can do for us !!!",
          "You would not think that the rock section of a museum could be beautiful and elegant, but this one is.",
          "This is a really great place to take a family. There was a lot of people toward the end of the visit for us, but it was still manageable to see all the things. The walk thru history of dinosaurs to humans was really great. The gems and Faberge area was really nice also. The",
          "I was there on August 2018. The museum has an incredible palentological exhibition. The temperature in Houston at summer is very high. So You have to bring and drink a lot of water. One has to spend enough time to visit every exposition.",
          "At first it was very frustrating and hectic. People standing around in lines but not in the ropes. Everyone was confused as to where to get tickets or enter another exhibit. I'm sure someone was suppose to be directing but wasn't doing so at that time. After we got out of that",
          "Excellent museum, one of the best I've been to. Really well laid out, interesting exhibits and just the right level of information (not dumbed down or overly boring).",
          "A lot of museums of this genre have a hard time playing to both adults and kids, and HMNS does a great job of appealing to both age sets. Most of the exhibits are bright and colorful enough for the kids and have areas they can interact with, with good information for the adults",
          "This is an absolutely great museum. We visited on a wednesday and thankfully they were open late. They were open till 8 PM for holiday hours. Parking is available right in the museum complex itself. The museum itself is huge - we spent about 5 hours there and yet couldn't",
          "From parking to entrance fee, to food to all activities it\u2019s all expensive. Four of us had city passes for entrance fee, but with one movie, butterfly exhibit and a pack of fries, it cost us over $125. We didn\u2019t eat there as it\u2019s a cluster and no where to sit.

          "This wasn't my kind of museum. I'm not going to ding the score because of my own preferences though, I'm trying to give it a fair review. The second floor is a giant taxidermy area of dead animals. Not all that interesting, especially since we walked directly over to the museum",
          "My husband and I decided to go to the Houston Museum of Natural Science. It was very busy, kids are out of school and there were lots of families. It's a great place to visit and the big plus is you are entertained inside instead of being outside in the hot Texas summer heat! We",

          "We could have spent 12 hours here. This is a wonderful museum with a wide range of everything. You can get a good deal on Groupon. We got 4 tickets to the museum and butterfly sanctuary for $97. The visit was worth double that. Don't miss out on this place if you're in Houston.",
          "This is a great museum with a broad range of exhibits. It's great for children too, especially the butterfly exhibit. If you're visiting Houston, I recommend looking at the city pass. Houston's city pass is great and this is one of the attractions.",
          "Fun place to take the children especially if they like dinosaurs! The animal exhibits were pretty neat too. There were some areas that were too high level education wise for my 6-10 yr old children (the 4th floor energy exhibit) but they enjoyed pressing all the buttons and",

          "This museum is absolutely worth seeing and experiencing any time. It's been a few years since we've been. My husband and I decided it was a good way to spend a hot July Saturday. The Africa exhibit was educational, the Texas wildlife was interesting and we learned quite a bit",

          "Very few notable notable natural history museums actually display fossilized poo. It's a sad reality of U.S. museum culture. Maybe it's because museum exhibits and displays are designed by adults and not 13 year old kids. I felt this museum would be like all the others I have",

          "The museum itself is amazing! As for the staff, a male employee called me honey and tried to convince me dragonflies don\u2019t have antennae. Little did he know I work in pest control, and he wasn\u2019t fooling anyone.",
          "I love this museum. My homeschool group does monthly classes here and they are amazing. My 6 year old son and my 2 year old love the dinosaur exhibit. We have been to the mummy exhibit as well and they enjoyed it a lot. The staff is friendly and helpful. My son loves the big moon!",
          "This museum is always fun. It was also one of the only ones opened on Martin Luther King Jr day. It was nice to have a museum to visit.",
          "This is a great place to take children and spend a few hours. This museum is a must see for everyone visiting H-Town. hundreds and hundreds of interesting items and artifacts within well organized displays. Also, the staff is very friendly, helpful, and they answered all my questions with a smile. Highly recommend a visit here.",
          "I just recently moved and i love museums ! \nAny and all, this museum is by far the best one of any natural science I\u2019ve been to. The displays are very interactive and lively. The change the exhibition so going back is fun because something different. I became a member and i am so glad i did that!",
          "Very cool and educative place\nIt was one of the best museum I have been with my daughter, she loved it. You can spend whole day just in general admission. We saw the dinosaur, Chemistry, Texas and Africa wildlife and Egypt exhibition. In \u2026",
          "We love the Houston museum of natural science. Although, it is not a great idea to visit during school breaks, or holidays. We visited once during winter break, and the line to buy tickets was insane. In other days, we had no wait at all. \u2026",
          "in general it was pretty good, not outstanding but not bad. the imax movies were alright, visually great, but narrative was lacking something (for the added cost of seeing it). Enjoyable, but once is enough.",
          "This is such a beautiful museum! The exhibitions are perfectly detailed and organized. Three levels full of interesting information plus the theatre, butterfly center and the planetarium.",
          "I was there for an evening lecture and was not able to see much of the museum. But, it is definitely a place I want to come check out more in-depth. The little I saw was impressive.",
          "The exhibits here are amazing. But the staff are average at best. Don't have answers or don't want to answer questions about where exhibits are, what is special purchase or what is included with general admission. The restaurant and some \u2026",
          "This is a great science museum with a wonderful butterfly wing that transports you to another exotic locale. I love teacher PDs offered here, I wish that they held these quarterly instead of once a year.",
          "It's a good museum that entertains our kids. However, it can be expensive to do the museum + any extras (special exhibits/butterflies/etc). Parking is expensive and extra on top of the cost to get in to the museum.",
          "I loved the evolution and fossil exhibit. The Egyptian mummies were very impressive as well. It's an exceptional museum and definitely worth your time.",
          "Amazing natural history museum, one of the largest skeleton and dinosaur displays we've been to, amoung other amazing and outstanding exhibits.  Very impressed with this history museum, the only complaint is the energy level is CLEARLY \u2026",
          "It's pretty good. Quite informative and filled to the brim with artifacts and exhibits. It's well organized and great for people of all ages. Not the biggest fan of the idolization of \"fracking\" though on the final floor.",
          "The 2 year old absolutely loved the dinosaur exhibits. Great experience for all the kids. Fourth floor energy exhibits were a hit with the kids as well. Can be a little pricey so look on Groupon for some deals.",
          "So many cool things to look at, learn about and do there! Very family friendly and the kitchen staff were amazing! Like a well oiled machine!",
          "Awesome dinosaur skeletons collection... Shells and gems collections... Butterfly rainforest! Worth a visit! Must go for parents with kids! Plan for a whole day... There is so much to learn!",
          "Brought our families to the Planetarium to see Unseen Universe, the kids loved it. This is the first time we have been since the upgrade. We will definitely be back. The shows are kind of short, suggest getting tickets for a couple of shows.",
          "Amazing. Don\u2019t skip the fourth floor. Something for everyone.",
          "First on the list of museums I\u2019ve ever been! All floors of exhibits is exquisite and truly amazing.\nOhh yes, no sugar coating - this is worth visiting! \n\nFour floors delivers different awesome themes that makes you appreciate science even \u2026",
          "I enjoy coming here, it's always clean, the staff is very friendly and there is so much to see you could easily spend a whole day here. It's also a lot of fun for kids, there is always something fun for them to see or do so they won't get \u2026",
          "A fun filled place to hang out with family and kids. Dinasour collection is jaw dropping and really good. \n\nAs an adult, you can easily spend the entire day here with areas dedicated to ancient Egypt,  Drilling Technology and Planetarium.",
          "It was a great experience for myself as well as my granddaughter. We had a lovely time but will have to go back because it is so big you can't take it in all in one day with a child. We will start at the other end first next time. If you or \u2026",
          "It is perfection of learning delights!!! If you are a child, you will smile in wonder. If you are adult, it will peak your interest in the natural sciences! There is WONDER for everyone at this museum!",
          "Love this museum. I have been coming here my whole life. Great place to bring the kids.",
          "Best museum I've had the pleasure of visiting! Highly recommend getting the City Pass. Not that the admission only gives you access to the permanent exhibits.",
          "The Houston Museum of Natural Science houses the Burke Baker Planetarium, Wortham Giant Screen Theatre, Cockrell Butterfly Center, and over a dozen permanent exhibit areas that examine astronomy, space, science, Native Americans, \u2026",
          "I like the museum of natural Science because of the art exposition from which one can learn from. I never thought they have expositions of energy related issues. I learned a lot from this place about renewable energy. I have passion for clean energy.",
          "While I thoroughly enjoyed the planitruam. I was very disappointed by the rest of the Museum, having been there last since 2003, I didn't see any real advancement that I would have expected from one of top cities in the US. I honestly think \u2026",
          "Great museum for families. The membership is really affordable. They add special exhibits you can see for much cheaper with the membership. They have an Imax theater, a planetarium, and butterfly center which is a really cool experience. Great trip for one of Houston's several rainy days or 100+ heat index.",
          "If there's any museum that can compete with or beat Manhattan's Museum of Natural History, it's this one. If you appreciate ancient history, this place will have you in tears. The amount of effort trying to make this place looks the way it \u2026",
          "Amazing. I could spend an entire day here. I definitely want to come back without the kids so I can linger, explore, and read everything!",
          "One of the best museum I have been with my boys so far. Many things to do and learn and see. It takes more than a day to visit all general exhibitions. I recommend one day for sure. They have acceptable food also if you don't want to go \u2026",
          "We absolutely loved it here. So much to do and see!!! We loved all the special exhibits and the staples were equally satisfying. This is great for singles, couples or the entire family!!! There's free parking and everything is accessible. This is now one of my favorite museums.",
          "It is an amaizing place. I went there late but managed to see four floors of history. I would recommend anyone coming to Houston to see it. The only dowside is that I paid $20  for two hour of parking. You can be a member and get a discount though.",
          "You need a whole day to explore this place. Definitely worth your time and money. The planetarium, the dinosaur exhibit, the lego exhibit, and the butterfly exhibit are the places I visited. I am definitely going back soon to visit the rest of the museum.",
          "A fantastic museum with superb exhibits for all ages. \n\nThe American history and prehistoric exhibits are also very well done. This is a great museum and worth the visit.\n\nPlan on spending almost a full day at the museum to fully appreciate \u2026",
          "Fun, a bit expensive for any of the extra exhibits or shows. We saw the Black Hole show in the planetarium - don\u2019t buy ticket to this specific show (I can\u2019t vouch for the others). The planetarium is beautiful but explain to me why I\u2019m \u2026",
          "Really fantastic. We particularly enjoyed the butterflies. They would get 5 stars if they had better signage.",
          "Get there early and, unless you're a museum member,  buy your tickets in advance to save yourself from long lines. Truly one of the better museums to go visit. It takes now than 1 visit to see everything. Egypt exhibit could use back lighting for display information as it's difficult to read what everything is.",
          "Awesome museum they always have new exhibits going on. The staff are awesome also. Love taking my daughter she gets so amazed with the stuff here",
          "What a great place to visit!  So many things to see.  We watched the Great Barrier Reef. It had beautiful photography.  We feel we were there and didn't even have to get wet!\n\nThe butterfly collection does not disappoint.  We saw many \u2026",
          "This sprawling museum has so much to offer. The exhibits are so very well laid out and really they do a great job of filling the space with as many artifacts as possible. Will be coming back to spend more time here next time.",
          "I loved all the dinosaurs they have, the butterfly sanctuary is super interesting and the bugs they have are super rare. The ant farm was the coolest thing I have ever seen.",
          "Great dinosaurs exhibition. Little bit about Maya, Egypt. The moon was cool.\nBut it still can be more informative. ,\n(Less is more. Less subjects, more data on the exhibitions)",
          "Great place. But seems a little pricey... Saw Stonehenge exhibit. Was very nice.  Got there about 10 am so no long wait.  3d Theater nice but need new 3d glasses.",
          "Always fun to look around. Good educational opportunities for kids. Get the membership if you live nearby. Pays for itself pretty quick.",
          "Excellent museum! Great for all ages. Changing exhibits. It's worth the membership price.",
          "Long overdue google kept wanting my review....Prom night with the dinosaurs was spectacular. All the exhibits in and around, timeless. The food bites were especially nice and more than enough to satisfy everyone, chaperones and students. \u2026",
          "I believe this is a fine museum! \n\nIt is geared more for adults, with the Weiss Energy section of interactive displays that kids can explore. The ride down to view shale was pretty good for kids and the Cockerel Butterfly area was also a \u2026",
          "One of the best things did is visiting HMNS. Just last week I stumbled upon one I\u2019d never been to before. I got to know lot about Human evolution, Fossil, Gem stones and many more , so I am confident in my assertion that I had a lot of fun there, and it is probably better than any museum I have ever been to.",
          "We love coming here! We recently went to the Art of Brick exhibit, which was great as well! HMNS never disappoints",
          "This place was amazing such cool artifacts and each floor level (there's 4 floors) has different things you can learn about. This place is ginormous, also make sure you take advantage of the Houston City pass.",
          "Parking was way too overpriced, and keep in mind that many of the exhibits inside the museum are extra, on top of the regular admission. Which can get costly for large families. I do agree with other postees that the $5 Egyptian exhibit is \u2026",
          "Great place. Went and ended up getting the year pass. Dinosaurs are amazing, kids also like the different animals. I like the gems and rocks. Egyptian section was nice as well. As the yearly pass is free, helps in getting the kids out of the house without spending a fortune at a mall. Worth it and educational. ++",
          "This is a great museum, with very informative exhibits.  You also cannot beat the free museum admission days.  The building is a little dated, however this serves as a nostalgia trip for visitors.  The newer exhibits definitely bring the \u2026",
          "We visited for my daughters 18th birthday because she wanted to go to the death by natural causes exhibit. We got a good deal on Groupon and were not disappointed. The staff at the museum were helpful. We will be returning soon so we can finish looking at all the interesting things.",
          "Wonderful museum with a ton to see, especially great is you love ancient Egypt and dinosaurs. They always have displays on rotation keeping each visit unique.  I think the coolest thing they offer are the events they hold. Ever dance next to a dinosaur skeleton before? You can here!!!",
          "Amazing place for all ages. Great shows at the Planetarium, 3-D movies and the butterfly house.",
          "One best and most extensive Jurassic displays on the world, see TRex and hundreds of not thousands of others. This museum in in the Herman park complex in Houston with eateries and other attractions, make it a great outing in downtown.",
          "A must see attraction, there is something for everyone.  The staff is super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.   Great place to visit and explore",
          "I went with my family a few weeks back (I'm  16 fem, an 18yr old brother, and both of my parents) and I have to say I prefer museums over anything like six flags or SeaWorld. If you or anyone in your family has a fascination for dinosaurs, \u2026",
          "Today we visited the beautiful and amazing butterflies, saw The Art of the Brick Lego set exhibit, and ended with the dinosaurs. We are members so tickets were very reasonable. In addition to what we saw, there are permanent exhibitions, a planetarium and a Stonehenge exhibit. So much to do! We come here at least once a month.",
          "This was the best museum experience I have ever had. The museum itself was incredible, the paleontology exhibit mind blowing, the gems awe inspiring and on top of it all their staff was the most helpful and entertaining that I've \u2026",
          "The membership is well worth it! There's always something new and since we go unlimited times a year with the membership we  can take our time on each exhibit. Not to mention there's a great discount on extra tickets for friends and family.",
          "My husband took me here for my 24th birthday :) it was my first time, so we did (some of) the permanent exhibits, as well as the butterfly center, which was my favorite part of the day. Very affordable if you find coupons online! They offer senior and student discounts as well",
          "From far below the surface to far beyond the galaxies, from long ago  in the past to 250 millions years in future, an amazing  trip where you learn a LOT. \nDon't miss the 4th floor on Energies. It's worth the visit by itself. \nBut expensive if  you add the non permanent topics although they're interesting.",
          "I\u2019ve come here almost my whole life and it never gets old. They are always introducing new exhibits, and the gem section never fails to be breathtaking. The museum is quite large too, maybe not NYC big, but for Houston, it\u2019s pretty impressive. I\u2019d recommend anyone stopping by Houston to come here. And it\u2019s free on Thursdays.",
          "An amazing and beautiful place to learn about the world we live in and how it works while enjoying the time with your family and friends.",
          "One of the best natural history museums in the country. It takes at least 4 hours to go through the whole museum. I loved the gem stones and mineral displays!",
          "Always new exhibits to see. We are members and enjoy the permanent exhibits as well. Not super excited the price for parking went up to $10 for members since we like going often.",
          "Love this museum. Great for kids and adults. The special exhibits are great and full of information that is really fascinating.",
          "Great place but was expecting something newer than the past year. \nPrices are better to look up online.",
          "This is one of my favorite places in Houston. The planets in the sidewalk, the rotating Earth sculpture, the pendulum...they are all familiar bits of home. Oh, and then there are the exhibits!",
          "Fun place to visit. May not be that great for little kids, but if they are older they will find it enjoyable. The butterfly exhibit is always fun.",
          "Great place to go with kids or just any age. Great variety of things to learn and see.\nCan find reduced tickets in Groupon.\nThe parking is $20.\nThursdays afternoon (2-5 pm) is free.",
          "Really enjoyed the Museum! I wish there were more interactive exhibits. The city with the wind turbines would be great with maybe an explanation, the benefits, etc. We just sat there and looked at it. Did not understand the dinosaur that \u2026",
          "Awesome place! No matter if you\u2019re a kid, or adult, you will like it, and you will enjoy it. I\u2019ve already seen dinosaurs, but the mamoths are awesome \ud83d\ude0e Slothzilla is the best! Pterodactyls are  freaking huge! For some of the animals I feel \u2026",
          "Definitely check out the dinosaur exhibit! It's one of the best I've seen. Consider getting the Houston City Pass too if you plan to stay awhile and see some major sights.",
          "Who doesn't love museums?! The mineral collection and paleontology sections are a definite must if you're making a visit. Admission pricing was very reasonable and the add-on exhibits were abundant.",
          "I came here with my family of seven since my grandparents were visiting from Guatemala and I really wanted to show them the Houston museum. I was going to pay $150 for tickets and parking but the sales receptionist convinced me to get the \u2026",
          "Fun place, very informative and offers a good time to be had. Prices are pretty high however.",
          "Absolutely romantic and definitely worth going with the kids. Go on a date... A Sunday day trip. With your mom. Hope to see it again soon...... Wish they didn't close at 5pm.",
          "So many awesome things to do! Definitely need more than one day to do it all",
          "The gem sectionand dinosaur/fossils are unbelievable we bought a membership here and can bring our family when they visit. They have great walk through fossils with fabulous descriptions of each time period. In the gems I wish they had more \u2026",
          "One of the most interesting paleolithic representations. Plus dynamic displays of wildlife in various areas of Texas. A little heavy on the predator v prey for youngest of kids, but otherwise very cool",
          "They have taken out a lot of their interactive exhibits but it's still a lot of fun. I would say it's not as kid friendly as it used to be but the big moon was super cool and the people their are always so friendly",
          "Neat museum. Went to the planetarium and watched the \"black hole\" show. It is informative, but it must be very old as my kids didn't appreciate the low res graphics.",
          "Pretty good natural sciences museum - Foucault  pendulum, African savanna, Egypt and excellent collection of dinosaurs (main highlight). When compared to say California academy of sciences extra charges for everything including butterfly park, planetarium and so on and hence 4 stars.",
          "love coming here on my day off during the week. all the new exhibitions are very educational and fun. the employees are super helpful and friendly, and the parking garage is super convenient as well.",
          "I love this museum.  It is very well organized and such a wonderful place to bring kids and let imagination go wild.\n\nWe can learn so much from our past.  There is stuff here for the science buff and the history buff at the same time.",
          "Nice place to go and see many different exhibits. I really like dinosaurs and they have a really good exhibit of many different species.",
          "At first it seems pricey but the exhibitions are so outstanding, beautiful and elegantly presented that you will forget about that.",
          "Went there for the first time with our kids whose ages range from 2 to 12. \nPrice wise, and because we\u2019re such a large family, it is definitely worth thinking about getting the yearly pass. In fact, it was cheaper to get this than get a \u2026",
          "OMG. Best museum I have ever been too. Their planetarium is soooo cool. I love their gift shop too! Lots of cool stuff to do, and the exhibits were so mesmerizing!!",
          "The museum is wonderful I went with my family with a few year back there are the more fun for the kids and parents. We went on Thursday to take advantage of the free museum day. The museum with so many things to check out and see I will definitely come back again.",
          "I had a great time here. Spent several hours wandering around at our own pace. We loved the exhibits we did see. And made a note to spend time on the things we didnt get to",
          "It is probably the best place for children to make them aware about Houston TX There are numerous exhibits and the staff is amazingly helpful. Children love to have fun and learn , and hence this is the best place for children!!!",
          "There are always some really cool exhibits in town. Definitely a fun place for families",
          "Visited with my City Pass (I recommend if you\u2019re not interested in going through the \u201cextra\u201d exhibits). \nLove love the dinosaurs!!!\nThis photo is of an actual fossil!",
          "This was such awesome place to visit. The fact that they have free day on Thursday is even better. This is a must visit for those who travel to Houston. Hands down this place is in my top 3 museums I\u2019ve visited.",
          "The HMNS is always a fantastic place to visit! It's easy to spend an entire day there without realizing how time is flying by. The permanent exhibits are always wonderful - awe inspiring collections set up in such fantastic ways - they are \u2026",
          "One of my favorite museums in the US. The museum is structured very well, and has great options for locals who would like to visit multiple times throughout the year. The items on display are always unique, interesting, and well lit. The \u2026",
          "What an absolutely incredible museum - it is so extensive and informative you could spend all day there learning and getting some amazing photos. The \"Death by Natural Causes\" exhibit is a must visit while it's there because it's hilarious, informative and frightening! I can't wait to go back and see this museum again.",
          "Awesome museum. Great dinosaur exhibit. Fun times at the Butterflies too. \nNot enough time to see everything...",
          "This place never disappoint me best museum in the country.",
          "So fun! Lots to do! Took our 5 year old here per his request and he loved seeing the dinosaurs.",
          "Great place to spend a Sunday. Nothing like learning and seeing new things.",
          "Simply amazing. The dinosaur collection is top notch. I mean, they have a 15 foot tall prehistoric sloth, for Pete's sake.",
          "The museum is definitely worth a stop. There is something for everyone to see. One could easily spend a day visiting the museum. There is a food court in the lobby that seemed popular. We parked for free across the street, but it took a few \u2026",
          "A fun place to spend an afternoon. The dinosaur exhibit was pretty cool, and they had some nice displays about Texas wildlife.",

          "Great for family outings! Awesome museum",
          "We started at the phenomenal LEGO Exhibit which both parents and children really enjoyed. The combined LEGO sculptures and photography were fascinating and visually challenging!",
          "Amazing for my best friends wedding loved it just wish there was a way to have a outside opening closer with out having to walk a mile just to go outside to smoke maybe had like a specail shuttle to pick up and drop off parties who use the place as an amenity.",
          "Came to the butterfly center. It was very nice. Not so big but so many butterfly's to see.",
          "The largest display of dinosaurs I've ever seen!  I loved the way they were arranged in \"scenes\" as though interacting with each other.  Behind each grouping was a lighted painting of what the encounter may have looked like when they lived.  Fantastic!",
          "Haven't been in over 10 years, I didn't know it was free after 2pm on Thursdays and now that I have 3 kids of my own that love dinosaurs, it was a no brainer! Everything was awesome and the staff was very informative and helpful. My kids had a great learning experience.",
          "I love the museum.  Part of the permanent exhibit includes the only mummified skin of a triceratop.  Always worth the trip if your kid loves dinosaurs as many fossils and replicas are on display.  Helpful staff willing to educate you as well.",
          "Over the last few years they have rearrange the exhibits to where they are world class. However we were a little bit surprise that the covered parking was $20 that price was not posted outside the parking facility. Considering that free \u2026",
          "We had a blast! It was National Archeology Day and lots of folks with info set up to teach all the littles about Archeology. We bought a family pass and all the permanent exhibits are complementary and 1st come and private views to new \u2026",
          "This will always be one of my happiest places. \n\nEspecially the mineral exhibit. \n\nPhenomenal museum, beautiful, important. Amazing permanent exhibits, sometimes mind blowing temporary ones. \n\nThis place is the soul of Houston.",
          "A must visit in Houston. I visited over 4 times in the last one year and will visit again.\nIf you visit now until New Year, you will be able to view the magnificent train models on the first floor.",
          "This is a spectacular museum, with many permanent and rotating exhibits. Needless to say, this is the pinnacle of entertainment for kids, so keep this in mind on free thursdays! Obviously we are members, as we come so often it is worth it. \u2026",
          "Wonderful experience for all ages! More to see than was described on the website! A must see for all",
          "I come here at least once a year it\u2019s very enjoyable clean and I always seem to learn something new",
          "There was something interesting for everyone. There are things you don't know you'll like seeing.",

          "Yet another highlight from my time in H town. The Egyptian section was awesome and the dinosaurs took me back to the awe and wonder of childhood.",
          "One of the most impressive Natural Science museums in the country.  The Faberge exhibit was amazing!",
          "Very interesting and very crowded. We left after 3 hours and still didn't see one of the floors. But younger children give out and lose interest. Could have easily spent another 3 hours and probably not seen everything. Note if you want to \u2026",
          "Fun place and knowledge for kids to bisit. A field trip for my students and I think they liked it. This is my third time visit this place, it is still fun to come.",
          "So much to see and do.   There are a couple of places to eat when you get tired and need a break.   With the planetarium,  butterfly greenhouse,  and exhibits,  there are plenty of ways to stay entertained and pace yourself.",
          "One of our favorite local experiences. In recent years, they have been working hard to update permanent exhibits and keep a good rotation if temporary ones. Their planetarium is neat and the in house restaurant is great.",
          "Great museum for families. You can buy the Houston city pass and take one day here to enjoy special exhibits you can see for much cheaper than others.",
          "Great museum for the kids. The dinosaurs exhibit is always a hit with my daughters. The butterfly exhibit continues to also be a favorite that fascinates them. Occasionally there are kid activities that help make the visit more fun for the kids and parents.",
          "I was a chaperone for my son\u2019s 5th grade class we really had a blast!! I\u2019d definitely recommend anyone come here!! Set aside 6-8 hours to really enjoy your experience.",
          "One of my favorite spots in the city.  Fantastic museum with rotating exhibits, planetarium, butterflies, and paleohall.",
          "Gets crowded with kids on weekends. \n\nGreat Hall with all the dino fossils is always cool. My favorite is everyone watching the pendulum and then the second the domino falls everyone disperses.",
          "Best museum we've visited. The exhibits were quite a sight. I could spend all day there!",
          "Very nice, clean place. Organized well, we visited the Cockerell Butterfly area and the Museum. My kids loved it! We had to take a short snack break and ended up walking the reflection pool at Hermann park since it was just across the way. \u2026",
          "Great science museum.  Lego exhibit was a blast for kids with hands on activity.  Very busy all the time.  Parking is convenient.",
          "I love this place! So much to see and really affordable. Totally worth the trip!!",
          "Lots of helpful staff, with great information. Wonderful displays, was a fantastic time",
          "This is the most incredible natural history museum I have ever seen! The dinosaurs, mineral/gem collection and Egypt collections were amazing! Go on Thursday and it is free!",
          "Very nice museum. Hadn't been in years and here most recently (Fall 2019) have been going regularly twice a month. You won't be able to see and or do everything in one day. From the lower level floor to the fourth floor everything is a must \u2026",
          "Great place, great price! We spent a few hours here and admission was only 10 bucks!!! They have extra exhibits, but just the main exhibit and ancient Egypt were well worth it. We loved the dinosaurs too, best we've ever seen! Took the wife and kids. We all had a great time.",
          "So many cool exhibits, and the Sunday crowd wasn't too busy at all. I took my almost 1 year old, which I expected to be a hassle but wasn't bad at all. \nIf you have a small child, I'd suggest skipping the stroller and using a carrier instead unless your child absolutely loves the stroller.",
          "Best place to take your kids to learn about science. The parking is kind of expensive, but a given for the area unless you can find a place to park on the street. Good luck with that. Inside, the building is cool (AC wise) and the museum has a continual movement of new exhibits presented throughout the year.",
          "I checked out the Cockrell Butterfly Center and was a lot of fun! I definitely recommend for kids but also adults. You will enjoy and learn a lot. The Rainforest Conservative was amazing! Free flying butterflies and a waterfall. If you\u2019re a photographer you will get some lovely photo I think as well.",
          "I love the museum and all the history lessons for our kids, as well as the butterfly exhibit, but had to walk around the 'evolution theory' exhibit. As for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord.",
          "I love the place my favorite exhibit it's the dinosaurs and the gift shop was awesome",
          "A lot bigger than it looks, we found all the exhibits to be very interesting. The dinosaur/fossil area was great.",
          "Great museum, but bring your own food. Also, if you plan on going more than once in a year, the family membership is your best bet! Avoid the long lines and get discounts for events, and the gift shoppe.",
          "Beautiful exhibits and ambiance! Definitely visit the mineral and gem exhibits- not to be missed!",
          "Been coming here since a kid. Legacy member so I can't wait to raise my kids here. Butterflies are super cool!",
          "we enjoyed the museum, we only did the permanant exhibits. our toddler was having a melt down because nap was missed so we had to walk faster than if we came well rested. the staff was great to interact with. my only concern is the \u2026",
          "I've been to bigger natural science museums but none better. In fact the size is an asset as it is not too overwhelming to do in a few hours.\nExcellent",
          "We went on a Thursday to take advantage of the free museum day. Parking was fairly easy to find even though it was busy. The museum is huge with so many things to check out and see I will definitely come back again.",
          "Quite spacious with a lot of items to look at. Exhibits rotate from time to time, creating variety when you come back at different times. However, the static displays are always interesting to look at and read the descriptions. I personally \u2026",
          "The museum was amazing. The planetarium and butterfly exhibits are definitely worth it. It has an amazing selection of fossils.",
          "Decent collection, but is rather small museum for a big city like Houston. Good for small kids and students",
          "We go to the museum for labs and get to tour it as well. I was so excited to see the new energy level this time. It was so cool!",
          "It's a really great place to go especially if you're already downtown and have some free time. I recommend purchasing a membership so you can get free entry whenever you want.",
          "Very nice and huge you need a whole day or 2 to see everything it was not expensive for the amount of things and information. A most see place when going to Houston. Loved it",
          "I came here with my family of seven since my grandparents were visiting from Guatemala and I really wanted to show them the Houston museum. I was going to pay $150 for tickets and parking but the sales receptionist convinced me to get the \u2026",
          "Exhibits were super awesome, only downside was there were tons of kids running around like they were in a gym.",
          "My fiance and I came here to spend only a half day we thought, and then we were going to visit the aquarium. We ended up staying a lot longer than that, we didn't leave until a little after 6 PM. We loved the exhibits! The fact they had \u2026",
          "everything is really well and factually presented.  it would be desirable if the texts were translated into several languages.",
          "Fun for the kids and close to the zoo, you can ride the train over once you have completed the exhibits.",
          "Beautiful exhibits across four floors. There are a few special exhibits, a couple of theaters and the Cockrell Butterfly center that have additional costs to enter. The butterfly center is definitely worth a visit.",
          "Great museum - keep eye out for ticket price specials",
          "One of the best attractions I must say. Located in downtown Houston, you are sure to see this place especially if your kids love to see dinosaur bones.",
          "From dinosaurs to Egyptian mummies! I always enjoy coming here. The admission is free on Thursdays.",
          "This museum is quite pricey, so it may be a good idea to plan an entire day here. There are additional movies and exhibits which charge an added cost.\n\nOur favorites were the moon exhibit; Chemistry Hall, which includes many hands on activities and a live presentation; and the Gem and Mineral exhibit.",
          "Great place for a field trip or to take the kiddos.",
          "Loved it, next time we will start at the top floor and then work down.",
          "Such a nice atmosphere and staff! Enjoyed my time visiting here and working here.",
          "Was so great to receive a military discount and the dinosaur exhibit was amazing. Spent over 5 hrs walking around and xabt wait to return!",
          "Great experience!  I highly recommend.   Great day, lots of beautiful and exciting exhibits.",
          "Went as a fun anniversary date. Haven\u2019t been since I was a kid but a lot of fun and still very informative. Definitely Houston museum of natural science is still one of the best places to take families or go on a date.",
          "Lots to do here and I honestly regret rushing through it as I had come in the afternoon. The butterfly exhibit is definitely a must and worth the extra money. Otherwise, an average museum experience.",
          "Great museum with ever changing exhibits.  Lots of interaction for the kids,  well presented info.  Whatever your interest, there is probably something here for you.",
          "We spent about 4 hours there and didn\u2019t see everything.  There were multiple floors.  The butterfly exhibit was extra. The displays were fantastic especially the dinosaur exhibit.  Hint:  look for a 60% off coupon if you are not using a city pass, admission should be $10.",
          "dinosaur part of the museum is must need see, and star of this museum.\n\nthe rest of this museum can be found in other similar natural science museum, but would like to recommend to come here and see dinosaur part. i would say the rest of museum can be skipped if you dont have that much time.",
          "\ud83d\ude14  planned my day around the original 2pm free admission. Would of been nice to have more notice of the time change other than tiny print on the website late Thursday morning.",
          "It was a Christmas dinner event. We could visit the stones' gallery, it was amazing. Everything very well organized.",
          "This is a great place for kids to play and learn together.",
          "Great museum, very big as well. The only thing that could be improved is their signing.",
          "They always have the best exhibits! I know that some travel around the country but the way they set it up here is always the best experience.",
          "One of the best museum experiences so far. Get the discovery tour for the paleontology section. Very well worth the money. We had Zee as our tour guide, she was nerdy, funny, geeky and very knowledgeable -  it was a memorable tour. We saw \u2026",
          "Loved it! All the employees we ran into when we needed help were super helpful and friendly. Everyone needs to go at least once.",
          "This was a great surprise! It has been re-done and added to since I was a kid. Amazing fossils section. Beware of the add-ons! Not everything is included but some of the extras are worthy the up-charge.",
          "What a great museum! It has something for every interest and age.",
          "Great fun. Butterfly garden is beautiful. Planetarium presentation, narrated by Tom Hanks, is mind blowing. Super fun.",
          "There is so much to see here every time we come in sight looking at something differently. I always enjoy bringing the family here this is while we got a membership so that we can enjoy it throughout the year.",
          "Valuable place to visit. Good to study. Many kinds of Dinosaurs",
          "Have always loved the HMNS.  They have educational classes for kids, even home schoolers.",
          "Great layout of a good variety of items: very good curation. Good use of interactive exhibits.",
          "This place was beautiful and had plenty to see and do. Came to Houston to visit my girlfriend's family, and this was a must see on their list. It didn't disappoint. The highlight being the royal jewels.",
          "Immediately upon entering the museum my trip was ruined by the guy at the ticket counter LRodriguez. Thank you for being not friendly or helpful in any way! There was zero line and everything you said was laced with sarcasm and rudeness.",
          "Attended a birthday party with our daughter. \nGood place for a party.",
          "The museum itself was great. More of a history museum than science, in my opinion. However, it was crazy expensive and every little thing cost extra including charging adult price for a 12 year old. They do offer discounts except for one; \u2026",
          "Great time for the kids. A rare sight to see so much focus on science.",
          "Free Thursdays. Parked for free half a mile away (I think it's the zoo's lot).  I spent 3 hours and definitely missed half of what's there.",
          "Great place for the family and right across from the park for a great roll down the hill and picnic.",
          "Awesome place to go with youngins, better than just the park. No 5 star because every staff member I came across was underpaid or overworked (I say that because they had 0 customer service skills.)",
          "The process for becoming a member is so frictionless and the benefits are really awesome. We had the membership once before and we're not disappointed. We had a big group and it was easy to navigate the museum and for a prime Saturday it \u2026",
          "I love the museum! I hadnt been in a very long time so alot had changed but I still had an amazing time see all the permanent exhibits!",
          "I enjoyed myself more than i can admit. I love learning new things and the Houston Museum of Natural Science provided the most beneficial and probably the best experience i could have asked for. Staff were awesome and in the fossil exhibit \u2026",
          "This place is amazing. The Egyptian exhibit is mind blowing. The Gem vault will leave you amazed. They have a moon hanging in the lobby!!! Dinosaurs galore. You've spend hours there before you know it. The kids were thrilled. I was thrilled. Going back asap!!!!!",
          "Super cool place. I really enjoyed my time there.",
          "The exhibits are always a good getaway. Just wish there was more closer parking. Had to park at the zoo and walk.",
          "The dinosaur exhibit was incredible. The gems and Egyptian rooms are definitely worth seeing as well. Even the gift shop was fun!",
          "This place is always great.  the staff is friendly and the grounds are well kept.    I love the butterfly exhibit and we just recently went to the lego exhibit.  They were Awesome!",
          "This is the second time we have visited this amazing museum in Houston,  Texas.  It holds one of the largest paleontologist exhibits that we have ever seen.  I'm going to let my 11 year old give his thoughts on this museum. What I really \u2026",
          "I had a wonderful time. The museum wasn\u2019t too crowded, and the exhibits were high quality.",
          "Beautiful place to visit, especially the butterfly farm. Everyone is very knowledgeable. I always enjoy past history knowledge and they have a wonderful gift shop",
          "Best gem in the city. Best paleontology hall than nearly anywhere else in the US. A pair of headphones goes a very long way towards making a visit here an absolute dream. People are very loud in the Egypt Hall for some reason, but headphones take you right back to that ambiance set by the curators.",
          "Great place but could be more organized. Could have spent two days looking around but didn't have the time.",
          "The moon exhibit was amazing, and their gift shop is incredible for people that like crystals and rocks\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Take your kids.\nAwesome\nLoved the butterflies \nVery informative.\nThe gift shop will hurt the wallet but then again don't they all?",
          "I absolutely love the science museum. it's great for any ages adults or kids. And you keep it interesting by adding new events and you scientific artifacts. Highly recommended",
          "Great museum with awesome exhibits. The dinosaur and fossil display is the best I've been to. Staff have always been helpful and friendly. Its a great way to have a fun filled day of learning.",
          "Great venue for the kids with alot of hands on or special exhibits. Its right by the zoo for added fun. The buliding is nice and clean with friendly staff as well. The prices are a bit steep considering you have to pay extra for certain \u2026",
          "Great musium with lots of dinosaurs. Fun for the whole family",
          "Very much enjoyed our trip to the museum, had lots of different types of exhibits which was nice. Had a good variety. We were there during the exhibit showcasing art using animals and it was very well done, very beautiful. Only thing I was \u2026",
          "Real dinosaur bones AND you can follow a tour and learn an amazing amount of information.",
          "Nice collection in permanent exhibition on Dinosaurs, and Africa and Texas wildlife. Also impressive collection of gems and stones. Entertaining for kids AND adults. \n\nSeparate tickets for planetarium, 3D cinema, butterflies, etc. \n\nYou need at least 3 hours to properly see the permanent exhibit and probably can spend all day there.",
          "It's a very nice museum but you better have a lot of money they are almost like a carnival Sideshow trying to get you to buy tickets for everything I'm surprised they didn't put coin-operated doors on the toilets.",
          "Wow truly amazing museum 1 floor of the museum will take you half a day to enjoy.  Make sure to an enough time to really enjoy this museum.",
          "This is a wonderful museum.  Our family visited this place few times.  I was one of the engineer setting up the 3D projection system connected to SGI graphics engine in 2005.  Museum visitors were able to view ancient Egyptian mummy (from British museum) inside out with 3D projection on large theater size screen.",
          "The kids loved it, and we enjoyed it all as well. Definitely recommend the family pass, and checking out the other exhibits they have. Great place to learn and just enjoy your day.",
          "Been a member for years and learned today they charge members ALOT more for special exhibits than public ticket holders. That's pretty shady. This will be my last year going to this museum.",
          "Museum was awesome! I attended for a birthday party and included museum entrance and reduced parking. We got to see half of the exhibits before it closed. We had no idea of the early closure on Saturday. Will definitely return to see the other half.",
          "One of many in the museum district, it's very well maintained with amazingly cooperating staff. Lots of guides available to answer any questions & provide details that you would otherwise miss.",
          "This place was super cool! If you dont have a guided tour and are just walking through by yourself like we did, definitely talk to the team members! Every single person was very knowledgeable and helpful. I especially would suggest getting \u2026",

          "Really well assembled displays.  Old and young alike will find something educational and appealing.  Recommended.",
          "The gift store was my favorite place on the museum. Death by natural causes was fun to go and visit with my son. He's 10 years old. Dinosaurs were impressive. And we learned that Egyptian people really liked jewels lol.",
          "Great place to take your kids, enough exhibits to wear them out while keeping it educational.",

          "Really amazing place with real dinosaur bones! Great museum for both kids and adults. Hidden gem in the city.",

          "I have set up a corporate event and gone personally. The people here are so easy to work with and so professional and helpful. The new Periodic Table food place is amazing, quick, and with a variety of nutritious food options. The temporary \u2026",
          "This is a great museum.  Folks of all ages will love it.  Kids will love the animal scenes and everyone will love the dinosaur exhibit. They have full size fossils of a T Rex and many other dinosaurs.",
          "We recently return from the Smithsonian.  I assumed their museum would make Houston look bad.  Boy was I wrong!!  The people that work there are so friendly and informative!  You can tell they love what they do.  We are now going monthly and hope to continue!  You should go!!!",
          "Had a great time! Museum offered plenty of exhibits for all age groups! Environment was family friend and clean! Exhibits were displayed in a clear and informative way! The military discount was a big plus but pricing for the planetarium and the actual museum are fair.",
          "My review is probably going to be bias since I've been to many museum as both a child and adult. \n\nThis one I felt was overpriced and I guess it wasn't really what I expected. They sell a lot of exhibits and some of those are $30.00. I \u2026",
          "Fun place for any and everyone.  The exhibits are so detailed and it's all interesting. I had 3 kids with me and it was something we all wanted to see. When we got to the butterfly exhibit the boys said they did not want to see, the were \u2026",
          "Any one of the special exhibits is worth the cost! Recommended attraction for home town folks and tourists.",
          "Never dissapointed when visiting. Great exhibits all the time with awesome activities for any age really. It's fairly priced considering the everything there is to see and learn. Gift shop is is expensive which is to be expected but always \u2026",
          "Great place. Friendly advice , go when school is in session, was quite a mad house. Haha",
          "Houston Museum of Natural Science is another jewel in our area. You will find it very busy on the weekends but it is well worth the wait. If you have 4+ family members it is best to get the membership and visit the museum year round. Great \u2026",
          "Was quite interesting.  The Large Moon was stunning at night.",
          "Plenty of Exhibits of various types of science elements fun things for kids and adults alike",
          "Loved it! Our kids enjoyed it a lot.  And without planning it we got there on Thursday which was for free and not crowded!",
          "This place is awesome to visit. It is a bit pricey but we enjoyed it. Definitely will be back! Best part in my opinion was the butterfly area. Had fun taking pictures of them. The girl at the ticket booth was great help and friendly. She \u2026",
          "I really enjoyed the exhibits I was able to visit, though I did end up arriving late and was only able to experience the museum for about an hour or so. They had a huge plethora of exhibits available and there were many things I had not \u2026",
          "Very nice. Had a great time with my two Daughters there.",
          "Amazing!  Took my kiddos ages 5 and 2 they just loved everything about it!  Family fun!",

          "One of our favorites museum s to visit in Houston. Grand kids love the dinosaurs!",
          "Be prepared to spend 4h+ in the museum if you want to see everything. The top floor (energy hall) is sponsored by oil conglomerates, so it\u2019s basically a \u201coil\u201d hall.",
          "Super beautiful and amazing exhibits. I was absolutely floored by the huge fossils. The gems were extremely beautiful, as well. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and plan to return. I wish the price wasn't so high, however.",
          "I'm catching a flight back to Houston from  NOLA just to come back to this museum. I absolutely loved it. My favorite exhibit was the gemstone!",
          "Very cool place that given a day without impatient tag-a-longs would of been incredible.",
          "There was a lot to see and a lot learn. It had so many pretty items. The butterfly center was amazing-so many butterflies. The rotating exhibits were cool as well.",
          "My wife and I had an educational experience here.  Great place to bring a date or the feeling and kids.  Order your tickets online via Groupon and save money. You may park for free for 3 hours across the street.",
          "Be nice to see just one healthy food option but who's counting",
          "I love how the dinosaur bones are arranged in action and not simply standing. The previous stones are amazing too. Loves the animal  photography exhibit too.",
          "Wonderful. Very informative. 3rd floor Lego sculptures is a must see for all ages.",
          "Great place for kids. Little pricey, but very nice and fun.",
          "Great museum,  awesome displays of prehistoric fossils, and extinct species.   It has a movies theater,  butterfly garden.  Beautiful exotic gems displays and so many rare sea shelves.  Top class museum, a must visit in Houston.",
          "Innovative displays, interesting interior layout, fun place to rent for an after hours, private party.",

          "I was blown away by this museum. Highly recommend. Their dinosaur display was awesome! There was some replicas mixed in but it was truly great. Same for the gem, stone, crystal, etc area. I was in awe looking at the brilliant natural photo \u2026",

          "Got a groupon deal 2 tickets for 28 bucks nd just wow!! Got there at 920am nd didnt leave til around 1230! Too much to look at but worth it!",
          "I missed out on their opportunity to name a hissing cockroach after someone... That's hilarious that they did that...",
          "LOOOVE this place. It\u2019s huge and there\u2019s tons to see and do. I have a 5 year old and we never get bored when we visit. The only reason I didn\u2019t give this place 5 stars is because I recently came with family with 2 infants and finding a \u2026",
          "Really cool place to visit. We were there for hours. And lots of little places to eat. The food was amazing.",
          "Awesome, clean, all exhibits in good order and interesting. I loved seeing the fossils in the process of being cleaned and prepared.",
          "The museum includes so many different topics and sections. It casters to many different interests such as butterflies, insects, wild animals, ancient Egypt, outer space, dinosaurs, etc. To thoroughly go through it all, you'll need at least \u2026",

          "The museum is a remarkable place; hard to tell how big it is from the outside but once inside it seems endless. Around every corner is something new and amazing; honestly it could take days to thoroughly explore the whole thing, and in our \u2026",
          "We love to visit the museum. The best parts are probably the dinosaurs and the butterflies",
          "I loved this museum! So much to see and the mummy exhibit was so fascinating. I also enjoyed the Death exhibit too. Only complaint is that the gift shop doesn't really have an array of gifts for grown ups other than expensive jewelry. I would've liked to have purchased more.",
          "Nice place to spend a day with family and or friends. Thursdays free admission to permanent exhibits  from 2 to 5pm. Check their website for ticket and membership rates",
          "Got to love my children to the moon and back. Up close and personal with butterflies. You can watch butterflies come to life. The Egypt displays are memorizing and the wildlife displays are so real too. Loved going as child, now I'm bring my children.   There is a snack bar.",
          "So much fun there and ALOT to see!",
          "Great exhibits, decent price and a lot of learning material for all ages. Loved the Lego exhibit.",
          "Great place to visit, even without seeing special exhibitions one may spend here half a day.",
          "What a cool place! It\u2019s a little pricey for admission and definitely moreso if you want to go to the extra exhibits, but the main experience was absolutely amazing. You could spend hours in there and still be immersed in the atmosphere. I \u2026",

          "Awesome museum, gave 3 stars because the ticket counter said no food or drinks. We noticed that she let others go in with food.  The eatery was way too expensive.  Better off buying or bringing a lunch from outside. Paid 7+ for just a hot \u2026",
          "Such a great museum! Various  exhibits at any given time, great permanent collection, my guests thought it was better than New York.",
          "Hello. I have went here a year back and I have to say, this place had a very interesting vibe and I liked how everything was placed. I had learned about some deadly plants and how to know which are poisonous, deadly elements that were once \u2026",
          "Good if you could avoid bus loads of kids.",
          "Enjoyed it very much, the exhibits were very nice, the gem nd mineral  exhibit was a hit, as was the trains but mainly for the children.  Spend  few extra dollars and go to the butterfly exhibit,  it is totally worth it.",
          "I when there once in 8th grade, come back to it a few day ago. There so many news things now, I was suprise",
          "Great place for families. The prices have slower risen over the years and can get expensive. Students, large groups get discounts, or catch the free hours on Thursday.",
          "Always a great time, whether it's to see the permanent exhibits like the incredible paleontology hall, gems and minerals, or extensive Egypt collection. The exhibits are very well curated, and are great for adults and children alike. You can spend an entire day here and still not see everything.",
          "Perfect! So much science, history, art. Every human being must experience this wonder. 1 day is definitely not enough. I would recommend spending 1 day on each floor.",
          "Houston has arrived. What a wonderful collection of exhibits managed by a friendly, knowledgeable staff that clearly has a passion for natural science. I highly recommend this museum for adults, children, and schools.",
          "(For Butterfly Center only)\nButterfly experience is very magical. You could spend 10 minutes or 40 minutes here. It's like a tropical rainforest inside a museum inside a city. Great respite to give you a breath of fresh air on a busy day. \u2026",
          "The best museum in Houston for children to visit, excellent collection of dinosaurs and special touring exhibits are quit interesting to see too (need to keep an eye on what's coming).",
          "This is a great museum. They have a large array of exhibits from a huge room of Dinosaur fossils to a oil and gas exhibit. They also allow you to have events at night.",
          "This museum is full of knowledge. Highly recommend",
          "We love visiting this museum. Great exhibits, beautiful building and well laid out. I'd give it 5 stars but the cost for parking, especially after paying for entry and special exhibit fees are ridiculous.",
          "Best museum in Houston! I'd recommend it to anyone visiting from out of town. The new Lego exhibit is phenomenal.",
          "Excellent palaeontology, energy, Texas wildlife and gems sections.  Butterfly centre also great - we arrived at the right time, as they were releasing the recently emerged butterflies.  Knowledgeable staff, including at ticket desk, where we saved $50 by becoming members thanks to the employee.",
          "Best part is the technology era on 4th floor. Good place for enthusiasts.",
          "The general exhibit is good for a quick walk through to look at pretty things. However, not a great educational experience in my opinion. Most of the signs are just labels, rather than actually explaining the importance or even any fun \u2026",
          "I could live here. Whenever I enter a museum, I just feel both relaxed and thrilled (even upon revisiting). \n\nThe Egyptian and Paleontology halls are my favourites, the former of which is designed to be immersive between the displays and the music.",
          "Parking is expensive! $20!? Forced to park in the garage or park on the street. Street parking is max 3 hours. \ud83d\ude15\nMuseum was nice, however. Staff was also friendly.",
          "Art of the Brick and Reef movie in the Planetarium were really cool!",
          "Cool museum. Needed more time. Free on certain days but then also very busy. Still worth a visit.",
          "Great place with lots to do. Great exhibits, my favorite was on the geography of Texas. My only gripe is what they charge for parking. $30 in their lot. I just parked in a free Hermann park lot and walked. You get to see the beautiful park \u2026",
          "Had so much fun! My kids ranging from 5-9 loved it. It was very educational. They have five floors of different exhibits. I can't say enough how happy we were with the Houston Museum of Natural Science.",
          "Great museum with tons of different exhibitions, films for all ages.",
          "Always a great place to take the family. I just wish they wouldn't charge for the special exhibits.",
          "Cool exhibits, Thursdays get very busy but overall a fun museum.",
          "They keep changing the exhibits and keeping the experience fresh. I love it. They have a great gift shop which is as large as one of the exhibits. They have a new virtual reality machine in the hall before you enter any exhibit, You lay \u2026",
          "Alot to see..you will be amazed, it is really big..you feel like you are in the middle of the real thing, the drilling pod gives you an actual feel of the pod in motion..come in comfortable shoes, employees helpfull in pointing you in the right direction...there is alot to see..one day is not enough.",

          "Amazing for a date or a place to go with the family! Tons of things to look at and explore. The five levels of this building are packed with all kinds of interesting facts and history. Very interactive for children and adults. They have \u2026",
          "Pubescent \"guard\" was extremely rude (and on an obvious power trip) waited until my daughter and I passed him and I had my hand on the ladies room door before barking the order that we couldn't use the bathroom when the museum was closing \u2026",
          "This was the best Museum I ever visited. So many things to see and learn. A must visit place in Houston. I loved the way it is built and how they are showcasing all the historical stuff. Many good photo locations as well. You will need atleast half a day to truly visit this awesome place. Dont miss it!",
          "It was very nice. 4 floors not counting the main level. Spacious , \"relatively\" quiet if u can manage to go when no kids are there..wich is practically NEVER. Parking sucks.. Had to walk from the zoo just to get a spot. Other than that.. I would recommend it.",
          "Super selection of dinosaur models and some really detailed Egyptian pieces.",
          "Love this museum! The Paleontology Hall is fantastic, I usually get stuck wondering at the amazing fossil collection and rarely see much of the rest of the museum. Three T. rex exhibits! A fantastic, nearly complete triceratops with amazing \u2026",
          "We really enjoy the wide variety of displays. I particularly love the fossils and dinosaurs.  The fossils are cleaned so well they are like artworks and there's a working studio where you can see staff cleaning the fossils. I also like the \u2026",
          "Awesome place I loved come here. Tons of dinosaur bones, makes the imagination run wild. Lots of things to see I spent a long time here. I came on a weekend there was quite crowded. Before you come here I recommend you get a Groupon for a promo.",

          "Staff is very helpful and friendly and we of course love all of the special exhibits.",

          "This place is spectacular. I too my very learned father here when he came into town and he called it \"The best museum he's ever been to.\" They do a very good job at making interesting exhibits and having a wide range of topics to see (dinosaurs, oil and gas exploration, diamonds and gem stones, etc.).",
          "The Lego exhibit was crazy cool and the energy floor was just awesome!  Houston...we have a winner!",

          "Really awesome exhibits to look at, a little bit crowded but not too bad",
          "Really good entertainment and experience. Lots to see and do. Leave a couple of hours for the films and at least 2-3 hours for the museum alone at least. The ticket queues though are very slow so buy online if possible. I will definitely be returning. Clean and slick apart from the tickets. Recommended",

          "Love the exhibits and the ability to learn about so many things.  Extremely expensive.  A large family, or lower income families are limited if they can afford it at all.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Discovery Green is an 11.78-acre (47,700 m2) public urban park in Downtown Houston, Texas, bounded by La Branch Street to the west, McKinney Street to the north, Avenida de las Americas to the east, and Lamar Street to the south. The park is adjacent to the George R. Brown Convention Center and Avenida Houston entertainment district. Discovery Green features a lake, bandstands and venues for public performances, two dog runs, a playground, and multiple recreational lawns.In the early 2000s, a public\u2013private partnership between the City of Houston and a group of local philanthropic organizations, including the Kinder Foundation, was formed with the goal of constructing a new public green space in Downtown. This partnership financed the purchase of a series of surface parking lots on the east side of Downtown. Following the completion of land purchases in 2004, the Discovery Green Conservancy and the City jointly raised $125 million to construct the park. The design of the park, led by landscape architecture firm Hargreaves Associates, began in 2005. Discovery Green's public opening occurred on April 13, 2008; during the first two months of operation, an estimated 250,000 people visited the park.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe City of Houston acquired a portion of the land in front of the George R. Brown Convention Center in 2002.  When the rest of the property went up for sale, a group of philanthropists led by Maconda Brown O\u2019Connor of the Brown Foundation, and Nancy G. Kinder of the Kinder Foundation approached then-Mayor Bill White with their idea of turning the space into an urban park. The Mayor agreed and became a strong advocate of a public-private partnership was developed for the $125 million project. Several other philanthropic foundations joined the effort, including the Wortham Foundation and the Houston Endowment, Inc.\nThe City of Houston purchased the remainder of the land in 2004 and created the framework for the park\u2019s construction and operations, including the role of the new organization, Discovery Green Conservancy, incorporated in 2004.\nWhen the Houston City Council approved the contracts to provide partial funding and support to the park, it also mandated that the \u201cpublic at large\u201d be engaged in the design and development of the park. With the guidance of Project for Public Spaces, the Conservancy mounted the large public meetings and smaller focus groups to solicit public feedback. This feedback became the basis for the park\u2019s programming.\nHargreaves Associates, an internationally renowned landscape architecture firm based in San Francisco, oversaw the design effort. Page [formerly PageSoutherlandPage] designed the park's architecture and Larry Speck was their lead architect. Lauren Griffith Associates. provided landscape and horticultural design services. Artists Margo Sawyer and Doug Hollis were integral members of the design team and produced three works of art for the park. A large team of local and international engineers and specialists supported the core design team. Elmore Public Relations was contracted for marketing and public relations.\nEver since the opening in 2008, the park has added upon. An estimate of $1 billion worth of buildings, offices, hotels, and housing projects were added to the park's surroundings.In 2009 the One Park Place opened. A high-end residential tower that houses 346 units. On 2011, the Hess Tower was built, a 29-story office building. On 2016, the Marriott Marquis convention hotel was built north of the park. A hotel that holds over 1,000 rooms.The park earned LEED certification in October 2009.The Kinder Foundation provided $10 million to help fund the $125 million project.\n\n\n== Design Process ==\nHargreaves Associates and their team of architects, engineers, and artists took thirteen months to design and finalize the park. Notable challenges would be the dense intersection and the intricate design of implementing the garage with the surface park.The park is placed in the center of two juxtaposing cross axes.\nThe linear plaza is lined by a multitude Mexican Sycamore trees and uniquely designed pavement.\nDue to the straight nature of the path, it supports farmers markets, art fairs and parades.\n\n\n== Park features ==\n\nAnheuser-Busch Stage - a performance stage\nJones Lawn - a 2-acre (8,100 m2) grass lawn for lounging, offering views of the skyline\nThe Brown Foundation Promenade - a shaded walkway, lined with 100-year-old live oak trees\nWortham Foundation Gardens - 1-acre (4,000 m2) of flowering trees, plants, fountains and works of art\nKinder Lake - a 1-acre (4,000 m2) lake lined with native wetland plants\nGateway Fountain - The fountain offers a view of water activity atop a sloping granite surface to the park\nThe Natural Gardens - wetland and upland gardens extending the length of the park\nThe Landforms - several sculpted grassy knolls with views of downtown Houston\nMcNair Foundation Jogging Trail - tree-shaded promenades on which to stroll to the lake and children\u2019s area\nMaconda's Grove - where persons can play bocce on the Carruth Foundation Bocce Courts\nThe John P. McGovern Playground\nHagstette Putting Green\nTwo dog runs - one for large dogs and another for smaller dogs with seating areas for their owners\nApproximately 630-car underground parking garage.The Schiller Del Grande Restaurant Group, best known as the creators of Cafe Annie, operates two restaurants on site.  The Grove serves lunch and dinner in a \"signature restaurant\" setting, while The Lake House offers casual fare.On occasions Discovery Green has an ice skating rink.\n\n\n== Public art ==\nMonument au Fant\u00f3me - A piece of artwork by Jean Dubuffet donated by Dan Duncan was moved from 1100 Louisiana in downtown Houston in October 2007 after some restoration.  The estimated value of this sculpture is $1 million, including restoration. It was created between 1969 and 1971 as part of the Hourloupe series.\nSynchronicity of Color - Nationally acclaimed artist Margo Sawyer's installation graces both exits of the underground garage, with accents at The Grove and The Lake House. The 151 panels hold 1,500 aluminum boxes in 65 colors. The paint on these boxes is also used in under water applications for oil rigs and was gifted by International Paint LLC. Some elements are kamelion car paint color and also Dicroic film, a new technology and application.\nListening Vessels - Sculptor Doug Hollis\u2019 Listening Vessels, a gift from Maconda Brown O\u2019Connor, sits in the midst of the Urban Gardens, an ideal setting for these serene and graceful pieces. The two parabolas, cut from solid limestone and spaced 60 feet (18 m) apart, epitomize Hollis\u2019 desire to call attention to events that are taken for granted, such as conversation. Visitors are intended to come across the vessels and gain an understanding of their function as they realize they can hear the words of another person speaking at a normal volume, a great distance away.\nMist Tree - Hollis also created the Mist Tree, a gift from Fayez Sarofirm, located next to the playground. The Mist Tree is a 15-foot (4.6 m)-high-by-22-foot-wide stainless steel structure that is sited to attract people to the park. Visible from beyond the park\u2019s boundaries, the rain curtain and mist streams generated by the tree will entice children and adults to refresh themselves in its delightful shower.\n\n\n== Planned events and uses ==\nDiscovery Green offers a variety of programming throughout the year. All events at the park are free and open to the public, unless otherwise noted. Discovery Green presents Houston's performing, literary and visual art in its Art Series. Discovery Green's Entertainment Series offers movies, Extreme Wii competitions, and concerts by musicians that present a variety of Gulf Coast and Central Texas sounds. The Healthy Living in the Park series offers a weekly urban market and exercise classes such as Pilates, Yoga, Parkour and Zumba as well as a Hip2BFit exercise class just for kids. The Families & Children Series offers hands-on workshops and activities suitable for children and their parents.\nOn weekends, families can visit the park, put their pets in one of two dog runs and watch their kids play on the playground while they discard their newspapers and cans into recycling bins.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nUrban parks\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiscovery Green website\nDubuffet Website\nMargo Sawyer Website\nDouglas Hollis\nHargreaves Associates",

          "Didn't get the full hype about this place. I was entertaining my 14 year old nephew and was told about Discovery Green as something to do for fun. We went, and I must say, neither of us was too thrilled. It's nothing more than a semi-glorified park.",

          "This seemed to be a good place to find diversions for any ages. My teenage daughter and I went with friends of ours who had two small children (5 and 7). The two small kids were able to run and play in the many fountains, while my daughter and I walked around the park.",

      "name": "Downtown Aquarium",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Downtown Aquarium is a public aquarium and restaurant located in Houston, Texas, United States that was developed from two Houston landmarks: Fire Station No. 1 and the Central Waterworks Building. The aquarium is located on a 6-acre (2.4 ha) site at 410 Bagby Street in downtown Houston. It houses over 200 species of aquatic animals in 500,000 US gallons (1,900,000 l) of aquariums. The complex includes two restaurants, a bar, and banquet facilities. It offers programs such as Marine Biologist for a Day, Zoologist for a Day, Sea Safari Camp, overnight stays and more. The education department works with school groups and conducts outreach programs.\nThe Downtown Aquarium in Houston is owned and operated by Landry's, Inc. and accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1999, the City of Houston put out a request for proposals for the redevelopment of Fire Station No.1 in the 400 block of Bagby, and the nearby Central Waterworks plant. In mid-2000, Landry's plan was accepted over an alternate proposal by the Post/Cordish partnership. The Central Waterworks plant would be a shark and ray exhibition habitat. The main restaurant would be on the second floor of the old firehouse, which would remain intact while construction took place around it.The Downtown Aquarium was opened in 2003.In late 2015, a campaign targeting the Aquarium's white tiger exhibit was launched by animal rights activists. The Downtown Aquarium rejected the criticism of the exhibit by stating that their \"tigers receive exemplary animal care,\" and \"our tiger exhibit has been accredited by AZA, and every year by the USDA.\" The Animal Legal Defense Fund has threatened to file a lawsuit if the aquarium does not close the exhibit and transfer the tigers to a sanctuary.\n\n\n== Allegations ==\nOn September 19, 2016, the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) served Houston's Downtown Aquarium (and Landry's, Inc.) with a notice of intent to sue for violations of the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). The notice alleges harm and harassment to a federally listed endangered species: four tigers, who are kept in \"deplorable conditions\" at the Aquarium. In the notice, the Animal Legal Defense Fund offers to rehome the tigers to a reputable, accredited sanctuary at no cost to Landry's. If Landry's declines this offer, ALDF plans to proceed with litigation after 60 days.According to the notice:\n\nIn December 2004, Landry's transported four white tigers to its Downtown Aquarium restaurant and amusement park complex in Houston, Texas. For the last 12 years, Landry's has deprived these four tigers\u2014named Nero, Marina, Coral, and Reef\u2014of any access to sunlight, fresh air, or natural surfaces. These species-inappropriate living conditions violate the ESA, which has protected tigers since 1970.\nIn the wild, tigers cover a range of up to 40 square miles. In contrast, at the Downtown Aquarium, the tigers' entire world is limited to a few hundred square feet. The tigers alternate their time between the concrete \"Maharaja's Temple\" on display to the public and a small metal cage out of the public's sight. At no point do the tigers have the opportunity to run, jump, or engage in the full range of their natural behaviors.\n\"The dungeon-like conditions that the tigers are forced to endure at Houston's Downtown Aquarium harm their physical health and psychological wellbeing, and deny them much that is natural and important to a tiger,\" says renowned big cat veterinarian Dr. Jennifer Conrad. \"It is cruel to confine complex, roaming carnivores such as tigers to a tiny, dark, artificial, unenriched enclosure where they never see any daylight, much less bask in sunshine, and are at risk for serious long term, debilitating injuries from being forced to live on slippery, unyielding concrete their entire lives.\"\nThe tigers' living conditions starkly contrast with the decades-long trend to place captive tigers in more natural habitats, such as the tiger habitat at the Houston Zoo. Of the more than 100 Association of Zoos and Aquariums-accredited facilities housing tigers in the United States, only one other facility does not have an outdoor exhibit for the tigers: the Downtown Aquarium in Denver, also owned by Landry's.\n\"Tigers are complex apex predators with specific biological, environmental, and enrichment needs,\" says Animal Legal Defense Fund Executive Director Stephen Wells. \"Landry's, Inc. should stick to the restaurant business and leave the housing of tigers to those who are able to provide big cats with proper care and naturalistic habitats rather than sacrificing the wellbeing of an endangered species for the sake of tourist dollars.\"\n\nBy forcing these tigers to live in what amounts to a concrete dungeon, Landry's has profited financially, but caused the tigers serious mental and physical harm. Keeping the tigers at the Downtown Aquarium advances no conservation purpose under the ESA. Retiring the tigers to a sanctuary will guarantee that the tigers may spend the rest of their lives in the species-appropriate conditions that they need and deserve. \n\n\n== Aquarium Adventure exhibit ==\nThe Aquarium Adventure Exhibit in the main building consists of 5 main themed areas, plus the tiger habitat and interactive displays.The Louisiana Swamp exhibit is home to animals from the marsh and bayous of the Gulf Coast, including alligators, turtles, tarpon, spotted gar, salamanders, catfish, and bullfrogs.\nThe shipwreck puts visitors inside the sunken hull of a 17th-century Spanish galleon where they can look, out to see living coral reefs and sea creatures including a giant Pacific octopus, a moray eel, clownfish, tangs, grouper, snapper, garibaldi, sea anemones and sea stars.\nThe Rainforest exhibit explores the tropical rainforests of the world, and life inside their rivers. The exhibit features macaws, Red-bellied piranha, freshwater stingrays, emerald tree boas, poison dart frogs, archerfish, arowana, and skinks.\nThe Sunken Temple showcases species such as lionfish, Goliath bird-eating spider, porcupinefish, an electric eel, and a reticulated python.\nThe Gulf of Mexico exhibit features an oil rig habitat theme that includes a nurse shark, snapper, redfish, tarpon, jacks, blue runner and more.\nDiscovery rig features sea horses, discus, triggerfish, a dogface puffer, a chuckwalla and more. It also accommodates a touch screen Ocearch shark tracker.\nThe White Tiger of the Maharaja Temple exhibit houses the aquarium's white tigers. (On September 19, 2016, Downtown Aquarium, Houston, was served with a notice for animal abuse concerning the \"deplorable\" living conditions of the housed tigers, which are members of an endangered species.)\nStingray Reef allows you to get up close and personal with the stingrays. For a small fee, you are able to feed the stingrays as well as touch them.\n\n\n== Other attractions ==\nShark Voyage, a 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge C.P. Huntington train ride, tours the entire property and stops in the center of a 200,000-US-gallon (760,000 l) shark habitat to let visitors watch and learn about the sharks. The shark habitat viewed from the train is in a separate building from the main aquarium. This train is actually the first electric-run CP Huntington train.Other facilities on the aquarium property include two restaurants, a bar, and banquet facilities in the main building; and the Diving Bell Ferris Wheel and an aquatic-themed carousel outside. One of the restaurants includes a 110,000-US-gallon (420,000 l) centerpiece aquarium which is the largest cylindrical tank in the United States.There are two additional rides; Lighthouse Dive, a Drop tower ride and a Frog Hopper ride for younger children. The facility also features carnival-styled games.\n\n\n== Incidents & Accidents ==\nOn July 12, 2009, two miniature trains collided in the loading area. According to officials one train hit the back of the other, forcing two cars off the track. 31 people were injured and 27 were taken to the hospital. Nobody was seriously injured, and there was minimal damage to the trains.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSchwartz, Matt; Rachel Graves (2001-03-07). \"Council approves lease for Landry's aquarium center\".

          "Looking at the prices compared to what you actually get for it, I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. We went because it was included in our CityPASS. What we saw was nice but this is a \u201cfor profit\u201d aquarium. Most of them are in tanks too small for them. Their poor bengal",
          "I would not waste my money coming to this aquarium. It is super small super fast from start to finish last about ten minutes . Have been to the one in Corpus and San Antonio this rates way at the bottom . Waste of money and they really need to expand . The tanks are very small",
          "This is the smallest aquarium I have ever seen. Cool exhibits, but where is the rest? They were doing construction, so I am hoping that they are planning to expand. The exhibits they did have were good, but the white tiger looked like he was sedated. I was wondering why the gift",

          "We only did the tour of the Aquarium Exhibit museum to see all the fish and the tiger. This does not cover the play areas and rides. Nice museum with really good signage and lots and lots of fish of all types. I used a DSLR camera with auto ISO (no flash) and got terrific",
          "Having bought the Houston CityPass, we decided to drop down to the Aquarium. We parked a short walk away (free street parking - valid on Sunday). It was an enjoyable stroll around the aquarium which hosted a diverse range of animals including personal favourites - Bengal tigers.",

I think we spent a total of an hour here. It\u2019s very small. There are small amusement rides outside that",

          "So many fish to view. We loved petting the stingrays. Not sure why there are tigers in an aquarium....",
          "This is probably the worst aquarium we've ever been in. They have a few nice fish displays. Half the building is taken up with the tiger exhibit. The three top floors are just resteraunt and bar. Many of the tanks are cloudy.",
          "We went there with our kids because we had an afternoon to spend. The Aquarium is nice but the highlite by far is the shark exhibit which you enter by train - very cool! They also have a white tiger in a pretty exhibition.",
          "The aquarium is on the small side and the pricing model a bit annoying but understandable considering the size. For the size it can be expensive for what is offered. I feel like this aquarium is mainly geared towards small kids. There are a few rides (6) outside and each ride",

          "I took my two granddaughters, ages 7 and 8, to the Aquarium this summer right before school started and they had a great time. They loved both the exhibits and the outside amusement park rides. I had never been to the aquarium before and was a little surprised that it wasn\u2019t",

          "Parking is a challenge in a very congested/confined area of downtown (probably better off using valet parking out front), but once inside the aquarium it's great. Kids get to touch a sting ray with the stinger removed so no one gets hurt. There's a good variety of aquatic life",
          "I have been to an aquarium in just about every city we visit and have seen some amazing ones. This is far from what I would even call an aquarium. To start off everything other than the five feet of regular aquarium coats extra. So they nickel and dime you for their little",

There was ray feeding area where you could buy 4 small fish for USD3, and the rays felt like they were starved, didn\u2019t give off good vibes. The",

          "So you know how many aquariums are layed out to be very sleek, elegant, and rather minimalistic? The Downtown Aquarium in Houston isn't like that at all. The whole interior of the building was designed to look look like the belly of a pirate ship and it accentuated the exhibits",
          "Tickets were a bit pricey, wish the aquarium had more to see, personally would have hoped the start to end to be more the 10 mins of sea life. Just cause I've neen to better aquariums for the same price, overall pretty decent. Beautiful views outside at night, ferris wheel will",
          "The aquarium is nice and clean but wow it\u2019s small and for 45 dollars fir 2 adults and a 12 year old who we had to pay full price for . We took our time and were still done and dusted in 45 minutes . Rip off",
          "We visited on a busy Saturday but had a great experience. The Ferris wheel and the shark train was our favorite!",
          "Came here today while visiting Houston with a friend. Was good and had lots of different fish and snakes. And a white tiger at the end. Didn't have as much as I thought it would but still good to see.",
          "Went with a toddler who had a very nice time. It is small but the exhibits are well done and very kid friendly. The variety of fish, reptiles and tigers is unusual but nice. The tram tour with the sharks swimming right next to us was exciting and informative except some of it",
          "The Aquarium is a great day trip for the family. The exhibit is beautiful. Rides were an added plus that the kids really enjoyed.",
          "I was a bit disappointed to learn just how small this Aquarium is! Having visited many aquariums, in multiple cities that are smaller than Houston, I was expecting more. Though the price is not terrible, we were expecting a bit more for our money. We were done quickly and",
          "It took us less than 15 minutes to walk through the entire Aquarium. Not worth paying for, however it was included with our CityPass tickets. Probably more worth it if you have small children and make use of the rides.",
          "For sure the smallest aquarium I\u2019ve been too.. best for kids who are younger, but i don\u2019t recommend to people actually wanting to be wowed. Shark voyage train was cute. However, only about 3 minutes to look at the sharks. They have a very depressed tiger cooped up in there as",
          "a quit small aquarium with some nice fishes - outside they have a amusement park for kids with is included in the entrance fee",
          "The aquarium though not the biggest, has really nice and well put together exhibits. The little amusement park rides outside make for a fun addition to your experience. The train ride through the shark tank tunnel is really unique. And don\u2019t forget the top notch restaurant",
          "This is a super place to visit while in downtown Houston. If you have small kids, then get there early and get the all day, all rides pass. The indoor part takes about an hour or less to see and then the rides and shark train await you. The shark train is the absolute",
          "Have never seen such an interesting setup of marine life inside. The magnified glass if aquarium added an awesome vibe aling with the music and lights. Will definitely have to start visiting these in other cities now. Food was pretty good in the restaurant also. Get the all day",
          "You can sit to eat and watch huge fish of all type swing in an extra large indoor tank. The food is very good for a non name brand restaurant. We are mostly seafood but they have everything. Good for family trip, kids and adults love to stand and stare at the fish. There are",
          "Good fun for the family. However some of the best exhibits need to be paid for on top of basic ticket. Good rides.",
          "We had lunch here with my husband, son and his wife. We all absolutely loved looking around the Aquarium and the food was fabulous. It was a Sat. and there were a lot of kids there so it was a little noisy. Service was great and we would definitely eat there again. We do live",
          "We went with 4 children ages 4 to 15. Thank goodness we had the CityPASS because I would have requested a refund if I paid full price. While the facility was decorated very nice it was incredibly small and they wanted extra money for everything. We were done in under a half",
          "I enjoyed a late lunch in the restaurant with a huge Aquarium surrounding the dining area. I got the all day pass to make sure I seen all of the attractions and was very disappointed. There was only 1 white tiger that slept the entire visit. The train ride was the best part of",
          "we loved the aquarium, very affordable so much to see . loved the sharks . the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable! we enjoyed petting the sting rays , my girls stayed there for a long time watching them swim . only drawback the food prices were a little much for a family",
          "The kids absolutely loved the atmosphere and the fish swimming around while we eat. Everything was fantastic we started with the Castaway Combo for and appetizer. The dip is amazing. My wife and I had the shrimp enbrochettes and the Broiled Fishermans Platter, they both were",
          "It\u2019s a nice aquarium but definitely the biggest or best I\u2019ve been to. But, if you are with kids I would say you should go. They are definitely super kid oriented with lots of rides and fun activities.",
          "I took my 5 yr-old son here and it was so interactive and we both had an amazing time. We ate at the restaurant that looks like you're in the water. He loved it!",
          "We have been to several different aquariums and it is refreshing to see that you won't see the same old fish whenever you go to an aquarium. As before, we saw new fish species, amphibians and reptiles that were new to us. And the white Bengal Tiger was a first for us as well.",
          "We enjoyed the aquarium we got the all day pass, they had rides to offer and guys painting cool pictures of couples",
          "This aquarium is not necessarily your typical aquarium. It has attractions outside that you can ride, as well as some animals like snakes and white tigers! The 20$ all day pass is worth it as you get to do anything you want. Also this was the best place to pet stingrays I\u2019ve",
          "The food here is just average, at best. And the fact that rare white tigers are kept in captivity in the catacombs of this restaurant without ever seeing the outside world takes my appetite away.",
          "I love that place, is a good place to go with family! I have been there for almost 4 hour's and like so much.",
          "There are a lot of different types of fish and snakes to view. Also the white lions are very pretty. Outside there are a lot of things to do...train ride, Ferris wheel, games, etc. in the summer it is very hot! There is also a very nice restaurant.",
          "I took my 2 children here on a Saturday afternoon\u2014 13 months and 6 years old. First of all, buying tickets is an ordeal and kind of a nightmare. You can buy a ticket for JUST the aquarium, but if you have kids they will see all of the rides and you\u2019ll end up buying a day pass",
          "Its soooo tiny. Cute if you go very early on a weekday low season! It was claustrophobic inside crazyyyyyy packed and its so tiny i really couldnt believe thats all the fish they have. Shouldnt be called aquarium, just randomness park might be better. Its cute for younger kids",
          "Got the CityPass and this was included if it wouldn't have been I wouldn't have wasted my money. This aquarium has to be the worst aquarium I have ever visited and I've been to quite a few. Took my Family and I 35 minutes to view everything in the aquarium. There are no signs",
          "recommend going here. It is small but has lots to see, and is not overpriced. Kids will love it, especially the stingray petting area.",
          "I'm not impressed with the high prices and lack of aquatic animals at this aquarium. I love Tillman Fetita, but not a fan of this tiny for profit business they call an aquarium",
          "We had 3 adults and 6 kids and the general admission price was ridiculous it included nothing. We wanted to see sharks and you pay extra to do that. City pass is a freakin joke!",
          "If this is your first aquarium then you may walk away with a different opinion. I have been to numerous aquariums and this one just didn't do it for me. My first complaint was that you had to wait outside in the sun to purchase tickets. They really should have had the box",
          "We visited The Aquarium on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn\u2019t overly crowded but in my opinion The Aquarium is small with one short walk through to see the sea life animal and a few ride options outside. The Shark Voyage was the best experience while there. It was an experience",
          "I took my daughter to the aquarium for lunch before a day of fun. The food was great my daughter had the shrimp and fries. My daughter was cold during lunch which is my own fault because I should of taken her a jacket. It is cold in the resturant so be prepared. After lunch we",
          "I have visited the Aquarium with some friends two weeks ago; we had a good time; it is a little be small; I will recommend to add some additional interactions as the one they have with devil-rays; they keep the aquarium well maintenance and clean",
          "Don't go here for the food - it's less than average. We ordered drinks once after we were seated at our tables. They didn't arrive until after we had finished our meals. It reminds me of a stop on a tour bus. You know, the ones that include an \"authentic\" meal but it turns out",
          "I love going to the aquarium for mother's day it is my fourth visit and I enjoyed every year they always outdo themselves with the cuisine. It is such an array of food to appeal to all types of appetites. It is my mother's day dream.",
          "Was really small. Not much to see and I don\u2019t feel there was adequate signage to point out what fish or animals reside in each exhibit. The place is crazy tiny. Maybe we\u2019re spoiled by living so close to Baltimore and Camden Aquariums, which are considerably better than this one.",
          "I was trying to find something we hadn't done before that would be enjoyable for the entire family, great grandparents to children. We really enjoyed ourselves while we were there. I had read that it was too small and disappointing, but I found it to be perfect for us. We rode",
          "We were in town visiting family and decided to eat lunch and enjoy the aquarium. It was my wife and I,two teenage boys and our granddaughter. Everyone had a blast. Food was delicious and scenery was even better. The service was below par but The manager was quick to fix the",
          "This was an impromptu visit. We got the pass for all exhibits and was more economical versus buying a few. The Ferris wheel view was great! The stingray exhibit was fun, if you don\u2019t mind touching them, but be prepared to get the front of your shirt a little wet. The outdoor",
          "We had a great time visiting this aquarium but I think the Dallas aquarium is a bit better. No fault of the aquarium but there were a lot of summer camp tours the day we were there so it was incredibly loud.",
          "Day pass works great for family with kid(s). All of the tanks are bigger than them, the tunnel train is exciting watching sharks swim above and around, the carousel is included for as many rides as they want and the ferris wheel. Draw attention to details, there's plenty",
          "Ok this isn\u2019t the most amazing aquarium, but it\u2019s pretty good! Look if you\u2019ve been to the Georgia Aquarium then this place can\u2019t compete, but in downtown Houston this is a great place to spend a few hours (maybe 2-3 at most)! There are some very large floor to ceiling tanks,",
          "I went to the main exhibit because I had the Houston City Pass (which I highly reccomend!) which included it, but I probably wouldn't bother with the Aquarium otherwise. It was pretty, but not fantastic, and the white tigers being inside seemed kind of cruel. Their enclosure",
          "If this is the only aquarium that you have available and ever see it\u2019s probably not too bad. However, if not then I would rate it as one of the ten worst I\u2019ve even seen. It\u2019s smaller than most. The biggest thing going for it is the carnival like play ground out back that cost",
          "Not that exciting. Took about 1 hr to walk through and view everything. 2 of the four rides were not working and they failed to mention that when we were given the option of paying the additional cost to have unlimited access to the rides. Had it not been a part of the City",
          "It was a good way to get in out of the rain. Unless you really really study each fish, you are done in less than an hour (a little dull). The price was ok. The white tiger was interesting (not awesome).",
          "If you visit with children and families, then the package tickets are the way to go. It is best valued when bundled with the city pass. The aquarium alone leaves a bit to be desired, and the individual prices seem to be purposefully nickle-and-dime. If you want your children to",
          "This like a seafood restaurant with an adjoining carnival ride sideshow. As an older person, I found it entertaining to walk around, but practically the carnival part is made more for kids and young adults. One exception is the tall Ferris Wheel that allows one to get a great",
          "Food here is not good at all... It's like a little playground for kids and for what you get for what you pay don't think it's that great at all",
          "The restaurant is beautiful and our daughter loved all of the fish. But we found the food to be overpriced and the parking fees also high. The food wasn\u2019t bad, but it wasn\u2019t that great considering what we paid for it.",
          "I should have read the 1 Star reviews before going to this place. I see hundreds of people shared my same experience in that we thought it was a prank that it only took 10-15 minutes to walk through this aquarium which cost an entire $20 to enter. THE ENTIRE AQUARIUM ONLY TAKES",
          "In comparison with other aquariums this one is just ok. The highlight of the visit was the white tigers.",
          "We brought our 1 year old and met with another couple we hadn't seen in a while. The food was delicious and our daughter LOVED looking at the fish tank. My only bother was that the booth we were sat at was SO dark and with not that many people in there at the time we were sat",
          "Don\u2019t waste your money. This was a glorified fish tank. I could\u2019ve went to pet smart and received the same experience. Towards the end they have a white tiger. The tiger was cool but I didn\u2019t understand why he would be at an aquarium. The only cool thing I saw was one of the",
          "White Tigers and Alligators and HUGE aquariums of exotic fish and sharks. A restaurant and some rides. The outdoor restroom near the rides was clean and has some of the most beautiful tile on the floor. The white tiger exhibit is exciting and you can see them up close. Don\u2019t",
          "The housing area for the tigers here was completely inadequate and they just paced up and down. Our party of 6 adults were all Disgusted and left. totally shocked by the amount of idiots who thought it was awesome.",
          "It was raining the day we went so all of the outdoor activities were closed but inside is so small. It took us maybe a half hour to see everything. Not a good aquarium.",
          "This was quite a good place to attend but smaller than we had expected although the fun fair part seemed to be more popular. Would have liked more staff around to interact with and learn more about the fish etc there and how and why they needed to preserve them. Some of the",
          "The first time my family and I went was to play with stingrays. We enjoyed it so much, we try to go each year. The children love interacting with the marine life. This year we also spent time out on the carnival/play area. Great for the family, especially after the other",
          "Absolutely horrified with this Aquarium, we queued for ages to get in even though there were only 3 families in front of us. The tanks for the fish were far too small, some of the varieties of fish were huge yet the tank was so small there was no where for them to swim. We",
          "We visited the Aquarium over the holiday. I was expecting it to be very busy but it really was not. I was expecting the Aquarium to be a little bigger than it was but it was still nice & very clean. The price was a little high in my opinion but I ended up getting a coupon on",
          "We visited the aquarium on Good Friday. Glad I bought the City Pass because I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the $20 admission price. With the City pass we were able to view the aquarium and stingrays. The stingrays are super active and love to be touched and fed. All in all, it took us",
          "Worst aquarium I've been to! Super small, hardly any exhibits,everything costs extra. Not worth the money, definitely wouldn't go back.",
          "The environment and habitat in which the fishes are placed is really nice. I was sad we didn\u2019t get to see the sharks but besides that it was perfect! We even got to see a pregnant seahorse. About feeding the stingrays, it\u2019s so much fun we had a good time and couldn\u2019t stop",
          "The Aquarium is very nice, My daughter enjoy all the water animals and the tiger. The Rides are excellent",
          "Once I figured out where the descriptions where life was good. My motherwho is in a whee chair had a good time. Some of the exhibits were tall forthe wheel chair height mom nevercomplained. So she enjoyec.",
          "The Aquarium is a very interesting place. It not only has sea animals to view but also a restaurant which makes you feel like you are dining underwater! The food was good, staff was amazing...even helping us with other interesting places to visit in Houston. Another",
          "Our troop went here for our December/Christmas event. We started with Breakfast with Santa. This really is you doing an all you can eat buffet style breakfast while Santa bounces around inside the aquarium in the middle of the room with one of his elves. It was cool idea but",
          "Really nice though very small. Restaurant a little pricey but very nice view of the fishes while you eat. My kids enjoyed it.",
          "Even though it was small, the marine water systems were exciting to view because of the vivid sea life which enclosed all small and tall visitors. Same with the outside amusement rides.",
          "We always enjoy a play date with family and friends at this place. The aquarium is nice and we didn\u2019t realize how many fish they lost during Hurricane Harvey.,They have rebuilt well. The carnival was great and the kids enjoyed the rides, games and face painting, train ride,",
          "Nice small place!! Many different fish than other aquariums, little hammerheads, electric eels, and even a white tiger!",
          "This place was like walking on the ocean floor seeing all the fish swim by. The outside rides weren\u2019t open but we fed the stingrays. That was cool and a little creepy.",
          "Hey it is really cool, my wife and I went on a Saturday, it was sunny, humid and super fun. We had a blast with my, but you could see some people annoyed with the noise and kids, so I recommend you not to go during the weekend if you do not like kids being kids.",
          "Went with a big group of family, young kids and pre teens, and absolutely love and recommend this place! Affordable and lots to see and do. Pet the sting rays, rode the train & other rides, and saw all the cool aquarium life and even a white tiger. Restaurant is really expensive",
          "Huh! Never expected it to be really so small. We went with our 2 year old kid. He really loves fishes. So we decided to take him. But to my disappointment we were out in half an hour\u2019s time. They have a good variety of fish population and a white lion but the aquarium main",
          "Centrally locatednin downtown Houston with the Ferris wheel ride basically touching I45. We went right around sunset so pretty cool watching the sunset and cars move along. The food was ok I thought that it would have been little better but wasn\u2019t horrible. Service was great",
          "I took two 13 year old girls for the afternoon and they loved it. We saw the aquarium\u2014small but nice and well done. We bought a ride pass and they rode everything once and the shark train twice. The big hit was the baby stingray tank. We bought tiny fish to feed the stingrays",
          "Restaurant is beautiful. Service is great. Food is good. Great place to go with young children. You can take the kids to the rides and visit the restaurant afterwards. Highly recommended \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Nice, fairly small aquarium. Specimens are well displayed. The stingray reef, with \u201ctouch\u201d is a nice feature. The shark voyage (extra and outside) is a nice touch, as is the Ferris wheel. The white tiger display is excellent. The restaurant is another matter. Happy hour is a",
          "The food was delicious. The acquarium has nice fish and a variety of rare species, however it was a bit small. WIsh the tigers had room to roam around on the outside.",
          "We went here as part of the City Pass. It\u2019s clean and what they have is nice but just the aquarium itself is small. If you add the all day pass, it\u2019s nicer as there are some rides and the stingrays.",
          "Ambiance is nice but old school restaurant Food is good. A little pricy but the fish tank experience make it worthy",
          "Great For families lotta fun fun things to do the train ride for the sharks was great definitely like",
          "Good place to visit with young kids because it\u2019s relatively small ... not too much to cover with young kids. Some fun outside activities including train ride, carousel and games.",
          "We arrived in Houston, to find this little place stays open until 8:30pm which was good for us since we arrived in Houston @4pm..it still gave the kids something to do to get Spring break started. The White striped tiger was a treat. It was just large enough for the kids to",
          "Went to the aquarium with our grown children and 18 month old granddaughter. We only did the aquarium since she was too little to enjoy the rides. Aquarium is nicely done though not overly large. Highlight was viewing feeding time for the white tiger at the end which was a",
          "We paid $60 for aquarium entrance and the train ride for two adults and a child. We spent less than an hour there, which is basically a dollar a minute!!!! The aquarium itself is tiny and there was very little room to maneuver with the amount of people on there. The tiger",
          "This place has very few exhibits. It is not worth the price at all. There were long lines for the 3 or 4 rides available. Don't waste your money here.",
          "Took my kids here. Visited the restaurant upstairs first, which was really fun. Then waited 20 minutes to get in line, then paid around $40 for 3 tickets. The aquarium is literally 4ish rooms and a total cattle drive. This reminds me of the Sea Life aquarium in Grapevine, TX.",
          "I'm glad this was included with the CityPass, because otherwise it was rather disappointing for two seniors and their daughter. Granted it was March Break and it would be good for families with children, but with the extra parking fees I felt it was totally not worth it.",
          "My spouse and I visited the aquarium during our vacation to Houston. It was included in the CityPass. Parking was an additional $8. It was crowded because of spring break (which we expected). We walked through at a leisurely pace checking out the tanks, and we were surprised to",
          "Parking is $8, $10 for valet (if open). We ate dinner and the food ia a bit pricey BUT it was GOOD and you got to sit a few feet from the huge tank in the middle of the resturant! My kids didnt even get on their phinea during dinner bc they were so engrossed in watching fiah",
          "My kids had a great time, when we went there it was almost empty they where able to watch with a lot of time and no rush every single tank. We pet the stingray which was a very unusual experience.",
          "Houston aquarium is set up like a micro amusement park. They have a train ride to other buildings, a ferris wheel and outdor areas to play in. Was pretty cold out when we were there so we did not venture outdoors. Aquarium was nice - interesting way to decorate it- seaweed",
          "My kids were awed by the colorful fish and the large tank and the various scenery inside and outside the restaurant. The food is nothing special. I give it a rating of 3.5 to 4. Their menu is geared towards the younger generation as my taste and food selection has changed with",
          "We visited downtown aquarium for in a week afternoon, and when we bought our entrance tickets, they gave us free admission tickets to the stingray pond, where you can touch and feed the stingrays. It's really beautiful, but quite small, I was hoping to see more exhibitions. And,",
          "The Aquarium has always been a fun place for the family to visit. We've been there for a family fun day as well as a date night without the kiddos. The food is excellent and the service is outstanding. We have even attended several company functions there ranging from 12",
          "I enjoyed watching all of the amazing fish swim around while I had lunch. The gumbo was delicious, as where the fish tacos. This is the perfect place for people of all ages.",
          "I was somewhat disappointed that the size of the aquarium. It provides entertainment for families and there are enjoyable sites and things to do there. The train ride was very interesting. We spent approximately two and a half hours there. I was somewhat disappointed.",
          "We brought our two-year-old granddaughter here for a visit. She loved all the exhibits. I appreciated that most of the displays were low to the ground so she could see in, or had a ledge she could sit on. The stingrays were so tame! They came right up to the surface to be",
          "We took our son here and he had a blast the food was great and the beers were ice cold I would come back for more",
          "I have visited many aquariums both in the US and Europe, this is by far the worst. The tanks for fish are extremely undersized for the size and quantity of fish in each tank. As for the poor white tigers, they where inside with no day light and looked out of sorts. Very",
          "I have been to several aquariums in the US before, and whilst a lot has been done to make this interactive and interesting for kids, it was very disappointing and small. Some tanks were adequately sized, but many were very small for the number and size of fishes in them. The",
          "Unfortunately I have to range this place very poor! We were been around 5 years ago but my opinion it hasn\u2019t been changed. For a big city like Houston I don\u2019t understand why the Aquarium is so small and poor. Another thing that I don\u2019t understand is the white tiger at the end of",
          "Excellent exhibition plus rides for the kids at an affordable price. 2-3 hrs of entertainment on a slow day.",
          "This is a wonderful little aquarium with many types of sea life in an area manageable for all ages. It\u2019s a particularly great venue for children with rides for the little ones. The attached restaurant serves plentiful quality food with an enormous fish tank visible from every",
          "Many great exhibits and things to do for all ages, Grandkids range from 10 to 2, and we all had a great time. Parking downtown was not too bad and worth the visit.",
          "We went here with my wife's family when they came to visit and they loved it. Our daughters have been talking about it ever since we left and look forward to going back there again one day. Very knowledgeable and interactive",
          "This place is great except for the White Tigers that are forced to live in a tiny habitat . I have to say I will never go back here, those Tigers need to be set free.",
          "I stopped at the Houston zoo on a whim as we needed something to do for a couple of hours. Talked to the ticket sales staff and asked what was going on. They said the zoo was real exciting today and La La La. Paid our 29.90, walked around to find most exhibits closed or under",
          "This is a great place. The food was good and the service was first rate. The staff was friendly, attentive and efficient. The other good thing is the location. It is a good place to introduce new visitors to the city.",
          "This place is quite a site to see! If you can afford to eat in their restaurant then do, they have great food and your surrounded by a huge fish aquarium. It's quite an experience to see all different sized fish swimming right next to you. They have a nice bar if you want to",
          "I visited this place for my birthday while in downtown Houston it was a short walk from my hotel I loved all the attractions and it\u2019s all the staff was very friendly",
          "I went a group of friends to the aquarium for our \"touristy Tuesday.\" When we got there I can say it was not very busy, so that was a plus, but it did seem to underwhelm. We were finished with the viewing of most everything in less then an hour. We did not pay extra to go see",
          "After visiting the Denver aquarium, we decided to visit our hometown one. What a disappointment. Like others have said, EVERY fish and ALL of the tigers look depressed in their surroundings. The tanks and cages are much too small for the creatures. We did get to touch a",
          "We were so excited to check out the aquarium and were extremely disappointed with the experience. There are a few fish to look at, and we were waiting to see some larger fish/more of the aquarium and all of a sudden we were in the gift shop at the end. I had to ask an employee",
          "We had the city pass. So we decided to go there. First off never found where to redeem them. The park was not free. It is a good concept but failed on me.. If you want to do dinner and date it might be a nice place to do it but it is there to take you money with no real",
          "The aquarium itself is very poor with fish, reptiles and spiders. Snakes in small cases with plastic foiliage. A few fish. Worst of all the white tigers kept in a totally unsuitable habitat, no outside space and only concrete. This actually reduced me to tears, I wish I had read",
          "Small and underwhelming would be the most apt description. Great for kids as they would get to see everything and you would still have plenty of time do other things in the day. We went through it in under an hour. The white Bengal Tigers were probably the most interessting",
          "We combined it with dinner there and it was really fun. Try to go not on weekends and make a reservation ahead if possible. There is a little outside amusement park. You can make pics driving through the shark tunnel. Good food and drinks, but be aware on the pricey side, but",
          "Every fish tank was immaculately clean with crystal clear water. All of the fish and other wildlife looked healthy and vibrant.... maybe except that huge eel that was hiding. We got the full pass, rode the train, ferris wheel, and merry go round. Great for kids 3-15. You can do",
          "I went with HIGH expectations and left very disappointed. When you go expect to hand them your wallet . This place was expensive and over rated. My five year old had fun with the fish displays but as a parent I found it to be too expensive for the return of fun and food.",
          "We spent several hours here, walking though the kind of small aquarium exhibit, riding the rides, feeding the rays, and enjoying a fabulous dinner. The tank in the restaurant was really the highlight of the visit, as well as the shark tunnel/train ride that cost extra.",
          "The sea life exhibits are excellent and the staff very friendly and courteous. Plan on at least 3 hours for this attraction, and it is pricey. Casual dress is appropriate",
          "We were visiting Houston, and went here with the children. We had such a great time! This is an Aquarium and mini Amusement Park in one. There were all kinds of rides, gift shop and a resturant all in one location. My children just loved visiting here. Definitely a must do in",
          "My family had been coming here for NYE dinner for over a decade. The food was soooo good! It has the aquarium, which keeps our 10yo entertained. We ordered off the new menu and I totally recommend the stuffed poblano and the Chipotle seafood pasta.",
          "I was not at all impressed with this place. Sad aquarium, overpriced food and the setting in the restaurant was not that nice. I was surprised they didn\u2019t try to charge for using the restroom. I would not go back here and don\u2019t be fooled by the term \u201caquarium\u201d",
          "Not worth the money. The whole aquarium is very dark, tight corridors where it\u2019s impossible to move through when there is a crowd. Exhibits were just ok, but not really many. Moody Gardens is a better choice. Over priced. Parking is expensive and it just wasn\u2019t good.",
          "Nice place to visit with family. In winter this place is bit cold but especially in late evening so avoid going with young children in late evening.",
          "Ok so I decided to go check out the aquarium since I was in Downtown Houston. The gate fee is about $20 or slightly more. The parking is $8-10 depending on if you self park or valet park. The rides are all extra. So let\u2019s go in to the aquarium. I went in and I came out. All in",
          "Our sister has terminal cancer and we took her there for dinner. Worse meal ever. Shrimp overcooked and kitchen was closing so the waitress couldn't offer a different meal choice. However, we were not offered anything for compensation either. We will never go back or recommend",
          "This is a nice aquarium with outdoor rides/activities as well. Lots to do/see for kids and adults. If you plan to visit museums, the Zoo and the Space Center, you should definitely look into the CityPass.",
          "Went to this because it was part of City Pass. You see it all in under 30 mins and it ends with a live, white tiger stuck in an interior enclosure with no windows. The place should be shut down for cruelty to such a beautiful cat. Amusement rides not worth it either because",
          "I highly recommend. We could not have had a better time! The grandkids were completely into all the exhibits and the fun train ride. The restaurants are also excellent!",
          "It was just ok to me. But my grandchildren loved it. I would suggest trying to go on a week day and not in the summer.",
          "Easily the worst aquarium we have ever been too. Overpriced for such a tiny aquarium - would be more reasonable if some of the outdoor attractions were included in admission. Through the entire place in less than 20 minutes. Even in comparison to other smaller sized aquariums,",
          "It was an average aquarium. It was relatively small. But it was still nice to visit. It was worth the stop in on the cold rainy day. They do have white tigers which is neat. They were sleeping while we were there.",
          "This place is just amazing went for the first time back in July and it was just lovely kids loved it, definitely going back",

          "It is a nice small aquarium with interesting species. Downside is definitely that some fish have no info about them at all, or just a name with nothing else. It's really more of a place to bring your kids to see pretty fish than to actually go to extend your water life knowledge.",

          "I visited here because I had a spare morning, and it was some years since I had visited an aquarium anywhere. I was shocked and saddened to see some of the conditions - tiny spaces for large animals such as snakes that seemed unable to stretch out to full length. Some of the",

          "Not worth the money. Very small and packed with people. It is dark inside also. Probably due to we visited many aquariums before so this one to us is not in good design. However you still can see many different kind of tropical fish. All ride is for small kids so do not even",
          "We went as part of the City Pass. Family with kids 3, 9 & 14. We paid $6 extra per person to ride all the rides. It was raining and they had to shut down the rides. Parking was another $8. We rode the Farris wheel, the train and carousel. Then we went inside to see the aquarium.",
          "The exhibits were small and there weren\u2019t that many. A random white tiger at the end? And the gift shop prices were incredibly high. Shark exhibit was apparently extra. It\u2019s an aquarium that should have been included. Stingrays were also extra. Definitely will never return and",
          "Visited with anticipation. I was quite disappointed with the number of exhibits. I expected more. What was there was good but the zoo had so much more. So in my opinion this was an anticlimax. The space per exhibit was quite small too. I wasn\u2019t there for the fun rides so",
          "My family enjoyed the Downtown Aquarium because it had something to engage everyone, from the very young kids, to the teens, to the older adults. It is a family friendly facility that keeps everyone entertained and actively engaged for a good half day. From the Aquarium itself,",
          "We frequent Landry\u2019s businesses on the regular and Downtown Aquarium is my daughters favorite. We recently had a not so stellar visit. I filled out my Landry\u2019s email review that they send after every visit when we remember to use our Landry\u2019s card explaining the issue. Within a",
          "We look forward to this and went with my entire family Young and old\u2026 We waited for many many minutes at least 15 minutes for someone to actually come to the window and let us pay to come in no one actually came so we just walked in and gave ourselves our own tour. We were",
          "Having visited other city aquariums. We felt this one a bit tired. The are some big tanks and a diversity of fish. You can get very close to the white tiger but he looked sad in his concrete enclosure. Wouldn\u2019t recommend a visit just for the aquarium part unless you\u2019re keen or",
          "It is a nice place for fish lovers. For a change it also had a white tiger at the Maharajah temple. There is a section where in kids and visitors can touch and spend time with Sting rays at the Reef.",
          "I think this is primarily a restaurant with huge aquarium features inside, but it also has a small train outside that encircles the property. It was developed by the Landry's Seafood chain which has about 600 restaurants nationwide last time I heard. The seafood is quite good",
          "Great aquarium small but organized city pass will get charged $6 per person for rides if you want to do them good for familys of all ages",
          "There are 4 rides, 2 rides that drop you down 1 merry-go-round, 1 Ferris wheel and 1 train, 1 indoor mini aquarium/zoo. 1 wading pool with stingrays. There is also a restaurant.It is good just very small.",
          "Not overly impressed. From the very start and upon arrival, parking was challenging with onsite parking unavailable, having to hunt for parking then pay additional costs were less than ideal. Upon trying to obtain an entrance pass, we were met with hundreds of people trying to",
          "This \"aquarium\" is appalling. Not only are the fish crowded into tiny tanks but they have bred 2 white tigers for the public to gawk at. They sit in a small room with no access to the outdoors. What a sad and depressing life for such majestic apex predators. I contacted PETA on",
          "And use the Groupon for $99 for four full access tickets plus $50 credit at the restaurant and it we worth a full day out with your pre teen and under kids...",
          "We came for a birthday party with children under six and arrived before 10 am when it opened. The splash pad was working so we hung out there until we could purchase a day wristband.. We purposefully dressed them in bathing suits and water shoes for the splash pad which were",
          "Thought was worth the money even though it didn\u2019t take long to do the full tour. Was nice to see different species we don\u2019t see in the aquariums in the UK. Bit weird having the white tigers at the end of the tour. Enjoyed feeding the rays at the end of the tour and also the",
          "The weather was nice and we were headed to the Zoo, however it was too crowded to find a parking spot. As we were headed home we passed the Aquarium and decided to stop there instead. Rode the Farris Wheel and then had an awesome steak and lobster dinner. It was a wonderful",
          "Well I personally have been to bigger and better aquariums in other states. In my opinion, the downtown aquarium is a rip-off because you have to pay to view other attractions inside AFTER you have already paid for general admission. You must pay for any rides you get on.",
          "What can I say other than AWESOME !!! Fantastic lunch with shrimp and scallops tempura with a side of tempura fried asparagus. Top notch aquarium and swamp display. White tiger is beautiful and has a beautiful habitat. Train ride and much more. Spend the day and have a blast",
          "Not the best aquarium I\u2019ve been too. But has some fun stuff. The sting rays are cool. Buy food and feed them but be ready to get splashed.",
          "Not worth the time (all 20 minutes of it), and certainly not worth the cost. $12 admission and $8 parking. There is just too little to see.",
          "The aquarium and fish are absolutely gorgeous, just take your time walking through. Not sure who thought the tiger at the end was appropriate though it is beautiful. There was an area outside at the end with kiddie rides that we did not explore as it was very crowded. The",
          "Very small aquarium in the centre of the city. Had to pay $12 to park, then took about 20 minutes to walk through the entire exhibition. White tiger seems to be the highlight, and although it is impressive to see you can't help but feel sorry for it. Shark tunnel costs extra and",
          "Avoid! What a waste of time and money. We walked through in 30 minutes. My disappointed daughter said the animals looked sad and depressed. If you want to really do something wonderful with your family go to the Natural Science Museum and spend the entire day.",
          "For the first 3/4 of the aquarium I was so excited and pleased. The aquariums are beautiful, and the fish look healthy and happy. Then, we rounded a corner, and in a concrete cage were two white tigers. They were pacing incessantly and had sore red eyes. The picture I attached",
          "Don't waste your money. It was small and the people running stingray reef are ignorant and unprofessional. We were told immediately to wash our hands and told how to feed the stingrays yet the couple behind us were allowed to walk in and just stuck their hands into the exhibit.",
          "We were looking for something to do before flying home. Parking is $8 in a covered area next to the aquarium. The aquarium part was neat, its pretty cool how they have it set up. Stingrays feeding area is a bit stinky but the people loved feeding and touching the rays. Food",
          "I recently visited with my mother, my mother-in-law, my 2 young sons (4 &1) and my niece (3). Parking it $8, and they only accept cash. We stayed about 3 1/2 hours. I found a Groupon deal that was 4 All-Day Adventure passes (unlimited rides and all-day access to exhibit and",
          "They have the cutest restaurant I got to feed stingray we enjoyed happy hour. They have beautiful white tigger. You should also get the on the train very informational",
          "Looks are deceiving! What an amazing attraction! You don\u2019t realise what is behind the Las Vegas type facade, but your kids will love it!",
          "Stopped in to the attraction while walking around downtown Houston on a recent trip. If you have little kids, this is the place to take them. if you're two adults, this is not the place for you. The aquarium itself is very small with your everyday exhibits, nothing special here",
          "Met with friends for Friday night dinner. Great spot for groups or a late night date with your boo. I say late night because I can only imagine the amount of kids present during the day. Menu has everything you could ask for at a seafood restaurant. Food was ok, nothing to",
          "I took some of the kids from church, and they love it! The amusement park outside, the petting and feeding the fish inside The active learners, loved the information reading for each displayed. Well designed, and well loved.",
          "My girlfriend and I went to the aquarium while in town on business. We were really looking forward to it and fought our way there through traffic. Being a Thursday evening the aquarium wasn\u2019t very busy. The displays inside were nice and they had a decent variety of fish,",
          "Love to go to the aquarium, good food, fun for kids and love the aquariums in the restraunt. Have had wedding lunches, and romantic dinners. Lots of things outside for the children!",
          "I usually never write negative reviews but the poor white tiger is all by himself in this horribly tiny enclosure. Free the tiger!! Also, just a boring aquarium overall.",
          "Very small Aquarium, Then they have a beautiful White tiger in an all tile enclosure, alone. It was the saddest thing. I would not have went if I would have known. I hate that I supported this place!",
          "No, this isn't the Monterrey bay aquarium and certainly not San Diego sea world, but it is a nice yet small aquarium that still need visits to support education. All that aside, the lunch we had at their restaurant was great. The chef came out to discuss my wife's food",
          "This place was overly crowded and very hot(temperature). Parking was fairly simple. The line outside moved fast but the exhibits seemed a little out dated. I expected a little more from a big city museum. I\u2019m not going to let my 1st visit dictate future visits,so I will",
          "Very small venue. We went because it was included with the City Pass. I would have been more upset if we had actually spent money on actual tickets. Parking is $8 which is a lot considering we spent about 30 minutes there. 15 minutes of it was looking at the few tanks of fish",
          "The actual aquarium was small I was surprised. Everything after is an extra fee so check their site I got the all day pass for about $22 and down the whole place in 45 minutes. I did the train ride but due to the hurricane they cannot stop under the sharks which is the whole",
          "There are a lot of different activities for all ages. The aquarium has a good selection of species. Enjoyed feeding the sting rays. The Bengal Tiger was gorgeous. After we enjoyed the carousel, ferris wheel and train. Several carnival games. Good for all ages.",
          "Unless you have a house full of screaming kids that need to expend serious energy, there is no reason to come to this venue. The cost far outweighed the size of the place and then there was an charge for parking. If you are an adult, skip this entirely. I don't mind seeing",
          "I generally do not like coming to aquariums as it is sad to see so many animals in such small enclosures. My daughter really wanted to go, so we did. No lines on a Sunday so that was a surprise. Paid parking here. I think this venue might be better for smaller children who",
          "We don\u2019t have this business in Memphis. When you in Houston area you must go to Downtown Aquarium. This was out first place to visit when we landed in Houston.",
          "I brought my 12 year old, his friend and 1.5year old here. We were super excited because so far Houston's museums had been great. Then we got here.... We had to pay to park which at first seemed ok, then we paid $60 to get in and in less than 20 min it was over.... I was really",
          "Really well kept aquarium with a stingray touch tank, rides, beautiful live coral tank and a good restaurant! I would highly recommend this for families and friends as a great way to spend a day and learn about the different animals they have.",
          "The food was good but for the price not by my calculations, not to mention the pay for parking.... in the restaurant you pay for a very expensive meal and drinks. We had one.. I understand its a business but people with a moderate income will go somewhere else.",
          "This attraction was a nice adventure...other than huge fish it had small animals and and rides outside.The highlight was feeding and petting the stingrays,now that was cool...I don't know many people that can say they have done that before!",
          "We decided to stop here during our short trip to Houston. The entry for all events was $21 - most of the Park was closed and the aquarium took 20 mins to walk through. The Ferris wheel was ok as was the shark ride, but would have been better to get out of the train to see the",
          "Went to this \"aquarium\" around spring break in the middle of March 2018 with family. You pay around $14 with tax to tour a less than 15-minute aquarium \"experience,\" but not before paying about $7.50 to park, which is simply just not worth it. First off, you're likely to find",
          "This aquarium was a pretty good one. It had a bit of everything, even though it is smaller. The sting ray part was good for the kids. The train ride was neat. We had the city pass but upgraded for $5 each to get the whole experience. The place seemed clean and well maintained.",
          "I accompanied my daughter on her first grade field trip so it was our first time visiting. My daughter's favorite part was petting and feeding the stingrays. The amusement park outside was decent with a carousel, ferris wheel, train and no gravity drop ride. The concession stand",
          "Sorry to start like that, but it's not worth the money nor the time... if you went to Houston zoo, it's more then enough, if you have a city Pass , go there to pass the time. The exhibits are nice and easy to see but it is a small place and you are done in an hour top. And it",
          "This was less of an aquarium and more of an attraction with fish. The whole indoor part of the aquarium took 30 mins or less It was very basic and the parts that were actually interesting (sting ray, train ride through the shark tank) cost extra. This would be an okay place",
          "It would have been nice to have a separate line for the city pass holders since we have already purchased our tickets. But once we made it through, the aquarium is beautiful, clean and well set up. The displays were bright and clean and easy to view with the number of visitors",
          "We LOVED this aquarium that also has two of the most beautiful white tigers with a wonderful viewing area. This is a place that should not be missed if you have children as there is also a delightful outdoor area for them as well with a ferris wheel and rides.. We did not eat",
          "We went with friends and kids. Too hot (better misting stations would help), too much cost for so few rides, the food was not fantastic. Won\u2019t be back.",
          "Basic buffet with just a few options to choose from... the quality of the food was poor. Brunch was expensive even for the kids. I am not coming back... I will give 2 stars because the kids enjoyed with the fish tanks",
          "We love visiting the Aquarium because there are fun rides, the restaurant full of fish in aquariums, a train ride around the property...under and through a huge aquarium filled with large fish and sharks, and live stingrays to feed and touch. People of all ages can enjoy. Our",
          "Mediocre, over-priced food in this gorgeous aquarium in downtown Houston. Worth the price to see all the fish though. My teens enjoyed the Ferris wheel (sunset is fabulous!) and another spinning ride. Good for spring break stay-cation or when you want a sucking sound from",
          "I can see how this place can be fun for the kids and a nice place to eat dinner. But, I was disappointed with the aquarium itself. With it being an aquarium you would expect to see a wide variety of aquatic animals yet there were many land animals such as snakes and frogs. And",
          "As other reviewers have noted, the aquarium is owned by a seafood restaurant. The experience is underwhelming. Many of the exhibits are too small for the fish and reptiles and, of course animal right activists have rightly pointed out that that housing a tiger in such a small",
          "Great food and beautiful atmosphere. Friendly wait staff. My fish was perfect. Fun rides outside and the white tigers are awesome! Be sure and visit the gift shop! I got some unique wall plaques on my last visit.",

          "I was pleasantly surprised by Houston's aquarium. I was expecting much less, I'll be honest. We bought Houston City Passes, which jncluded tickets to the aquarium and 4 other attractuons. I learned a lot about their animals and hadn't thought about how the aquarium sits next to",
          "Where else can u go eat, play, learn and ride rides. This is the place the entire family will enjoy. The kids will learn A Lot about different types of animals. It's the only place (except the zoo) you can see real beautiful Tigars and touch a sting ray in the same trip. Go and",
          "Sooo much fun. Loved the carnival rides and grounds. A good time. My daughter's daycare visited. We had children between ages 2-5.",
          "We were unfortunately very disappointed in this aquarium. It was so small and the choice of sea life was minimal to none. When I saw the gift shop I tried to tell my family there must be another hall to enter to see more things but there was not. I would not waste your time",
          "I went with my toddler. He just learned to identify fishes so he enjoyed looking at the fishes. It\u2019s not that huge and once you walk through and exit, you cannot re-enter. We must have walked through in about an hour. I only wish we had walked through slower (and we did take our",
          "Not overly impressed. Lots of fish to be seen and their tanks looked healthy and clean. Surprised to see so many animals too and in very small enclosures compared to natural habitat - many seemed depressed. Surprised there were midway style rides which were not worth the",
          "Terrible excuse of an aquarium. Very small crowded rooms, the aquarium is over before you know it. The white tigers are kept in an enclosure way way too small, it should be illegal. One of the tigers was pacing and clawing and jumping on the glass from stress. We need to run",
          "I Liked how organized it was even though we went in peak season at a peak time. As soon as you walk in your already in a line to \"tour\" the aquarium then after two or three exhibits your can move on your own. Must tries would be the Sting Ray reef, the white tiger, and the",
          "Wanted to see the aquarium, unfortunately, after driving around the extra small parking lot, the line for the tickets was over an hour! The restaurant wait time was over an hour. What a racket! Games and rides outside were typical carnival crap, way over priced. Stay away!!",
          "We went to the aquarium because of the City Pass. It is part of the package I wanted with NASA. I knew it wasn't a great big attraction, but we were still pretty surprised by how fast our walk-through went. My teenage sons were very surprised to find a large white tiger at",
          "Watched painfully as the attendant moved slower than a sloth loading people unto the lighthouse dive. Just too slow for the amount of people they need to move through. It is over priced unless you get the City Pass. Unfortunately; no Astro World in Houston any longer so you",
          "For a city the size of Houston, our expectations were high. This aquarium was good for children, and was inexpensive. But don\u2019t go if you\u2019re expecting anything like the one in Dallas or Moody Gardens. You\u2019ll be sorely disappointed. We didn\u2019t visit the restaurant, but reviewed",
          "We went there to see the sharks. The only issue was that the train supposed to bring us there was not working. In the end we've lost the opportunity to see the sharks. My children were quite disappointed.",
          "As residents of Houston, we've taken visiting friends and family to the Aquarium for dinner. They always enjoy it, especially if the weather is nice and we can sit outside on the patio with the skyline as our backdrop. There's plenty to see and do there...and it can get costly",
          "Restaurant is good, although a bit pricey. Unfortunately many of the Staff seem disinterested, we walked in and no one bothered to check out tickets, we asked for information at a photo stall and were ignored by four staff. Could be so much better!",
          "A top notch aquarium that is fun for the whole family. The displays are very good with plenty of species and fish activity to see.",
          "I went Houston alone and got the CityPass, so naturally I stopped to check out the aquarium. It's not terrible, definitely better for kids. As a single adult, I'd say pass unless you're really into aquatic life.",
          "Our 3 year old grandson was in town for the weekend. Our family outing was fun as he experienced live sea creatures. Petting of stingray. Beautiful aquarium tanks! Train ride perfect for his age and a ferris-wheel ride! The little park is well designed with easy access from",
          "We enjoyed our meal and the various attractions but everything was fairly expensive for a family of four. Food portions were large and everyone agreed it was tasty. Plus is they take reservations for the restaurant.",
          "I enjoy aquariums of any size... I guess the one in New Orleans... pre Katrina spoiled me because it is awesome... thus one was okay.",
          "Not a lot to see. First time there and was disappointed. Kids liked it for their first time but won't be back no time soon. Will try the aquarium in Galveston and compare.",
          "This was a fantastic visit and very affordable! Highly recommend it! Even though we didn't have our kids with us, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Aquarium and found the staff to be very knowledgeable and friendly.",
          "Average nothing special really, not as good as Chattanooga aquarium, but ok for a been there done that type",
          "I loved watching the sharks and the white tigers but the small space of this aquarium made it feel as if the tigers didn't really belong there. This aquarium definitely needs an expansion.",
          "Located right in the heart of downtown Houston, it offers a nice opportunity for families with kids to take a tour of this aquarium. Let me warn you that do not expect this to be on par with the SeaWorld in Florida or the Ocean Park in Hong Kong. It is small and self",
          "I was very disturbed to see these beautiful white tigers in such a pitiful enclosure with no sunlight and no greenery. This is animal cruelty and completely unnecessary. I cannot believe this is being allowed to happen. Do not go there!",
          "We are native Houstonians, and while the Downtown Aquarium is a nice thing to have for the indoor rainy days, there just isn't much to do. The rides and activities are geared towards a younger crowd and the exhibits don't change, so once you've seen it once, there isn't any",
          "There\u2019s so many things to do at the Downtown Aquarium. Every time I have my friends and family coming over, I do take them here for a fancy dinner with such relaxing ambiance. Then we we go to the rides and see the withe lion. At summer you have salsa on the plaza every Friday",
          "Please don\u2019t go here. Not only do they have caged tigers that aren\u2019t treated fairly, it\u2019s overpriced and not very exciting.",
          "It was so cool being here but very small. But i so enjoyed myself and the entire place was very nice.",
          "We visit here every year with my kindergarten class and it is always a great time! Pay the extra to do everything because it\u2019s worth it! Petting stingrays and the train through the shark tunnel are usually the favorites!",
          "Great place to hangout with your family and friends, try to go during the morning to skip lines and too much people. I recommend buying the Citypass which allows you to visit multiple points of interests like Kemah, the Zoo and NASA.",
          "Almost comical how small this place is. At the very end there were multiple groups including ourselves asking the gift shop \u201cis that really it?!\u201d Do not recommend it.",
          "This is the smallest aquarium I've ever visited but it was fun! There are 2 tigers there. They don't look happy but I hear they befriended the staff, so maybe they are. The fun part is being able to pet the rays at the end. You can feed them too for a small fee.",
          "We loved seeing the different animals. Feeding stingrays. The train ride to the shark tank was a very pleasant surprise. The whit tigers, I fell in love with them.",
          "It looks really impressive online. My husband and I were on a short trip to Houston visiting friends and family. When we travel we alway try and do a few local activities. Since every activity within the aquarium was priced separately we bought the combo ticket. When we got to",
          "We enjoyed the atmosphere and watching the fish in the huge aquarium. The waiters were friendly also. The food was ok but I have to admit that value for money was not that great. If you are going to charge high prices then you should be more creative with your offerings.",
          "We were a bit underwhelmed by this attraction - it was nothing special. The highlight was the manta ray petting tank - low point - one lonely Bengal tiger on exhibit - a pretty callous treatment of endangered wildlife.",
          "My husband loves aquariums so we thought it would be fun to check this one out. We were pleasantly surprised that a white tiger lives here but was also slightly disappointed that there was not much to see. We spent only 30 minutes there including time to play with the sting",
          "It's a gimmicky tourist trap. It's basically a themed restaurant not unlike Rainforest cafe. You can go to some of the attractions like the aquarium but please don't. Don't fund that crap. One exhibit had a dead floating crawfish on top. And at the end the owners somehow",
          "My wife, 14yo son and I visited here today. It was a decent assortment of fish, etc., but fairly small and took less than 1 hour to slowly go through. At $13 per person for just under an hour, a little expensive. Would not go back as have would put this aquarium at the bottom",
          "You don't expect to see white tigers at an aquarium, but they have 4 here although they are not all on display at the same time. This aquarium is fairly small for a metropolis the size of Houston and dated compared to others in Baltimore, Atlanta Long Beach (CA) and Monterrey. A",
          "The view you get while dining is wonderful. I love aquatic life and to be able to have it surround you while enjoying a delicious meal was close to perfect.",
          "Definitely misrepresented by CityPASS. Had to stand outside in freezing temperatures to gain entry. I had to outright laugh when the cashier tried to upsell me after that. Was fun for two preschoolers, but not on our list of things to do when we visit Houston again.",
          "First the Parking. It is cash only and $8 self or $10 valet, so better know that up front then try to drive around and find an ATM. The City Pass clearly says no need to wait in ticket line. Guess what, you are turned back at the entrance to go wait in ticket line, just so",
          "The Aquarium is listed on the Houston Day pass as a must see attraction. We arrived having put 3 hours aside and were initially disappointed to be told that the Tiger exhibit was closed, the train ride was closed as well.. The aquarium took 25 minutes to see. The whole place",
          "The Aquarium is a fun place for local residents to visit on a lazy Saturday when the kids want something new to do. However, there\u2019s nothing really novel about it for tourists. The Aquarium is robust and the exhibits have interesting information similar to aquariums in other big",
          "I was sad that this was nothing special. The food was not anything I can't get elsewhere for a lot less. I can't think of one reason I'd want to return and actually eat here. The server was great, but the concept needs improvement. Very gimmicky. Nothing about it said",
          "I have seen other aquariums and they are a bit nicer, but this is worth a visit. They have some nice exhibits with great learning opportunities for the kids. They have some white Tigers. Beautiful animals to see. A shark voyage, Sting Ray Reef exhibit and a nice outdoor carnival",
          "The aquarium was nice but it's not really that big and your are done in just a couple of hours. We have traveled to better aquariums",
          "Great way to visit Downtown Houston, Lots to see and do and good food. Can get a little pricey if you do a lot of different things here, but it has a little something for everyone. Love to eat and watch the fish!!",
          "It's a cute little aquarium in the heart of downtown. There are a few rides outside of the aquarium for the kids to ride, these cost extra. There is randomly a tiger on display towards the end of the exhibits. I'm not sure how i feel about this as it is a pretty small enclosure.",
          "Quite the unexpected , fun experience . Kids enjoyed it as well as my teenage son. Plenty of attractions and activities for children of all ages and adults will have a blast too!!",
          "Terrible value, small cramped space, few exhibits, and totally overpriced. Felt sorry for the white tiger, alone in a marble mausoleum, not appropriate quarters for an animal.",

          "While billed as an aquarium my view is the Houston Zoo is a much better experience. The aquariu is a for profit private operation that gives you multiple opportunities to spend money on overpriced souvenirs. Food is good and service is just OK . Not great for large family",

          "I really enjoyed visiting here. It is a smaller aquarium but it is very fun and clean. The exhibits they do have are very nice. Also the stingray reef is really cool, you are able to feed and pet the stingrays. The shark tour on the train \u2026",
          "This is a great place to spend the day with the kids. Lots of fun stuff to see and do. The white tiger is so cool.",
          "Kids love this place. Restaurants are good. Very informative place. Been there several times now.",
          "Great place, beautiful creatures everywhere. So many displays of wildlife. It was very clean and the workers were friendly. The shark cave train was definitely one of the best parts. It was absolutely beautiful and probably my favorite part.",
          "Not a bad place to spend a few hours Downtown. The aquarium itself is a little small, but the pricing matches the experience. I suggest buying the all day pass if you are looking for something to do for 2-3 hours.",
          "Went here for my birthday with my wife. We really enjoyed it. Awesome time here. The stingrays were my favorite and they seem to be very comfortable with humans.",
          "Interesting variety of Marine life.  Don't be surprised if you've been to larger aquariums.  This is an entertainment area not primarily an aquarium.  It is pricey food, but great service and yummy.  Wait out the lines and ride the ferris wheel.  Other carnival type entertainment is available just be prepared to pay a lot for a little.",
          "It was so much fun! It is a little small and very crowded, but their animals look well cared for and their exhibits are very cool. The shark tunnel on the train ride is worth the extra money, it is the 2nd biggest highlight - the first, of \u2026",
          "Loved the aquarium! For the all day pass. Worth the price. Tiger definitely was amazing. Also eat at the restaurant, and it was yummy!",
          "Dined at the Aquarium with our family from out of town. We enjoyed our Dinner. All our meals were freshly prepared and full of flavor. Two of our guests have food allergies which we mentioned to our Server. He immediately called their \u2026",
          "Enjoyed seeing the fish. It was small enough that we didn't get too tired.  They had just added some white Bengal tigers to display.  We just saw a lioness pacing in an enclosure.  The enclosure does have a nice indoor area with a water pool and an outdoor area too.  It was just a little chilly when we went",
          "Definitely a place you must visit, had so much fun.",
          "Short and sweet. Would recommend getting the extra day pass for added value. Great place for kids. It does get loud and busy during peak times. The restaurant is cool with aquariums all around. Although it feels weird eating fish in front of fish...",
          "Great place for kids of all ages. I love the white tiger exhibit. The saw fish is really cool on the train ride.",
          "Went there for my granddaughter's bday. The Hostess, Lupita and another young lady i just cant remember her name, the server., Antonio out at the games, everyone we encountered was so helpful and wonderful and accommodating.  only one child \u2026",
          "The place was amazing, people working there are really friendly, and helpful.\nMain ride/Attractions are:\n 1)White Tigers of the Maharaja-The magnificent white tigers in there.\n2)Stingray reef, where you get to touch and feed Stingrays which \u2026",
          "It's not the greatest place in the world but it's definitely good place to check out once. The shark tunnel train was the highlight for me. The white tiger is also pretty cool.\n\nI did think the tanks for the fish were pretty small.",
          "My 2 year old had an absolute blast!! We loved the train with the shark tunnel! That was neat. Everything was clean, the staff was very polite and helpful. Definitely recommend going! Also, the drive to the aquarium with all of the \u2026",
          "Well maintained..  varieties of fish's are there... kids will like the rides...\nBetter Carry your food or snacks..\nRestaurant and snacks bar available but it is over priced.",
          "The downtown aquarium is a great place for all ages! The rides are fun, the actual aquarium is nice, and the restaurant serves good food though pricey! I Highly recommend.",
          "It's not a standard aquarium that you usually expect when someone says \"Aquarium\". It's considerably small, and the variety of exhibits is also less, compared to say Georgia Aquarium or say Monterey Bay Aquarium. But then, the ticket prices \u2026",
          "Small nice aquarium. Takes about an hour to go through. Even has tigers.  Petting the sting rays was fun.  Outside there is a small carnival area for the family.",
          "A rather small aquarium but nicely done. They had the largest octopus I have ever seen and he was very active. They also have a tiger exhibit, of white tigers.",
          "Great place for an outing with the children! Not a super large aquarium but the restaurant definitely made up for it. We had a great time! \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Was a smaller than I thought it would be from the reviews I read. But the exhibits were good and had more animals than just fish to look at. Petting the stingrays was an experience. There weren't many rides. But the $6.50 upgrade was worth \u2026",
          "Fun and educational. Down sides can be parking and the fact that, much like an amusement park, expect a constant flow out of your wallet. The \"all inclusive ticket\" doesn't include all activities, just the main rides.",
          "Had a great time, good food and a variety of animals to see, loved the tigers.",
          "Great places to visit when you come to Houston. Staff was very help friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable and we came just in time to see the new tiger exhibit. They also have a amusement park, food and games for your family to enjoy.",
          "Wonderful experience.  Mercedes was an excellent server. Food was hot and plentiful. \nWell ne nack!!!!",
          "Exhibit is entirely to small, and it doesn\u2019t make sense why there is a tiger exhibition in a aquarium. Doesn\u2019t offer a reasonable military discount or student only takes $1.00 off the total price. \n\nGreat food, but bad customer service at \u2026",
          "we set aside 2 hours to go here and finished all of it in about 30 minutes... I see more animals in Petsmart than this place and Petsmart lets me in for FREE!\nno really, this was a waste of time, money and effort... will not go back... \nit \u2026",
          "Had a great time with my granddaughter.. place was not too crowded at the moment that will help not coming in contact with others at the moment ..is open to the public but as things develop everyone should check before showing up ..but it's very nice place to visit with your children",
          "Definitely has lots for kids of all ages and energies to enjoy! The aquarium itself is really nice, but its definitely worth getting the pass and enjoying the rides and games outside. Highly recommend for families with kids.",
          "Nice place, but a bit overrated. Parking is not that easy to say the least. And the layout is pretty confusing. My big question is \"what are white tigers doing at an aquarium? \" seriously?!?! I'll never understand that. Could have been a \u2026",
          "Great place to take your kids. We spent the hole day there. Had a blast.",
          "Downtown Aquarium was a great experience.  Great facility indoor and out, family had lots of fun.  My only complaint is all the construction in the area made getting into the aquarium confusing, but other than that I definately recommend checking it out when your in Houston.",
          "I purchased a groupon for the restaurant and attraction. For whatever reason my groupon would not validate while I was there. The manager on duty was very helpful, and tried to walk me through it. We were unable to get the validation and \u2026",
          "Solid attraction. My preschoolers enjoyed the rides and fish. Tiger and octopus attraction a bit sad because of the size of the exhibits.",
          "Unlike Dallas aquarium, This aquarium is very small. Regular entry without rides is about 12 or 13$. Parking costs an additional $8. It\u2019s just one floor with different fish, frogs and snakes. It also have a tiger. I",
          "Plenty to do for couples or families of all ages. Everyone had fun. Beautiful aquariums! Good and service.",
          "Valentine's Dinner was top notch. Excellent menu, lounge singer singing the standards and intimate setting.  Totally surprised. Will be back next Valentine's Day.",
          "Amazing place and wonderful service. Tasty food however a bit pricey for the average american. Totally would recommend to a friend.",
          "Great place for families. We loved the exhibits and the train ride that featured sharks. There\u2019s more rides and even a splash pad that kids will love. We\u2019re going back soon. Highly recommend.",
          "Decent exhibits for a few hours, but somewhat limited for those who want to spend a day.  Not nearly as nice as the aquarium in Valencia, which is a city of roughly half the population.  Houston aquarium could expand for sure!",
          "Really enjoyed spending time here. Great little aquarium in the middle of Houston. Has a bar with a huge aquarium that is mesmerizing. Went at night, and cane back the next day to see more and ride the ferris wheel.",
          "Love going here for date night.  Its kind of expensive but he pays so its all good girl!  I usually get full of appetizers and then we go to the venue next door and for a show (which is usually why we are down there in the first place)",
          "This place is more for kids than adults. I had problems getting on and off the train, once on the train, I had to turn sideways to sit down. It's more for a children than adults. I heard great things about this aquarium. With the cost of admission, I was disappointed with this facility.",
          "Animal cruelty! Maybe good place to spend time with kids, but the tanks are too small. You often see fish and other animals not even bothering to move around probably because they\u2019re stuffed.",
          "We loved our experience here.  The tiger exhibit was pretty amazing....you get real up close and personal with the tigers.",
          "This place is designed to get you through as fast as possible and to extract as much money as possible in the process. It's entertainment and rides, pure and simple. If you'd like to learn something, or be inspired, go to the zoo. I have \u2026",
          "Took the family and we enjoyed the atmosphere the food the service pricing is a little high but well worth it.  Plenty of things to do or just sit down and relax. \n Please keep in mind parking is in the back and you will have to pay.",
          "Food is pretty good but the price is a little high.  I do understand they have to pay for the attractions there so i deal with it because my kids love this place.",
          "Beautiful.  Very reasonable in price.  Great assortment of fresh and saltwater. A surprise with Bengal tigers.  Great fun at the stingray tank! Must see and do for the whole family!",
          "This is definitely one of the better 'date places' to go to in Houston.  Between the midway and aquarium, it's a lot of fun.  Especially during the autumn when it's not too hot.\nFood is good but you're going to pay a pretty penny for it.  Factoring in the whole experience though, it's worth it for sure.",
          "The aquarium was awesome, comparable to many other State Aquariums. I was surprised that they have a White Bengal Tiger which was quite unexpected and amazing. The reason for the 4 star rating is that certain parts of the aquarium were \u2026",
          "Great for little kids. As two adults we walked through the whole place in 30 min. Worth it if you buy the Houston City Pass. The coolest part is feeding the sting rays. For a few bucks you can buy a tray of 4 minnows. Coolest part for us.",
          "Interesting sea animals on display. Enjoyed watching the intelligent octopus as well as the majestic white lion.\n\nRenovation and construction ongoing restricted access it seems.",
          "Enjoyed the train ride and the tunnel with sharks! All the rides were fun. The food was also very good. A little on the pricey side. Loved the white tiger. Plenty of fish all kinds for kids and adults to enjoy.",
          "I had lunch at the Downtown Aquarium with my new team from work.  The food was excellent and the dining room aquarium was great for starting a conversation.  I had the crab cakes... Delicious!  The lava cake for dessert topped off a great meal!!!",
          "I was actually rather disappointed by the aquarium. There weren't very many exhibits to look at. The one in Denver Colorado is a lot better and owned by the same company.  5 minutes and you were already done with the inside. The rides outside and the train were pretty neat but that's about it.",
          "Great time! The tiger attraction and the train ride are the best my 5 year old loved it",
          "Super small. Unless you\u2019re taking your kids to the rides outside all day, it\u2019s pretty silly. Walkthrough of aquarium was like 10 minutes... concessions didn\u2019t wanna make any more hotdogs and closed up randomly for hours? Oh well. Won\u2019t visit ever again.",
          "Very aesthetically pleasing attraction. Relaxing patio particularly in the evening that allows you to watch the palm trees and lights from the rides. The aquarium itself was smaller and less spectacular than I had imagined but I'm still \u2026",
          "Would be a better experienceif the staff actually looked after the animals in their care. Had to go and get a staff member after two little boys were banging and growling on the poor tigers den glass doors for 10 minutes. Apparently their parents could care less.  Feeding and petting stingrays had to be the  best part in my opinion .",
          "Small but well maintained...Kids enjoyed both indoor and outdoor attractions... the best was train ride through the shark tunnel... our kids did around 4 trips...",
          "Very nice staff.  The tiger have not been there when I have gone but they do tell you that they are not available when you go to buy tickets. Clean place with gray attractions.",
          "It was disappointing honestly. I love animals, I plan on working with animals in the future and a lot of the animals here just looked terrible. The reticulated python was grossly overweight with tons of stuck shed all over and showed signs \u2026",
          "Fun and entertaining!! White tigers were a bit random but the overall experience was pleasurable. Lots to see and do.",
          "Sawfish is so cool (take the shark train ride)!  It's a bit more geared for children and families. Some big fish indoors too! Cool view from ferris wheel.",
          "The Downtown Houston Aquarium was a really nice find. I enjoyed walking through the various rooms viewing the tanks of assorted marine life and land animals. They have a small amusement piece that features items like a train as an added \u2026",
          "Enjoyable place to take the kids.  A bit on the expensive side if you go to the restaurant and visit the aquarium exhibits.  You can see lots of the fish and aquarium life if you eat in the restaurant, so I wouldn\u2019t have also bought an \u2026",
          "You can learn about the different animals. There is fun things to do. The atmosphere is good. Its fun for everyone.",
          "ThIs is a good place to visit with the kids! But it can be expensive. Actual Aquarium is small, but there is a train that takes you to a shark tunnel. Rides are fun but they change each. Regular admission + each ride. There are picnic \u2026",
          "Took the kids here for the day, and we all had a blast! My boys loved the train ride!",
          "1st time eating here and loved it. Especially the fish roaming around makes you feel like your with them.",
          "The kiddos and I loved it. Great food, good fun and awesome exhibits.",
          "Seriously, unless you're bringing your 8 year old child here to see the fishies, this place is over priced, corporate food and a total tourist trap. My waiter made me feel extremely awkward. Also have fun paying $10 just to park in the Aquarium parking lot that you're only there to eat in. Total joke.",
          "I had so much fun with my kids\nMy babies enjoyed it so much, specially the train ride. We could not get on nothing else because it was raining. But we had so much fun!!",
          "The place is beautiful and the exhibir\u00e1 very Well thought out. The food at the restaurante is very good, though I would say a bit pricey ($90 for two with one side salad and one dessert). Overall a great place to enjoy a day, especial of you have children!",
          "Need better signs for where the bathrooms are. Other than that everything was pretty cool.",
          "My son loves this place mainly for the stingrays.  The stingray exhibit is the best. The rides and exhibits are neat but pricey.  It ends up being about $70 for me and my two kids to go and sometimes we just want to go for a couple of \u2026",
          "It's not that big aquarium as I thought !  In 15 minutes  you can  finish  your visit... It's good for small kids and the amusement rides are good for kids. Houston City pass not worth Colabrating with downtown aquarium, as you need to pay extra for rides!",
          "The other 30 to 50 employees  at this restaurant are 10 STAR worthy however,  the 2nd floor hostess is beyond rude and condescending. My mother uses a cane to walk and we were told our party would be on the 3rd floor, my mother could not \u2026",
          "Decided to take my daughter out to see the creatures of the sea, we had a great time. The staff was pretty professional and made the experience itself a great adventure. Only thing I'll say is if you wanna catch the train then arrive early. Overall a memorable experience and a great memory to have with family.",
          "In comparison to other city aquariums I have been to in California and Florida, Houston's is average. However, for $15-$20 per person, a family can have about 2-3 hours of fun. Food for the Ray's is not included in the price so be prepared \u2026",
          "My kids love it. Well, I like visiting too, you can easily spend half a day here with all the cool stuff the Aquarium offers.",
          "Great atmosphere,  great food, great service & friendly staff.  Like looking at the huge aquarium of salt water fish. There is more outside the restaurant. They have an interactive display where you can touch the stingrays and more. There is even white tigers. Outside there is a train that go under a huge aquarium of sharks and more.",
          "Went last night with the family and had a great time. Didnt have to wait in lines and all staff was friendly and accommodating. Thanks for a great experience",
          "We really loved it. It's a lovely place to go with the little ones.",
          "Houston Downtown Aquarium is the worst aquarium I have ever been to. First of all for an all day pass  (which includes aquarium entrance, stingray entrance, shark train ride and midway rides) You pay the adult price 20.99 weather your 42 \u2026",
          "The food was good but the noise level was to high. Very difficult to carry on a conversation. The service was good considering they were packed with lots of big groups of people. Definitely a young person's place.",
          "We had a great experience at the Aquarium and its restaurant. The service was great, and the facility was pretty wheelchair accessible. The food was quite good, and giant cylindrical aquarium makes for a lovely view. The actual aquarium isn't as impressive (or scholarly) as some, but the place is great for kids or a fun date.",
          "Let's just call this what it is, a TOURIST TRAP! We visited with our CityPass and the parking fee ($8) alone, would be a rip off for a family of four to see this \"exhibit\". They lack the communication and training for CityPass, no idea how \u2026",
          "Enjoyed my cousins baby shower. Food was very good and the restaurant was clean. We had a party of 20 or more and although we had two servers we were all constantly asking for drinks. Other than that the servers were great and we really enjoyed ourselves!",
          "Place is fun! My 3 yr old granddaughter loved it! The train was a short ride but fun! Would have liked to have seen tge white tiger. His place is under construction ATM.",
          "Amazing place if you love seeing the most craziest fish especially its in the touristic area of downtown",
          "Had a exquisite time with my wife. She loved it and said we will be coming back very soon.",
          "Took my grandson on a Saturday.  The line to board the shark train was a long wait, but we both enjoyed the ride when we finally got on!  Didn't find the white Tiger??",
          "A Lovely place to spend time with your family and watch the fishs too. A learning something about the sea as well. A wonderful place!",
          "Great tank and environment design. Rather small aquarium. The highlight are the tigers (!). Overall do not expect something amazing.",
          "Went for the Valentine's day special and it was so beautiful. The wine and food was amazing.",
          "We had a really good time, we got there early so that we could get parking (very affordable, $8 for all day). We started our adventure by feeding the stingrays, so much fun after my daughter and I freaked out. Then we walked around the \u2026",
          "I took my kids to the aquarium yesterday and we had fun! We had the all day pass and went on the Ferris wheel and train as well. The lines were super short so it was enjoyable. Employees are super nice! Only complaint is exhibit is super short but other than that we had fun.",
          "My son liked it but I thought it was small for the money paid. And they should offer a free day to the community of Houston at least.",
          "It's a cool fun place it just seems like it would be a lot bigger.",
          "Had a ready good time here. The train ride was so fun..",
          "Great aquarium and restaurant. it's a little pricey.  The outdoor activities are good as well.",
          "FANTASTIC. No very costly. And is well worth the cost and is educational",
          "My daughter had an amazing time here. The aquarium itself is small but it has a lot of nice exhibits. The nest part though is to pay a fee extra on the admission price and get unlimited rides. Rides are highlighted by a train ride through a shark tunnel but also include a ferris wheel, the frog hopper, a carousel, and others.",
          "Loved the aquarium, I liked being able to pet stingrays and being close to a white tiger and see lots or different types of fish n saw sharks over my head and all around me and the rides were all so cool",
          "love going there and see all kind of fish and the lions they have kid friendly rides and if you take the train ride they take you to see a shark tunnel",
          "We always take friends and relatives to the popular tourist spots when they visit us in Houston. They really enjoy what city pass has to offer. Highly recommend!",
          "The only reason I'm giving four stars is because it's on the small side. However, there is still a great variety of fish. It's looks well maintained and is very clean. The stingrays are included in the admission cost which is a wonderful experience.",
          "Amazing and fun. Prices are reasonable.\n\nThe best thing they have is the sting Ray tank.",
          "This Aquarium is really small one. Not too many species to see but you can spend some time outside as there are many kid friendly activities. Also there is musical show which if you enjoy then go for it. I would not recommend it but if you haven't been to Aquarium before then you can give it a try. It's pretty average though.",
          "Love this place  me and  my wife went  on our anniversary  service  is great  great wait staff  asome service",
          "Really fun! Had a good variety of animals and sea life. Staff were very friendly, restaurant waiters were very polite and friendly! Shout out to A. J., our waiter! We had a great time.",
          "Absolutely great. We stayed all day. The dining was great also. One if the prettiest restaurants I have ever been in.",
          "It\u2019s quite a nice aquarium - pretty, clean, and some amazing fish. However, it was around $16 to go in, which is more than advertised on their website, and no reason was given for it being more expensive. Also one of the biggest exhibits - \u2026",
          "Food was great, the stingrays were really cool but seems like a lot of money for not much to look at. We think the restaurant had more fish than the actual exhibit. But kids had a good time!",
          "Amazing place to have a birthday dinner. Vast aquariums stretched throughout restaurant and an amazing blue glow give this place a very memorable feel.",
          "The only reason this place has visitors is because it is part of the city pass package... parking is $8, all the fishes are in small tanks, sting ray feeding fishes are $1 EACH. One tiger at the end is by itself sleeping... not sure why they chose to have a tiger at an aquarium.",
          "Nice aquarium, small carnival rides, train that goes to a large shark tank, ray petting bay and did I mention White Tigers? Multiple pay packages to plan your day your way! Can be enjoyed in a few hours or turned into an almost all day affair. Would recommend a visit, no matter the duration.",
          "Pretty smal. Great future is that they also have reptiles and white tigers (although in my opinion, white tigers should have more space and not live in captivity). Within 1.hoir I walked through the Aquarium.",
          "This place was just as fun as I remembered it when i was a kid. Seeing the different species of aquatic (and not aquatic) life is just a fun activity. The rides are fun, too.\nThe only bad thing that happened with my short visit was that for \u2026",
          "THIS NICE PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR JUST GO TO SEE THE AQUARIUM NICE TRAIN RIDE THE BAR ON 2FLR WAS GREAT SIT DOWN RESTAURANT. WE GOT ADULTS TICKETS FOR ALL DAY $22",
          "Great, friendly, professional service. Excellent food. Should give Alief School district a rain check since they missed out on so many fun activities due to the rain that poured during their entire time there.",
          "The entire experience was great. The food and presentation was very good. The service was excellent. Prefect for a date night",
          "Location is very small. I see it being good for just the younger kids. As they don\u2019t realize it\u2019s the same type of fish over and over. All the rides are catered to them. So if you don\u2019t have kids don\u2019t waste your money on the all day pass. \u2026",
          "Awesome lots of enjoyment fishes snake tigers crocodile bears comfortable train and with guided history lot's of fun \nDon't miss if you are in USA Texas",
          "Great place for the kids. It's expensive then again everything is nowadays. Was great feeding and petting the sting Ray's. The food was amazing. Service and staff were really good. Hays off to the employees.",
          "This is a very enjoyable aquarium to go to. The only reason I'm giving four stars is because it's on the small side. However, there is still a great variety of fish. It's looks well maintained and is very clean. The stingrays are included in the admission cost which is a wonderful experience. Definitely will go again.",
          "Great place to take your kids.",
          "h town got nice aquariums.",
          "On the smaller side type aquarium with limited fish display.  Nice set up for those with young ones and the restaurant inside is decent but not cheap.",
          "Very fun, lots to see and explore, and a good overall value.  My son and family thorough enjoyed our visit.",
          "Not super impressed by the food. I get that prices are inflated because they have 15 thousand fishes to take care of but I cant say that the food was special. It tasted very bland. I gave it a additional start because they took my pepper \u2026",
          "It was very crowded but that is to be expected from a tourist attraction. Rides cost extra. And pay for parking. The attractions were very nice i loved the jungle type theme they had going on. All in all it was nice but I have been to larger and nicer Aquariums in other Cities.",
          "Smaller aquarium. Not nearly as extensive or as elaborate as other aquariums (Dallas World Aquarium, Moody Gardens), but enjoyable.    Several amusement park type rides for the younger kids, but luckily tickets for the aquarium itself can be purchased separately. Parking was a bit of an issue.",
          "The fish are gorgeous and worth the trip. The train is so squeaky you can't hear the info given over the speakers. The food and service were awful.",
          "The pasta was good but I preferred a little more sodium in it for a tastier kick. I wish they had a better beer selection. The only problem that I didn't expected was the $8 parking fee. The restaurant would not validated the parking fee \u2026",
          "Parking was very limited. Not much for sharks which was disappointing. Lots of little fish. Some cool eels.",
          "Omg it was so beautiful my daughter and I are from New Orleans and we enjoyed the rides and the Aquarium itself",
          "Was great it is small but enjoyable the restaurant is romantic and you are eating with aquariums full of fish around you.",
          "I liked the train ride and the jellyfish it was a great thing to do with younger children.",
          "I FINALLY WENT HERE & ITZ AIGHT BUT NOT LIKE WAT I EXPECTED IT 2B ITZ KINDA OVA RATED & IK DEY COULD DO BETTER THAN DAT BUT ITZ KOOL I GUESS\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf",
          "The aquarium itself is small, but very compact. As such, there's a large variety of fish for both freshwater and saltwater in a small area, which makes the trip difficult if there's a large amount of people in the aquarium at the time. \u2026",
          "The price was great. Children 2 and under are free. They do a family picture at the entrance; which we bought and love! Once inside, it was spacious to accommodate the high volume of people standing around exhibits. It was our first time, \u2026",
          "It was an amazing place.  My kids are older, so not as much for them to do.",
          "This place is amazing!! Price is not bad at all. Employees are very kind and nice. Just the refreshments station girls need to smile a bit more.",
          "I love visiting the aquarium with my kids, there's so many things to see.",
          "The whole aquarium is filled with exotic sea animals, but also a white Tiger! I spent a total of two hours there and made so many fond memories. This place values education of the Sea life, but also quality. The place is extremely clean. The best part was driving through the shark tank on a train!",
          "Bot what I expected,  but definitely something a family can do together.",
          "Very fine, very clean, employees helped out as much as they could Unfortunately they were not as knowledgeable as they should have been.",
          "Meh..not much to see for the price. Then you gotta pay more for the extras they have that's more fun than the aquarium itself. Overall a drag",
          "Definitely an amazing place to bring the family!!! The facility is very nice and the restaurant is soooo good!!!",
          "This place is so small and not worth $20. We spent more time trying to find parking then we did going through the aquarium. We spent $6 on a train ride for the sharks and went through one tunnel. Not worth it AT ALL.",
          "Honestly it was kind of lame. It took us 15 minutes to get through and for some reason there was a tiger. Although that was probably the best part.",
          "Aquarium is the awsome place to come with family and friends. They do have a rides to enjoy also.",
          "First time going and wish i had come sooner! Had fun, enjoyed the rides! The all-day pass is definitely worth it!",
          "Wonderful experience with mangers that actually care and try and please guest! Food was great, and atmosphere is breathtaking! I highly recommend. We'll be back!",
          "Wife has gluten allergy and the head chef is wonderful and helpful.",
          "Omg this place was everything. I really enjoyed my date here. The view is wonderful and the food was so good.",
          "So we had a good time overall. However, there are areas that really need to be worked on. First of the price is at least 150 for a family of 5 including lunch at the restaurant. So it's expensive in my opinion. If you can find a Groupon, \u2026",
          "I Would recommend as an aquarium in Houston\nIt's a great place, It's not the biggest aquarium and it's rather pricey to the point it feels like a bit too much.The exhibits were very nice and well made, the fish seemed happy \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude09",
          "Great food, great service and attractions. Fun for a little night out during the week.",
          "It was pretty cool, didn't realize there was a height requirement for the shark adventure, so we weren't able to go on that due to my daughter only being 3 years old. But all in all a pretty good time.",
          "It is a fun place to see some fish. There is also a ferris wheel and a miniature train.",
          "They got the fish for looking at. The restaurant das have good food.",
          "Good food and a lot of fun with the family both while dining and enjoying the rides.",
          "Not too bad but the label is misleading. The aquarium part is quite small in contrast to the rest of the building. The other part is a resturuant and kid rides outside.",
          "It\u2019s an okay size aquarium but you have to get the all park pass to enjoy everything.",
          "Food is average. You are paying for atmosphere. Its an attraction.",
          "Inexpensive and great for a date night or a family affair. Be sure to get the all day pass for $21.99 so you can experience all the attractions from the shark train to the white tiger, feeding the sting rays, to the riding the ferris wheel over looking the city you are sure to enjoy yourself.",
          "Nice, fairly small aquarium. Specimens are well displayed. The stingray reef, with \u201ctouch\u201d is a nice feature. The shark voyage (extra and outside) is a nice touch, as is the Ferris wheel. The white tiger display is excellent. The restaurant \u2026",
          "It was amazing great first experience definitely going back !",
          "It can be price but the kids always had a blast with the unlimited rides and the train under the sharks they love it.",
          "This was quite a surprise to find on a recent trip to Texas. Fish are beautiful. Staff friendly and knowlegable. Manage comes around to say \" hello\" and the food is fresh, has great taste and is presented well",
          "Lovely and fun! I wouldn't count to much on the food though. Easy problems to fix if you have the time. But it is a good time! And worth the wait. Do check out the indoor attractions! Be sure to at least enjoy the train, too",
          "This was a fun place to go, they are very welcoming of out of towers!",
          "Much to be desired for an aquarium in this size city... Good way to kill an afternoon with kids, but find coupons before you go!!",
          "Absolutely exciting place. You should visit it, no doubts",
          "Go if you can. It is a little pricy. The attractions are fun and you won't regret it!!!",
          "Found Half-off Saturday\u2019s online. We took six kids with us and had a great time with the all day pass.  The train ride through the shark tank was a personal favorite.",
          "Super clean and great to go if you have kids but be prepared to drop $$$$ if you go , in the long run its cheaper to buy the wrist bands then to do each ride individually . somewhat educational if you want to go see the animals def a plus. \u2026",
          "Love it. Small aquarium but is nice.\nFeeding the little stingray was great.",
          "It\u2019s just a quite small aquarium for an hour tour but nice experience. I see many kids loved the shark view and happy to stay here.",
          "I love the Aquarium.Staff was very help friendly and helpful.I had an excellent experience at Downtown Aquarium.",
          "I went with my 3 and 3 years old, they liked it a lot, rides were fun.We couldn't see the whit tiger it was under construction and the wheel was close too.It's expensive for younger kids but if you have older kids they can go on the rides for unlimited time.But it's a good indoor place to go.",
          "Our troop went here for our December/Christmas event. We started with Breakfast with Santa. This really is you doing an all you can eat buffet style breakfast while Santa bounces around inside the aquarium in the middle of the room with one \u2026",
          "Too expensive to be so small and nothing nothing interesting to look at",
          "The aquarium is a great place for the kids to enjoy their time and learn about aquatic life",
          "Our Family Fun Day on this beautiful Saturday afternoon was a highlight of our year as our grandchildren met each other and everyone had a great time on the rides, in the Aquarium and watching the beautiful white tiger! It's a do-over and we recommend it to others!",
          "There is no much things to do out there , yet it a great place",
          "Had a great time with our 6 year old granddaughter.  This place is perfect for children but teenagers would be bored.",
          "It was amazing. Never been today was the first time and it blew my mind. I almost did everything I could but I got tired so I know that there is going to be a next time. I was happy. It's good to come with a big family cause everything is \u2026",
          "Awesome service!!!! Our waiter, Chad, was incredible!!!!! The food was super delicious!! Very gluten friendly! Our kids really enjoyed the aquarium!",
          "Well maintained aquarium! Kids had a blast. Nice having a few rides for the kids as well to break up the tours.  The train ride through the shark tank was probably our favorite. The stingray area was also very cool, they let you pet and \u2026",
          "Really nice aquarium I have ever seen before. The fish are very big, and the tiger is beautiful!",
          "Really enjoyed the Aquarium here in Houston although we couldn\u2019t go up stairs due to a private event which the lady who answered the phone could have disclosed that information. Overall it was very nice and a nice way for me and my fianc\u00e9 to enjoy a evening out.",
          "I can\u2019t believe that me and my partner paid $30 to be provided with an aquarium which lasted less than 15 minutes to walk around (including reading the information on the fish\u2019s) also you have to pay extra to ride the Ferris wheel etc. \u2026",
          "Very small. No tiger so don\u2019t waste your time or money until they remodel the exhibit. We finished in 10 minutes. We were told to go around and go again but once we went back to start we\u2019re told we needed separate tickets. Go to the zoo they have nice aquariums there.",
          "Amazing experience with multiple aquariums with several species of fish. Unfortunately not labeled, but not going to ding them a star for that. The aquariums were clean, sting ray tank and shark exhibition are cool. Had lunch up stairs. \u2026",
          "Interesting, but not enough \"content\" to be worth the price.",
          "It was great me and boyfriend went here last year and we plan on going again our favorite thing was the Ferris wheel they let us ride as many times as we wanted \ud83d\ude42",
          "It's a nice aquarium. Kind of small. If you stop to look at all exhibits it may take about 45 min. Otherwise you may go through pretty quickly. They do have a white tiger exhibit which is really nice and they are building an outdoor \u2026",
          "Really enjoyed the restaurant! The food and atmosphere are great but the service was even better! Waitstaff was kind and so cheerful! We were served quickly and the food was delicious!",
          "Love looking at the fish. Very small for the amount of money charged for aquarium and stingrays.",
          "Had a great time with my daughter! The food was really good too!",
          "Had the best time! Took our 2 year old grandbaby and she absolutely loved it! Everything is so beautiful, the fish are amazing and the white tiger is unbelievable! Definitely recommend going here if you are looking for something to do!",
          "Small aquarium loaded with enough fun for an exciting family day out. The exhibits looked well maintained with some fascinating species on display. We had cartoon drawings of us made outside which was a fun activity as well. A couple of \u2026",
          "All the fish had tiny tanks and one eel could literally just swim in circles. Then they had the random tigers at the end. Those tigers had no sunlight and their exhibit was bare and small. Although I\u2019m an animal lover I\u2019m not a radical peta or activist but I still believe these animals deserve a better space it was tiny.",
          "Not sure if this is an aquarium or an amusement park. But I believe the idea was to bring both features together.  However, the scale is not sufficient enough. If both the aquarium and amusement park areas were expanded then this could be a great experience!",
          "This Aquarium was awesome, but when it comes to the \ud83e\udd88 sharks, you better be ready, bcuz in a blink of an eye you are passed them. I found this out when my son told me to be ready, \ud83d\ude01. Otherwise I had an excellent time.",
          "It's an aquarium.. but small. I was disappointed. The walk-through is short so take your time and enjoy the tanks. Take pictures, read the descriptions, really absorb as much as you can because it's the white tiger at the end is the last exhibit. And hopefully it's not asleep for you like it was for me.",
          "It's fun because you can see cool interesting s\nstuf.",
          "It's very small the fish are well cared for and healthy but the discus tank is sad. They could be made into a really cool tank but they are in a very small set up and they are very basic for all.of the varieties they come in. A natural \u2026",
          "This was a nice place to chill for a moment with my husband. The exhibits are beautiful and the restaurant was nice. The staff was friendly.",
          "It was so cheap and employees are so friendly.. Keep doing a great job",
          "Pretty cool place, get the all day everything pass",
          "Good place for a day trip and is a decent size the has a great selection of displays!!",
          "The aquarium is a nice place to visit but I expected much more.",
          "very nice, would be perfect of they had a section for dolphins!",
          "Me and my boyfriend enjoyed it. It was something to do...we both got the all day passes. The shark ride was ok could have been a little longer. I didn\u2019t get to ride some of the rides(currently pregnant) the stingrays were pretty awesome. \u2026",
          "I think this place was okay. I didn't understand the point of having the White tigers there at an aquarium. In the middle of downtown in an aquarium. How about replacing those with actual sea life animals. They looked miserable and there \u2026",
          "Had the Red Snapper with Asparagus! It was on point! Had a Great time dancing downstairs.",
          "Nice facility. It has lots of exhibits. The main attraction is the white tiger. It also have carnival rides.",
          "Absolutely Wonderful Day with Roni, Bri and Addison. Happy Birthday Roni",
          "The aquarium itself is not super impressive as far as amount of fish and animals to be seen. However, the extra stuff was really fun and impressive. Definitely get the day pass that lets you do all the rides and see the stingrays, don\u2019t buy \u2026",
          "This aquarium was not as big as it seems.  The train ride thru the shark aquarium was informative.  They would not let me go on the carousel because I was by myself.  I was on vacation. I paid for an all day pass and didn't even get to \u2026",
          "Nice, fairly small aquarium. Specimens are well displayed. The stingray reef, with \u201ctouch\u201d is a nice feature. The shark voyage (extra and outside) is a nice touch, as is the Ferris wheel. The white tiger display is excellent. The restaurant \u2026",
          "This aquarium is very poorly kept. Most of the fish look sick and overly crowded in the tanks. It was pretty sad to see how many had to struggle to do a simple turn in their fish tank. It was very expensive for what it showed and the way the fish were cared for. Do not go! It\u2019s not a good place to go to. Go to the zoo instead.",
          "It's a decent aquarium, though seems small. Layout is a little confusing, not great flow. Just make sure you pick up the map.",
          "It was a quick trip. Just wish there was more to see. Please remember that these locations are mainly catering halls/restaurants so it is not a full blown aquarium. Splash pad is there but please bring some rubber sole shoes as it is \u2026",
          "We had our association Christmas party here. The food was above average but not great. Because it was served as a speaker LUNCHEON, no refills on drinks were offered.",
          "Had an amazing,  awesome good time today at the Aquarium!  We seemed to share every exhibit with several children's care services and we all were wowed!  Getting to pet the different Stingrays was fabulous!  The train ride is a must!!  The \u2026",
          "I was very impressed. Had a great time.",
          "Cost about tr 16 dollars to get in after a long line, the aquarium itself had maybe 15 tanks and anything else u had to pay extra, spent about 50 mins in line for 10 mins of looking at some fish. Not even sharks or octopus or anything neat, just boring fish you could find in ur average pond",
          "This place is nice as a 2-3 hour activity. The displays are really nice, although it seems like the tanks are tiny and there's not much room for the fish to swim. It was very hot outside with no fans around the premissis, so we did the \u2026",
          "Exhibit's  were cool and rides were fun for everyone",
          "Some of the attractions were closed. They only had 1 tiger out. There food at the restaurant was good but the timing to order was long. And they forgot to bring appetizer out.",
          "It wasn't what I expected. I thought it was bigger and much more to see. But if was fun looking at the smart fish. And tiger was amazing and cute.\nThe food was great and really enjoyed watching the fish as I eat",
          "Very nice place , parking needs alot of work",
          "It\u2019s a cool experience if you never been. The Ferris wheel is probably the most important thing to do. Especially at NIGHT, you get a cool view of 45 that you can\u2019t experience anywhere else. Totally tripped me out my first time. \nThe tour \u2026",
          "Best deal is the all day bracelet, unlimited ride and walk Thurs in the aquarium and pet sting Rays. I highly recommended going to the restaurant and you can watch all the fish swim by while you have yummy food!!",
          "A little on the small side, but the exhibits are excellent, very dense and well put together. The shark exhibit is very cool, but I would prefer to walk through at my own pace, rather than be charged an additional fee to be rushed through on a train ride.",
          "Very nice and new, lots of different types of fish and also had a tiger exhibit.",
          "Great place, if it\u2019s not crowded the whole walk can take 30 minutes.",
          "It\u2019s quite a small aquarium but nice experience. The kids loved the shark view",
          "Great Scenic indoor and outdoor dining, train ride is awesome, enjoy a relaxing evening here.",
          "Nice could never find the Marine life lol",
          "This place is really nice for not only kids but adults too",
          "Not really an aquarium, more a kids fun park with a few fish. Children may enjoy it, but it\u2019s definitely not a good place if you\u2019re trying to just see animals and learn about them. Aquarium section is tiny and only takes ~40 min to go \u2026",
          "Nice place. For kids mainly",
          "Wonderful aquarium! Don't miss the shark train.",
          "Not great. The actual aquarium is very small with not much to see. Kids were pretty bored. There are a few rides but some of the workers were rude. One girl was extremely rude and tried to deny my child a ride claiming he was too small, had \u2026",
          "White tiger exhibit is very attractive thing and a lot of things more you will have enough fan there",
          "animals didn't look too happy or well kept. the rides were ok, nothing too great. the people inside the aquarium were nice",
          "This really isn't an aquarium. It's a seafood restaurant.",
          "Over priced with mediocre over priced food. Good tourist destination.",
          "Me and my family had a blast and we were attended properly  by the staff.",
          "If you go for just the aquarium part it's kinda disappointing and very short. They do have a nice white tiger exhibit though.",
          "The aquarium itself has great service a really nice aesthetic quality but if you have a soft spot for animals, I would do research before coming here. My review is solely based on the aquarium as a business but not on the quality of care for the wildlife.",
          "Nice facility. It has lots of exhibits. The main attraction is the white tiger. It also have carnival rides.",
          "I\u2019m from Atlanta, home of the world\u2019s largest aquarium. Keeping this in mind, I was still very impressed with this place. Yes, the aquarium is fairly small but it is extremely clean and well thought out. Pay attention to the small details \u2026",
          "Smaller than expected. Was happy to see that the tiger enclosure is expanding.",
          "It's okay. There isn't much to see. You can basically just eat here and see the same fish you'd see if you purchased a ticket and walked through. I've been to better aquariums than this one.",
          "The negatives:\n- Tiger not there due to refurb.\n- Stingray exhibit not open due to sharks in tank\n- Had to seek out staff to open the train ride.\n- Other rides, etc, not visibly staffed.\n- Aquarium pretty small, meaning with those exhibits \u2026",
          "Great day with kids..nice place and well managed. The only downside is open air rides. With extreme summers in Houston, there must be some shades for people waiting in line or seeing their kids enjoy. Overall, a nice place to visit.",
          "Its convenient and fun even for toddlers. My daughter loved seeing and trying to read the info screens so she wasnt scared of the windows. The tigers were beautiful and the only issue I had was the rowdiness and rudeness because even though \u2026",
          "Great place to visit with the family. Guide provides information on history of establishment and lots of information on sharks.\nThe carnival there is a great place to enjoy with family.",
          "Expensive and small but somehow I always seem to want to take my out of town relatives. The large fish are just unbelievable. Restaurant food is nothing special but then avain something about those live fish you're looking at while waiting for your meal.",
          "Get a 20$ bracelet don't come when it's supposed to be raining have fun",
          "So much fun! Great for children and for the family!",
          "Not worth your time or money. It is more of a fish tank exhibit. I wouldn't call it an aquarium. The tiger was ok, felt a bit sorry for the small space allocated for him.\nThe \"amusement park\" had just a few rides. Not fun for my 8 year old.\nThumbs down \ud83d\udc4e",
          "Took my 3 kids for the first time today, everyone there was very nice and very professional. The shark tour was one of my favorites, the kids enjoyed all the rides. We also ate there and the food was GREAT! our waiter and manager where very attentive. We cannot wait to go back!",
          "Really fun for a nice date, unfortunately we couldn't see the tigers because they are being relocated but nevertheless it was a really fun experience!! Restaurant was not my favorite though, unfortunately :(",
          "Its a decent visit.. kids can have fun",
          "Nice Aquarium. They have a Large variety of Sea life.Great Staff!! I got to feed a STRING RAY. \ud83d\ude01\nThey also have a Few white tigers. But their Shop is a little bit Toooo Pricey",
          "We had a blast! So many interesting fish to see and neat activities to do! Nice little outing...",
          "Beautiful ambiance and delectable cuisine, I enjoyed every moment. Being gluten free,I was impressed with the care and concern of my allergies and the personal touches to maintain my comfort. I enjoyed a wonderful fish with avocado salsa with rice and vegetables cooked just right for my taste.",
          "Great. Clean. Good family fun. Went around a couple of times. Loved the shark tunnel.",
          "Not worth the time or money\nVery few fish to look at, sting ray exihibit was the best part, tiger exhibit coming soon...not sure what tigers have to do with an aquarium? Also there is an amusement park attached to the aquarium, rides are \u2026",
          "Definitely expected more from The Aquarium.  The food was not good.  The Louisiana pasta lacked flavor. The $29 Snapper actually tasted like it was caught in the bayou out back.  We didnt get dinner bread until we asked as if they forgot! \u2026",
          "Went for dinner and got the fish show on the side. We even got to enjoy some outdoor music and rides. It was a great night with the family!!",
          "Feeding the stingrays is the coolest experience. The stringrays are super friendly and want to be fed/rubbed. I saw some fish species I have never seen before here. It is a smaller aquarium but packed with a variety of wildlife.",
          "It was fun. First time there. Awesome Anniversary date from Austin Texas",
          "This Aquarium is cute and full of beautiful exhibits! Great place to take kids, come with family or friends. The prices are affordable and you get your monies worth. This was my first time in Houston and my friends recommended this as a must do. So glad I came! Just beautiful.",
          "There just wasn't much to see to be honest. I did see a sad looking white tiger that paced back and forth inside. Not sure why it's in an aquarium. The staff was friendly and helpful.",
          "Based on the aquarium....not the restaurant.\n\nJust not what I expected. Compared to what we saw online to the actual aquarium, I was disappointed. The kids really enjoyed it though. There are a few rides outside; ferris wheel, gravity drop \u2026",
          "We enjoyed being there and seeing all the displays.  The train ride is fun as always.  Cant wait to go back when the new tiger exhibit is finished.",
          "Went to aquarium downtown houston for grandsons birthday and they spilled 2 trays of food and sauces on my fiance!In her purse,pants,shirt and arms and all over back of chair! They offered nothing to compensate us accept an apology. \u2026",
          "We called ahead yesterday to be sure the aquarium was open despite everything because we wanted our son to see it and they said they would be open today and we show up from 3 hours away and they are closed \ud83d\ude12 wont be comming here we will go to Aggie land zoo instead.",
          "It is a small place in a big city, but it's nice to see several species of the sea. Just great  if you have kids!",
          "From the moment I pulled up to this restaurant I felt chaos.  I had difficulty valet parking, then once we got inside it was so chaotic. Our server (Corey) was horrible. He bought my sisters coffee with no spoon or sugar and then when we \u2026",
          "I loved this aquarium, I got to see all the fishes and amazing tour people",
          "Valet parking went through my personal belonging when they parked my vehicle never going again.",
          "The aquarium was packed-- in more ways than one. The rooms and hallways are narrow, and were overcrowded with people. The fish tanks were also very small and overstocked with fish. They do have some lovely fish, but it's hard to believe \u2026",
          "This is worth a visit, as it is colorful and entertaining.  The food is average, and the prices are what you might expect to cover the cost of the aquarium, exhibits, etc. But, as an eating destination, it is not bad, but there are much \u2026",

          "Loved it.. One star because my 3 year old son slipped and fell in bathroom and got hurt",
          "Great place to explore for a few hours, without finishing exhausted and spent. My husband and I spent a day off here and had a fun time. Parking was easy and pretty reasonable ($8 self, $10 valet). It was only $21 for a full pass for an \u2026",
          "If you can find a parking spot and are lucky enough to visit on a less-crowded day, you will enjoy it! We went on a Saturday that was rainy but had lots of fun. We had to wait a while for rides to open up after the storm, but the ferris \u2026",
          "Nice, fairly small aquarium. Specimens are well displayed. The stingray reef, with \u201ctouch\u201d is a nice feature. The shark voyage (extra and outside) is a nice touch, as is the Ferris wheel. The white tiger display is excellent. The restaurant \u2026",
          "The restourant is a must go, the food is delicious and ouer waitress was very nice, and helpful",
          "Its a cool place just they need to add few more rides...",
          "It was Sooooo Beautiful and the Aquariums were Spectacular and there were even more than there used to be! The White Tiger was in a beautiful setting and seemed to be very content. The restaurant in the second floor was my favorite part with a huge aquarium in the middle. Great Food! Awesome Service!",
          "Great place. I love it !",
          "I know its supposed to be for kids, but I had such a great time feeding stingrays and watching sharks",
          "A great place to admire marine life in all its beauty and throw great parties!",
          "Awesome atmosphere, awesome sounds, amazing sights and great service.",
          "This place is great! They have a good variety of huge tanks and fish. They even have a shark tank that a train goes under. And they have a little amusement park sort of thing going on. The ferris wheel was really enjoyable. I recommend \u2026",
          "Did enjoy it a bit pricey but depending on your interest in fish and a variety of animals native to this region it's pretty cool. Oh and tigers",
          "Great place with awesome thing to see however, a bit small.",
          "This place is neat, and you get to see some cool stuff, but nothing compares to some of the major aquariums like Monterey.",
          "Fun place...love the train ride.",
          "Pretty cool the tiger show was great and the rides were pretty cool",
          "For the price, not a very good value -- small aquarium, and at many of the exhibits the electronic signs were broken so you did not know what was in that particular tank. The shark train ride was fun but again not really worth the price.",
          "Love it. Good food. Great time",
          "Loved this place! My favorite part was petting the sting rays.Can't wait to bring my kids and come with more time!",
          "Not much to see , other then the restaurant which is pretty good.",
          "Lots of cool stuff and friendly staff cool train ride",
          "It was a fun experience to touch the baby manta rays and see the tiger but everything was super expensive. 9.99 for a lollipop inside and 4.50 for the same thing at a concession stand... pretty shady. The train was fun and informative the staff for the rides and games were sweet.",
          "If you've ever been to the Dallas World Aquarium this is a let down for the price. I was honestly expecting more.",
          "Tow for Tuesday! \nBuy one arm and get one free! \nTook 4 kids. Paid. Went outside. All rides closed. \nRefund. I am sorry but not paying $50 to walk around and look at a bunch of other people walking around. \nTillman really needs to come take a look at this place. Not up to his standards.",
          "Great place for Kids and adults. A little pricey, but plenty to see and do to be entertained for half a day.",
          "Such a great time. A little on the pricey side but there are a lot of activities to do with a day pass that include indoor and outdoor things. The exhibits with the tigers and sharks were nice. The rides were super fun but need a little \u2026",
          "First time going to this place, it was nice.\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Fun for everyone regardless of age! We just spent a summer day at the aquarium celebrating my daughters 17th birthday and we had a memorable time!! We rode the train, the carousel and the Ferris wheel. The views of Downtown Houston are \u2026",
          "Because you can explore a lot of stuff.",
          "Nice aquarium lot's of variety of fish. Restaurant is expensive two burgers with fries and drinks cost 50.00. They are good but why two high in price.  I'll be glad when they get the 3rd floor open again",
          "It is a great place visit if you are ever in Houston!",
          "Try the seafood variety and you won't be sorry",
          "Even though it was small, the marine water systems were exciting to view because of the vivid sea life which enclosed all small and tall visitors. Same with the outside amusement rides. We always enjoy a play date with family and friends at \u2026",
          "We stopped by just for the train ride and the kids loved it.",
          "Lots of diverse species, great scenery, great food, and good entertainment!",
          "It was not worth $20+. This aquarium is the smallest I\u2019ve ever been to. It was over in less than 20 min. The only good thing here is the ferris wheel, which we only got to ride once even though there was literally no one else trying to ride!",
          "Took my daughter here for the first time, we ate upstairs despite the 30 minute wait which felt like it went by super quick & the food was delicious. Our waiter was amazing! We will definitely be back!",
          "Overall the exhibit was nice. It was very small compared to other aquariums I\u2019ve visited. However there are many things to do outside that makes up for it. I enjoyed the sting ray exhibit, the shark tunnel, and the Ferris wheel.",
          "Had a great time but there needs to be more signs to point you in the right direction.",
          "It's the perfect take a date place !",

          "Awesome place to visit especially with a little one.",
          "Nice place to spend the day with my grandsons. They love it.",
          "Great for family and friends of all ages.  We celebrated my husband's 61st. Birthday and had a great time",
          "The aquarium is small but delightful. I see how hard they work to keep it neat and fresh. I love the hard work they put into the gardens and parking area. Like how they incorporated Hurricane Harvey facts into the Shark presentation.\nPS the restaurant is great",
          "I herd a lot of rave about this place from the Houston locals it was nice but I must say I have definitely been to nicer aquariums",
          "The staff was very pleasant and attentive!\nVery beautiful atmosphere",
          "We went there on weekday.  Not a busy day so kids got fair chance to enjoy all rides multiple times.  We had city. This is pretty small aquarium and this is best about it as you don't need lot of time to spend there or don't have to walk too much.  Need more places like this in Houston.",
          "Small aquarium, there was a random white Bengal tiger exhibit.  It was cool but really random.  The best part was the touch tank.  You can buy little trays of sardines to feed the stingrays and those little guys are super friendly!! \u2026",
          "Beautiful place with nice atmosphere and many things for kids to do, even rides!",
          "I have allergies and the manager approached my table to explain the dishes I was interested in. Everyone was nice and the food amazing",
          "It didn't  Have enough fish. Very small.",
          "Nice aquarium, but frankly I expected more.  Fun for kids and the displays are very nice.  But there is not that much.  Other aquariums like Monterey Bay, and Chattanooga are worlds better.  It felt like we had just gotten started when I \u2026",
          "It's a fun event for kids and adults",
          "More of a kid friendly place. The aquarium itself is very small and expensive for what is there. Not worth the trip across town.",
          "A great place to take your friends and family when your in Houston the rides were great and the fish were beautiful the stingrays were awesome too the cafeteria was nice too the fountain was cool as well will recommend!",
          "Interesting place. If your bringing kids i would definitely go with the all day pass for aroumd 20 dollars since it includes the rides for kids and the petting of the stingrays, if not the basic entry is 12.99 then you pay for each \u2026",
          "So many things to do we could stay all day here my niece loved all the rides and the aquarium is so peaceful and the tiger too is so cool. The restaurant is also very delicious overall a nice experience the all day pass is so worth it! You can even feed the stingrays!",
          "I had an excellent experience at Downtown Aquarium. The food was excellent, my server was so attentive and made great recommendations for dishes. The ceviche was great as was the rest of our food. We had 2 small children with us and they \u2026",
          "You could walk through the entire aquarium in 10 minutes. It was a huge let down.",
          "The Grandsons had a great time.",
          "I think this place is a good time if you have kids but it\u2019s way to small and when it gets crowded it\u2019s hard to even enjoy yourself the aquarium is small and the tiger looked miserable it took us forever to get through the aquarium due to the crowd and people not wanting to move I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place",
          "Ride staff was awesome! Truly enjoyed the day despite the rain shutdowns. Children loved all of the displays.  Staff inside were personable!  Tiger was beautiful but sleeping.",
          "Was not a fan of this aquarium. Too expensive for a 20 minute walk through. Very few exhibits. I have been to many aquariums and this is one I do not recommend.",
          "Nice little stop in downtown Houston.  Not a big aquarium by any means so don't expect a lot, but what they do have is pretty cool.  At the end of the aquarium they have a white tiger exhibit.  There is also a stingray touching pool and you \u2026",
          "Nice place , good diversity of fishes and a tiger lol,  in one hour you're out",
          "Awesome aquarium! My daughter loved the sting ray exhibit the best!",
          "Love the food and watch the dishes swim in the aquarium",
          "Rides were fun for my two year old daughter and she loved seeing all the fish!",
          "Need not charge parents chaperones.  Also start trip effects little earlier due to break for lunch.  That way children can enjoy all activities",
          "Really great set up for all ages!",
          "Had a great time! Feeding the stingrays is the best!!",
          "The aquarium is very small, but has a great collection.  The staff is nice and it's a great place to be on a hot day.  The rides are great and the shark train is a lot of fun.",
          "The aquarium you can watch while you eat.  That part was great.  I thought the food was kind of overpriced for the quality.  It was neat to go once, but I will not be going back",
          "My Baby girl loved it, excellent  customer service",
          "Not a fish lover but I really enjoyed my visit.",
          "My kids love it and the food is good. One of the few good restaurants with a view here in Houston",
          "My kids loved it! We went on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon. It wasn't busy at all,  the rides had no wait times and staff are friendly. The animals were plentiful, exotic and interesting in the aquarium and on the train ride.  The food at \u2026",
          "Great night out with my lovely lady!",
          "Great place to visit! You can choose the package that matches your family's desire for fun, time and budget. You can visit without visiting the restaurant.",
          "I feel the spaces designated for some of the fish didn't appear to be spacious enough for their size. Some other didn't seem to be in the best shape, so it gets a little sad. They do seem clean and maintained.",
          "Your tour guide said the tigers were monitored as they got used to the outside enclosure. At what point does any animal need to become 'used' to natural sunlight? Makes you quite the monster patron doesn't it?",
          "Looks clean but it's small aquarium with expansive ticket.",
          "You can feed Sting Rays here which was pretty awesome!",
          "The fish & animals are Amazing as well as the atmosphere.",
          "It was lovely. Late afternoon/night time is the best time to go. The aquarium restaurant was lovely.",
          "My family had a great time. Our group of 9 ages 7 to 72yrs. The aquarium itself is very small but full of interest. We attended the Mother's Day Brunch....IT WAS BEAUTIFUL! Food was excellent, great selection and wonderful presentation. \u2026",
          "It was great and prices were great for the group admission.   The wait staff was very efficient.  The manager's personal greeting added a special element.  It was an enjoyable day for my children and their parents.  Thank you for the special efforts.",
          "Great for the kids. Plenty of activities, games, food.",
          "The manager Steven was awesome! However I am rating it 1 star because for a Landrys restaurant it was sub par at best. If you are thinking of doing the breakfast with santa next year.. DONT!!! Big disappointment. Everything on the buffet \u2026",
          "Nice aquarium. Great for taking small children and families. It's usually very crowded but there's a lot to see. I paid $12 and got to see the aquarium and touch the sting rays. There's a nice little gift shop at the end of you want to \u2026",
          "Not much substance under the marketing. The Ray pool was cool",
          "My 11 and 12 year old boys were impressed and had a good time. The exhibits were interesting and enjoyable. They have animal shows that were very entertaining as well as a fun train ride. The other rides were a bit of a let down but would \u2026",
          "I didn't go through the aquarium but I did go I to the restaurant and bar. Beautiful ambiance and super staff!",
          "Love this place so much. I will be going here ago again!!!!!! :)))",
          "Some of the tanks and habitats are far too small but that being said, the animals are looked after and healthy. There should be a pushchair policy because trying to get past people is a pain and practically requires you to climb past. No \u2026",
          "Very well organized aquarium...I really enjoyed being there.",
          "We spent the day walking the aquarium & then played boardwalk games and rides all fun. We ate there too. The food was great but our waiter was amazing! We were the table of 4 with two small kids and he looked like he had some large tops. He \u2026",
          "Its was pretty cool way. General admission is too expensive for what they have though.",
          "Not really that big but I enjoyed it anyways. There are some beautiful animals.",
          "Nice spot.. looks amazing,  just wished there was more to see.",
          "My kids loved it! I didn\u2019t think my 2 1/2 year old would enjoy it as much but he did. We got the super savings bracelet and definitely is worth it to do everything. It was very clean not cold at all and would probably would be better in the summer for they can play with the splashing water they have outside",
          "Awesome place to be anyday, anytime. Twas fun all the way...\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Great Aquarium! A variety of incredible, beautiful, and sometimes scary fish! A huge python, adorable stingrays, and much more.",
          "Nice place to visit and take the kids to.",
          "The food was amazing, the service was great and I loved the atmosphere.  Highly recommend this restaurant.",
          "Everything is quite good, except the pool where you touch and feed the stingrays (apparently with stings removed). They had a good sized tank with nothing but those rays - nothing but rays, lots and lots of rays. No decor, nothing but rays. I fed one and it was eerie fun. But not a speck of decor. I'd give it five stars otherwise.",
          "I went in expecting to see a lot more than I actually did. \nThis aquarium is most definitely geared towards families with kids. Adults planning to go here should expect to see a lot of children, and less exhibits that you would expect. My \u2026",
          "awesome place to take your family!",
          "Needs EXPANDING and more attractions to really get your money's worth! Too expensive to literally be in there for 20-25 minutes, 15 when the tigers aren't there.",
          "Its okay for 20 bucks you can have a nice lil time with your spouse or children. I wouldnt go again but it was okay",
          "Wonderful experience, would have been top notch if the tiger show was available.",
          "Loved it. Very nice friendly staff and very clean. Very first time ever to an aquarium for me  my husband and kids. Loved seeing all the sea animals. Only part the white tiger was asleep \ud83d\ude25 and since we were only in houston for the day and \u2026",
          "Very cool place to take kids!",
          "Nice place to visit- fun rides and games, smaller scale than Kemah, tiger and aquarium are awesome!",
          "I had a wonderful time here... New to H TOWN. The restaurant was also great.. Customer service was really super with it being busy.. We ate on the balcony of the bar.  Food was very reasonable. We took my granddaughter and had wonderful \u2026",
          "Very disappointed. Not worth the money. I took 4 kids with me to this aqurium between the ages of 5-15. We saw the entire aqurium in less than 30 minutes. I paid more than $60. I've been to different aquariums and this was the smallest and most expensive. Save your money, not worth it.",
          "Very small, not much to look at. It took longer to park and pay for tickets than it did to go through the aquarium.",
          "I would have given a five star rating but it would have been nice to have a place nurse my baby girl. I had to go to the restroom where there was already a lady standing & nursing her baby in the corner. At least a sitting area in the rr would help.",
          "Way too overcrowded, 0 organization or crowd control, overpriced just to go through a tunnel infested with little kids with 0 manners. Didn't have time to read any of the exhibits information or even look at it for long the way everyone \u2026",
          "Very basic aquarium. Takes about 30 minutes to walk through. The price reflects this though and is reasonable. They have white tigers as well. Although I did not experience it, they have a small section for amusement park rides, but is a bit on the pricey side.",
          "I love the aquarium just to spend a fun day with my kids and its way better to get the all day pass because you get to go on everything as many times as you want and its kinda cheaper the only thing i didn't like was that there was a little \u2026",
          "Wonderful place for families where the kids can learn and have fun all in one! The weekend specials are great too!",
          "Great White tiger was really marvellous",
          "Loved it..so much to see and do!!",
          "Excellent service. Went here for my son's graduation and top notch food and service. Keep up the good work. Love the fish tank. Keeps the kids busy while waiting for the food to arrive.",
          "Beautiful place, small, but very interesting for every member of the family! All the animals seem to be in very a good condition (still captives, but in a good shape), so, congrats on that",
          "This was my first time here, we went on mother's day because it was close to the theater where my wife had tickets to see a show right after dinner.\n\nThe service and food were both very good. Several people in my party commented on what a \u2026",
          "Liked the shark ride and the sting ray exhibit. Would have preferred static displays of the aquarium exhibit information, the electronic boards rotated the information about the animals either too quickly to read or way too slowly to see the information about the different species in the exhibit.",
          "Nice Aquarium, White Tigers are there as well.",
          "Smaller than expected. Ok prices. Weather was really bad so we only did the regular aquarium. Kind of bummed the only way to see sharks is on the train ride, but as stated it was raining (heavily). Fun and interesting.",
          "Smallest aquarium ever, at a price of a good one, plus $8 to park for the 1 HOUR it took us to walk through. Was expecting much better for Houston. My state aquarium back home is better.",
          "Nice aquarium but the prices or high for the amount of attractions",
          "I went here it very fun and nice I enjoyed it",
          "It was great we loved everything",
          "Fun little place. It's not extremely big and the rides are geared more for younger kids but it's a nice place to visit. There are bathrooms,  a little splash pad for kids, rides, and of course the aquarium.  Our favorite is the shark voyage ride where you get to ride through a tunnel of sharks!!",
          "Well set out aquarium with good displays, however, a bit overpriced for what you see.",
          "First  time I went it was raining,  but entertained ourselces with the animals they had. LOVED  the white Bengal tigers exhibit, beautiful.  I loved the Aquarium restuarant upstairs,; tranquil setting for sure",
          "The fact that they have a tiger in this place just kills me. I did not attribute my money to seeing this poor animal, but just knowing that it's their hurts my heart. All of the other activities they have are great, they just have to let that tiger go",
          "It is always an entertaining place to visit.  Since we live at Houston this is our fifth visit and we always enjoy it. Besides you can get away from the hot weather while you are inside.",
          "Fun aquarium. Lots of great exhibits. Parking is tough to find.",
          "Ok definitely not the best aquarium I've been to.  And there tiger wasn't out for display...",
          "This was are last stop of our vacation.l, and boy was it worth it!  Line was a little long but as expected as we went later in the day. Lots of fish to see and the out side area was nice. GET on the train ride!!! You have to do the train \u2026",
          "This was my first time ever going to the Aquarium and I have lived here all my life. First off it\u2019s a very nice and fun place to go. Bring the family, bring friends or just the kids. They all will love it. Oh and the food is so good. \u2026",
          "Nice, but fairly limited in terms of what it has.",
          "Very systematic display of marine life in display. Experience of touching string ray is very good.  The aquarium can be visited and enjoyed by both children and adults. Overall enjoyable experience.",
          "The restaurant part is why it loses a star. The food is not worth what it cost. You are paying for the experience. The park part of it is very cool though. The farris wheel and train is fun, as well as the other rides. The staff is friendly and the park is clean. My reccomnendation is eat elsewhere and then go to the Aquarium park.",
          "The various arrangement of sea life was wonderful.  There were too many people in one small place. It was difficult  to really enjoy the animals as we were pushed alongside and down  the way by the waves of people. Both parents  and \u2026"

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Gerald D. Hines Waterwall Park, formerly the Williams Waterwall and the Transco Waterwall, is a multi-story sculptural fountain that sits opposite the south face of Williams Tower in the Uptown District of Houston. The fountain and its surrounding park were built as an architectural amenity to the adjacent tower. Both the fountain and tower were designed by John Burgee Architects with Philip Johnson. Originally privately owned in common with the office tower, the waterwall and the surrounding land were purchased by the Uptown Houston Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone, a non-profit local government corporation, in 2008 to ensure the long term preservation of the waterwall and park. The fountain currently operates between 10 am and 9 pm.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nJohn Burgee Architects and Philip Johnson, in coordination with developer Gerald D. Hines began working on the Transco Tower complex in 1982, and completed construction of the office tower 18 months later in 1983. The Waterwall was fully and regularly operational in 1985.Construction and maintenance cost figures were never released, but at the time of completion, Johnson and Hines made public vital statistics about the wall, including measurements and water volume.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe architects' design for the Waterwall was to be a \"horseshoe of rushing water\" opposite the Transco (now Williams) Tower. The semi-circular fountain is 64 feet (20 m) tall, to symbolize the 64 stories of the tower, and sits among 118 Texas live oak trees. The concave portion of the circle, which faces north toward the tower, is fronted by a \"proscenium arch\" shorter than the fountain itself. The convex portion, its backside, faces south onto Hidalgo Street.Water cascades in vast channeled sheets from the narrower top rim of the circle to the wider base below, both on the concave side and on the convex side. This creates a visually striking urban waterfall that can be viewed from various buildings around the district.\n46,500 square feet (4,320 m2) of water cover the interior, while 35,000 square feet (3,300 m2) cover the exterior. The main building material of the fountain is St. Joe brick. However, the Romanesque arches are made of Indiana Buss limestone, while the wall's base is black granite. The entire fountain's water supply, consisting of 78,500 gallons is recycled by an internal mechanism every three hours and two minutes.\n\n\n== Waterwall lore ==\n\nKnown simply as \"The Waterwall\" to locals, the fountain is a popular backdrop for tourists and locals alike. The Waterwall is considered a central part of the Houston landscape and is often host to picnics and concerts.On the night of September 23, 1987, former Oiler quarterback Dan Pastorini married Dena Kindred at a private ceremony at the wall.The wall was an \"official sight\" during the 1992 Republican National Convention.In 2001, the made-for-TV movie The Way She Moves was filmed in Houston and contained scenes shot in front of the Waterwall.The Bollywood song \"Dilbar Dilbar\" from the film Sirf Tum was shot here.In 2013, the made-for-TV movie The Preacher's Mistress was filmed in Houston and contained a scene shot in front of the Waterwall.The 1992 Chuck Norris film Sidekicks had a portion filmed at the Waterwall.In 2012, an original site-specific performance, \"Natural Acts in Artificial Water\" by director/choreographer Stephan Koplowitz was performed on May 19, 20, 2012.https://www.skoplowitz.com/naturalacts\n\n\n== Renaming ==\nOriginally the \"Transco Waterwall\", the waterwall was renamed the \"Williams Waterfall\" to correspond with the renaming of the adjacent office tower due to the merger of Transco Energy Co. with the Williams Companies. The City of Houston renamed the site again on December 17, 2009 honoring Gerald D. Hines for his impact on Houston architecture during the last six decades.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nHines Properties \u2013 Williams Tower",

      "name": "Hermann Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Hermann Park is a 445-acre (180-hectare) urban park in Houston, Texas, situated at the southern end of the Museum District. The park is located immediately north of the Texas Medical Center and Brays Bayou, east of Rice University, and slightly west of the Third Ward. Hermann Park is home to numerous cultural institutions including the Houston Zoo, Miller Outdoor Theatre, the Houston Museum of Natural Science, and the Hermann Park Golf Course, which became one of the first desegregated public golf courses in the United States in 1954. The park also features the Mary Gibbs and Jesse H. Jones Reflection Pool, numerous gardens, picnic areas, and McGovern Lake, an 8-acre (32,000 m2) recreational lake.One of Houston's oldest public parks, Hermann Park was first envisioned as part of a comprehensive urban planning effort by the city of Houston in the early 1910s. Following the recommendation of a 1913 report which identified the then-rural area between Main Street and Brays Bayou as ideal for a large urban park, real estate investor and entrepreneur George H. Hermann, who owned most of the area and served on the city's parks board, bequeathed his estate to Houston for use as a public green space in 1914. By 1916, famed landscape architect George Kessler had completed a master plan for the park which was gradually implemented throughout the following decades. Ultimately, Hermann Park and Rice University are two clear expressions of the City Beautiful movement in Houston.The opening of the Houston Zoo in 1922 and the requisition of a large southern portion of the park for the establishment of the Texas Medical Center in 1943 fundamentally altered the scope and configuration of the space, though significant elements of the Kessler plan\u2014such as the north-south axis extending from Montrose Boulevard\u2014remain and have been expanded upon. Hermann Park experienced a period of neglect in the latter half of the 20th century due to a lack of funding and maintenance, spurring the formation of the nonprofit Hermann Park Conservancy in 1992. The Conservancy has since leveraged over $120 million of public and private funds to renovate and remake broad areas of the park. Today, Hermann Park welcomes over six million visitors annually; the Houston Zoo was the second most visited paid-admission zoo in the United States in 2016 (behind San Diego Zoo), with over 2.5 million visitors.Hermann Park is served by the Hermann Park / Rice University station on the METRORail Red Line, which runs along Fannin Street at the western edge of the park.\nThe Third Ward Redevelopment Council defines Hermann Park as being part of the Third Ward. T. R. Witcher of the Houston Press wrote in 1995 that the park and nearby areas are \"not the first places that come to mind when you say \"Third Ward,\"[...]\".\n\n\n== History ==\n1899 \u2013 Mayor Sam Brashear selected and purchased a site that would later on become the city\u2019s first park in June 1899.  The size of the land was 20.43 acres (8.27 ha) for $26,000. Prior to the purchase of the park, he formed the first park committee who oversaw the purchase and would later become Sam Houston Park.\n1907 \u2013 The Houston Civic Club placed the Brownie statue donated to the City of Houston in Sam Houston Park.  Brownie was created by artist Louis Amateis in 1905, and was first used as a children's water fountain. Over the years it has been stolen and recovered several times before finally residing in front of Miller Outdoor Theatre.\n1914 \u2013 George E. Kessler designed the entrance of Hermann Park.\n1924 \u2013 Hermann Park grew to 133.5 acres (54.0 ha) with the addition of the Golf Course in 1922, which completed construction in 1924.  Its main feature that it had grass greens as opposed to the more commonly used sand in other cities and was well received by golfers.\n1936 \u2013 for the City\u2019s 100th anniversary, the Daughters of Republic of Texas had a log cabin constructed in Hermann Park as a memorial to pioneer men and women.\n1957 \u2013 Southern Pacific steam engine #982 was dedicated at Hermann Park and the Mini-train service was established. The engine was saved after a newspaper letter from Peter Whitney got 75 replies and Southern Pacific donated the engine to the Junior Chamber of Commerce and the city. It took 5 days to move it from Blodgett to the Park, as rails were laid in the streets in front of it. The locomotive was relocated by 50 wheel trailer to Minute Maid Park in 2005.\n\n\n== The Hermann Park Conservancy ==\nHermann Park was presented to the City of Houston by George Hermann in 1914, and is now Houston's most historically significant public green space. Over the years, the Houston Zoo, Miller Outdoor Theatre, the Houston Museum of Natural Science, and one of the first desegregated public golf courses in the United States all have added to the Park's importance as a recreational destination.\nBy the late 1980s however, due to insufficient public resources and very high public attendance, the park became rundown and entered a state of disrepair. In response, a group of committed and visionary Houstonians formed the nonprofit organization known as the Friends of Hermann Park (FHP) to encourage the development of more attractive, usable green space in Hermann Park and to promote the restoration of the Park to its originally intended standards of beauty.\n\n\n=== Creating the Conservancy, Transforming the Park ===\nIn 1993, FHP commissioned a master plan for Hermann Park from Hanna/Olin Partnership of Philadelphia. This Master Plan, created in consultation with the City of Houston and various stakeholders, was adopted in 1997 by Houston City Council. In 1995, Friends of Hermann Park adopted a master plan for Hermann Park that has provided a \u201cblueprint\u201d for all subsequent renovations and enhancements to the Park. In 2004, Friends of Hermann Park changed its name to the Hermann Park Conservancy (HPC) to reflect an institutional and permanent commitment to stewardship of Hermann Park\u2019s natural resources and physical infrastructure.\nIn an international competition, the Rice Design Alliance invited designers to set the tone and revitalize the main entry and reflecting pool that formed a key axis for Hermann Park, \u201cThe Heart of the Park\u201d, and to create a contemporary update to the park's earliest plans by George Kessler and a subsequent, more formal Hare & Hare plan in 1936.\nSWA Group, an international landscape and urban design firm working in conjunction with W.O. Neuhaus Architects and other consultants, was selected over 100 respondents. The most striking of the changes to the 18-acre (7.3 ha) project area was a narrower, more inviting 80-foot-wide (24 m) by 740-foot-long (230 m) reflection pool. It establishes the formal central axis for the space and its slight narrower design afforded elegant pedestrian promenades as well as a double-row of mature Live Oak trees \u2013 one row that had been planted in the 1920s to honor veterans of WW I, and a second row that was added as part of the project.\nNoted in a winning entry for the 2005 National Award of Excellence from the American Society of Landscape Architects, the \u201cHeart of the Park\u201d reflecting pool utilized a biofiltration system of gravel beds and perforated pipes to trap organics so that they naturally decompose. Porous paving systems and decomposed granite also limit potential damage from increased water run-off from the site.\n\n\n=== Ongoing projects ===\n\nThe Hermann Park Conservancy continues working in partnership with the City of Houston to secure funds and manage the design of projects to be undertaken in the Park:\n\nMary Gibbs and Jesse H. Jones Reflection Pool\nMolly Ann Smith and Sara H. and John H. Lindsey Plazas\nEnlargement, renovation and beautification of McGovern Lake (including three new islands as well as bird and wetland habitat area.)\nThe West Entrance facility and plaza for the Houston Zoo.\nBeautification and re-alignment of North MacGregor Street to improve access and circulation in and around the Park and the Texas Medical Center.\nAcquisition of additional land and capital improvements to Bayou Parkland, an 80-acre (32 ha) area in Hermann Park along Brays Bayou being \"reclaimed\" for healthier activities and used extensively for stewardship programs.\nCreation and implementation of extensive stewardship programs, including Field Studies 101, Natural Guard, and Scouting Around Hermann Park.\nCompletion of the expansion and renovation of Miller Outdoor Theatre.\nCoordination of the comprehensive renovation of the Hermann Park Golf Course (completed by BSL Golf Corporation).\nCoordination of the Hermann Park Miniature Train track expansion.\nPlanting of over 2,400 new trees.\nThe park-wide installation of new park furnishings such as light fixtures, benches and trash cans.The Conservancy also developed a Maintenance and Operations Master Plan Study for Hermann Park - the first such comprehensive study ever for this flagship park of Houston. The study identified many concerns for preserving and protecting Hermann Park, including a gap of 20,000 maintenance hours for the Park. In response, the Conservancy hired a Manager of Volunteer Programs. In 2004 over 1,200 volunteers provided over 14,000 hours of volunteer service in the park.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\nArbor in the Pines\nBayou Parkland\nBloch Plaza Cancer Survivor's Plaza\nBrays Bayou\nBuddy Carruth Playground for All Children\nChinese Pagoda\nHermann Park Golf Course\nHermann Park Jogging Trail\nHermann Park Pedal Boats\nHermann Park Railroad (2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge train ride)\nHouston Garden CenterFragrance Garden\nHouston Museum of Natural Science\nCockrell Butterfly Center\nHouston Zoo\nJapanese Garden\nJudson Robinson, Jr. Community Center\nLake Overlook\nMary Gibbs and Jesse H.

      "name": "Buffalo Bayou Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Buffalo Bayou is a slow-moving river which flows through Houston in Harris County, Texas. Formed 18,000 years ago, it has its source in the prairie surrounding Katy, Fort Bend County, and flows approximately 53 miles (85 km) east through the Houston Ship Channel into Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition to drainage water impounded and released by the Addicks and Barker reservoirs, the bayou is fed by natural springs, surface runoff, and several significant tributary bayous, including White Oak Bayou, Greens Bayou, and Brays Bayou. Additionally, Buffalo Bayou is considered a tidal river downstream of a point 440 yards (400 m) west of the Shepherd Drive bridge in west-central Houston.As the principal river of Greater Houston, the Buffalo Bayou watershed is heavily urbanized. Its 102-square-mile (260 km2) direct drainage area contains a population of over 440,000. Including tributaries, the bayou has a watershed area of approximately 500 square miles (1,300 km2).\n\n\n== Route ==\n\nThe upper watershed of Buffalo Bayou is impounded by the Addicks and Barker reservoirs, which comprise a major flood control system for the region. The reservoir system plays a crucial role in delaying and attenuating the peak outflow of the river during large rainfall events. Moving eastward, the Buffalo flows under State Highway 6 and into Terry Hershey Park, a linear park which follows the bayou for approximately 6 miles (9.7 km), culminating at Beltway 8.\nThe bayou meanders around the Memorial Villages between Beltway 8 and Loop 610. The banks along this reach are mostly private property, however there is a public access point and official Texas Parks and Wildlife paddling trail canoe launch at Briarbend Park, which is located in a quiet neighborhood south of San Felipe and west of Voss Road. There is another official canoe launch and access point just outside of 610 on Woodway. Additionally, it is legal to access the bayou at all public roadway bridges, but legal parking spots may not exist near these bridges.\nOn the east side of Loop 610, Buffalo Bayou passes along the south side of Memorial Park and the north side of River Oaks Country Club, and is accessible to the public along the entire Memorial Park frontage. Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens, the former estate of Houston philanthropist Ima Hogg, is located on the north bank of the bayou just east of Memorial Park. After passing under Shepherd Drive, the waterway enters Buffalo Bayou Park, which is bordered on the north by Memorial Drive and the south by Allen Parkway. The park continues for 2.3 miles (3.7 km) to Interstate 45, where it enters Downtown Houston. The bayou flows past Allen's Landing and joins White Oak Bayou before exiting the central business district at Interstate 69. The bayou widens considerably as it travels through the East End, culminating at the Houston Ship Channel.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early settlement ===\nAlong with Galveston Island and Galveston Bay itself, Buffalo Bayou was one of the focal points for early Anglo-American settlement in early Texas, first part of the Spanish Empire and then part of Mexico. Early communities began to appear at the beginning of the 19th century, including Lynchburg, Harrisburg, and Rightor's Point (modern Morgan's Point) in the 1820s. The bayou became important in Texas history when the final battle for Texas Independence was fought along its banks where it merges with the San Jacinto River.In the 1830s, new communities such as Houston were established along the shoreline. A local entrepreneur named Samuel Allen (unrelated to the founders of Houston) established a large ranch, later known as the Allen Ranch, between Harrisburg and Galveston Bay. Docks at Harrisburg, Houston, and the Allen Ranch gradually became the foundations of what would become the modern Port of Houston. Harrisburg served as the region's major trade center until the 1870s, when a large fire destroyed its railroad facilities, which were subsequently rebuilt in Houston.Houston's original docks, today known as Allen's Landing, were established at the foot of Main Street at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou. The first wharves were opened in 1840, and the Port of Houston was established in 1841. This was the most westerly location a small trading schooner could turn around; without extensive dredging, only small vessels could access the city. This site is now a public park adjacent to the University of Houston\u2013Downtown.\nAfter the Civil War, which bolstered the local economy, dredging became a more viable option. The Bayou Ship Channel Company began major dredging operations in 1870, and the city began receiving federal aid to complete the project. This first dredging of the Buffalo Bayou was completed in 1876.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, the Port of Houston had established itself as the leading port in Texas, eclipsing the natural harbors at Galveston and Texas City. The Turning Basin terminal in Harrisburg (now part of Houston) became the port's largest shipping point. The Texas oil boom of the early 20th century spurred further industrial development.\nExtreme floods in the first half of the 20th century, especially in 1929 and 1935, devastated Downtown Houston and resulted in a number of federally-funded flood control projects in the upper reaches of the watershed. The Texas Legislature created the Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) in 1937, and by the end of the 1930s, over $35 million ($643 million in 2016 dollars) of federal, state, and county funds had been earmarked for an extensive drainage program. In then-rural western Harris County, the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed Barker Reservoir, completed in 1945, and Addicks Reservoir, completed in 1948. Combined, these reservoirs provide 410,000 acre-feet of runoff storage, which has largely prevented downstream flood events. Six miles of Buffalo Bayou between present-day Highway 6 and Beltway 8 was channelized during the construction of the reservoirs. Later, between 1953 and 1958, the stretch between Shepherd Drive and Sabine Street west of Downtown was also straightened. The length of bayou between these two channelized sections, which largely runs through the Memorial Villages, has remained in its natural, meandering state.\n\n\n=== Modern history and revitalization ===\nIn the 1960s, local resident and conservationist Terry Hershey, working with local congressman (and eventual President) George H.W. Bush, prevented the federal government from lining the straightened sections of the bayou with concrete. In 1966, Hershey and a number of other homeowners in the Memorial area formed the Buffalo Bayou Preservation Association, which later expanded its mission and became the Bayou Preservation Association. In 1989, Terry Hershey Park, which runs parallel to the bayou between Beltway 8 and Highway 6, was dedicated to her efforts. The bayou is one of the only bayous in Houston to retain its natural riparian ecosystem.\nFollowing the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, Houston sought to address the untreated sewage that was being discharged into the bayous. The city has invested over $3 billion into new sewers, pumping stations, and sewage treatment plants across the metropolitan area, which has significantly improved water quality in the region.In 1977, Barbours Cut Terminal was opened at Morgan's Point, shifting shipping traffic away from the Turning Basin.\n\nIn 1986, the Buffalo Bayou Partnership, a nonprofit organization, was founded to leverage public and private financing towards renovating and expanding park space along the river. The Partnership's 2002 Buffalo Bayou Master Plan established a 20-year, $5.6 billion vision for the bayou centered on a series of linear parks through central Houston. The project goals include the rehabilitation of formerly industrial land, habitat restoration, canoeing and kayaking facilities, hike-and-bike trails, cultural programming, flood control management, and mixed-use urban development.\nThe Partnership has leveraged over $150 million to implement these projects. The Buffalo Bayou Promenade, opened in 2006, is a 23-acre (9.3-hectare) recreation area with 1.4 miles (2.3 km) of hiking and biking trails extending from Sabine Street west of Downtown to Bagby Street in the Theater District. In 2015, the Partnership completed Buffalo Bayou Park immediately to the west of the Promenade, adding another 160 acres (65 hectares) of renovated parkland along a 2.3-mile (3.7 km) stretch. Buffalo Bayou Park, labeled a \"signature, verdant downtown gateway\" by the Houston Chronicle, includes a dog park, broad lawns, gardens, restaurants, and an art space inside a historic disused cistern. In 2006 the Houston Cistern, managed by the Buffalo Bayou Partnership, started offering historical tours and immersive art exhibits.In August 2017, extensive rainfall from Hurricane Harvey brought the bayou to record high levels, shattering previous flood crests by several feet. Addicks and Barker reservoirs were filled to capacity, forcing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to initiate controlled releases of 16,000 cubic feet per second (450 m3/s) to prevent catastrophic uncontrolled releases and protect the structural integrity of the dams. Despite these efforts, uncontrolled releases did occur around the spillway at the northern end of Addicks Reservoir for the first time in the structure's history.The reservoir releases caused extensive flooding of neighborhoods and roadways along the western stretch of Buffalo Bayou between Barker Reservoir and Downtown; the Memorial area was heavily damaged. The bayou was projected to remain at a major flood stage for up to two weeks after the storm in order to drain the reservoirs as much as possible.\n\n\n== Role of the watershed ==\n\n\n=== Flood control ===\nThe Buffalo Bayou watershed is central to the drainage of Houston and Harris County. Lying over relatively impervious soils and very flat topography, the bayou has extensive natural floodplains, as do most Gulf coastal rivers and streams. Urbanization of the watershed has placed thousands of people in vulnerable areas and has affected the frequency and intensity of flood events.In response to the disastrous flood of 1935, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in association with the Harris County Flood Control District, began an extensive program of reservoir construction, removal of stream-bank vegetation, and channelization to reduce Houston's flooding risk. The two most prominent flood control features in the Buffalo Bayou watershed are the Addicks and Barker reservoirs in western Harris County, which provide a combined 26,000 acres (11,000 hectares) of open land for runoff storage. In recent years, extensive suburban development upstream of the reservoirs has stressed this flood control infrastructure.Since 2015, Buffalo Bayou has experienced three major flooding events, including Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the Tax Day floods of 2016 and a flood on May 26, 2015.\n\n\n=== Recreation and wildlife ===\nBuffalo Bayou is home to numerous urban parks, including George Bush Park (located entirely within Barker Reservoir), Terry Hershey Park, Memorial Park, Buffalo Bayou Park, and Marron Park in the East End. San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site, the site of the Battle of San Jacinto which ended the Texas Revolution, includes the USS Texas, a museum ship permanently moored near the mouth of the bayou.\nThe bayou supports a significant population of catfish, sunfish, gars, and bass for recreational fishing. It includes a population of birds and hosts the popular Waugh Bat Bridge. Alligators have also been spotted along the bayou.\n\n\n==== Navigation ====\nBuffalo Bayou is legally navigable by paddle craft from its source in Katy to the western end of the Ship Channel upstream of Wayside Drive. A majority of paddle trips generally take place between Highway 6 and Shepherd Drive section, with main focus on the section from Briarbend Park to Woodway and to Downtown Houston, generally because of ease of access and length of the trail.The section from Highway 6 to Beltway 8 is known for downed trees, which require frequent portages. The section from Beltway 8 to Briarbend Park is generally kept clear of blockages by the Harris County Flood Control District; however, there are several gravel bar hazards to negotiate during normal water flows. The section from Briarbend Park to Woodway is similarly kept clear, although there may be trees across the waterway immediately after storms.\n\n\n=== Water quality ===\nAs an urban waterway, Buffalo Bayou is especially vulnerable to low water quality. The condition of the bayou's waters has long been a topic of concern in Houston. During the 19th century, the river essentially functioned as both an open sanitary sewer and a source of drinking water. Industrial and agricultural discharge into the water was a common practice, and the bayou took on a reputation as a \"cesspool\" with an \"unbearable stench.\" It was not until the early 20th century that the city had the resources to construct sewerage and sewage treatment plants. However, environmental progress was slow, and Buffalo Bayou was still heavily polluted through the late 1940s.Today, the bayou still faces significant environmental challenges, including elevated levels of indicator bacteria, low oxygen saturation, and heavy nutrient pollution.In February 2019, it was reported that 64,000 gallons of jet fuel leaked into the bayou via the nearby Hobby Airport.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHouston Ship Channel\nPort of Houston\nSan Jacinto River\nList of rivers of Texas\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBuffalo Bayou from the Handbook of Texas Online\nBuffalo Bayou Watershed (Harris County Flood Control)\nUS Army Corps of Engineers Public Notice on the Memorial Park Demonstration Project\nThe University of Houston Digital Library has a collection of historical photographs about Houston, nearby communities, and more.

          "Very nice lineal park that follows the Buffalo Bayou. You have the trail right next to the river and you have the sidewalk of Allen Parkway to choose. There is also a cool dog park in there. Plan accordingly especially if you have children because there are very few restrooms",

          "I grew up in Houston and cannot believe I visited Buffalo Bayou Park for the first time a few days ago. The park is huge, and there are several trails to run and bike. Parking can seem overwhelming, but there is a nice free lot at 150 Sabine (Sabine Promenade). Looking forward",
          "I love fishing and biking so this was the first place where I want to do both. I know that is a really big park and can be difficult to keep it clean, but it is what it really needs.The Park has also a good relationship between nature and downtown, you can literally walk next to",

          "This is a beautiful park in downtown, a short walk from hotels and restaurants. There is a hike & bike path along the bayou that looked well used. The Buffalo Bayou Partnership has a pontoon boat tour which I went on and would highly recommend ($40+tax) that gives the history",
          "I walked here from my hotel, which was about 1.6 miles one way and it was such an easy walk with great pedestrian walkways. It was worth the walk, got a great picture of the city view. I can tell you that it looks better at sunset as the buildings appear to be on fire!",
          "Buffalo Bayou Park is the gem of Houstons great bayou cycling system. It hooks into White Oak Bayou trail, the heights bike path, downtown Houston and is a good launching spot to see all of Houston by bicycle. There is a good healthy type restaurant about in the middle of the",

          "Huge, nice park, for walks, bike rides, picnic and so on if you live in Houston. For vising i would not loose time going there cause there's no much to do. We stopped by, mid day, during the week and there was nobody there.",
          "My husband and I have been exploring the different bike trails around Houston over the last couple of months. Last Saturday morning, we drove from Cypress and parked at the TC Jester Park, and rode 26 miles roundtrip along the White Oak Bayou and Heights Trails and then ended up",
          "Although our navigation system didn\u2019t direct us to any parking, and we had to first find parking space; the park was really beautiful with a great memorial for police. And a beautiful skyline of Houston.",
          "Easily accessible from downtown, the park is a great place to escape the concrete jungle. The walking/running trails on either side of the bayou were easy to navigate and busy first thing in the morning. A worthwhile spot for a walk or run to get the day started.",
          "You can walk around the bayou on the Allen Parkway side, and return on the Memorial side. Or, vice verse. Lots of people bike the paths as well. They are well-kept and clean. Plus, a dog park!!!",

          "This is a great green space. We enjoyed strolling along the river, there is the option to hire bikes if you wish. There is local art you can engage with also. A tour of the cistern is worth it also.",
          "This is a a great big green lung in the city and is widely used by walkers, riders, and recreators generally. There's lots of green space, water, and places to sit and reflect on the day. Cities need places like this. It's the result of a gift from benefactors and seems to be",
          "Great place right in the heart of th city for a bike ride. Ride 5 miles or 40 depending on your wants. Go early in the mornings, before it gets too crowded. Beautiful greenway!",
          "We parked at the lost lake visitor centre. There were a few spaces left although most of them had been blocked off for paid valet parking. We walked back across the main road and hired bikes then rode all the way round the lake. It took just over an hour and the paths are all",
          "we visited this park and dusk and enjoyed a cool walk along the river and among huge shade trees. being from the desert, houston has been an oasis of green spaces and this is another of our favorites",
          "Buffalo Bayou Park is a large expanse of green in the middle of the city, with highways passing on either side of it. It is an elongated park, with many concrete paths for runnings. There is a river running through the centre of the park. There are many bridges connecting",
          "We have just moved close to this park and love to walk on the various trails. Its got such a lot of different areas to walk but also to sit and watch the world go buy. The art is amazing i like how they have structures with names, for example a large structure which spells",

          "They have lovely walk way paths throughout the park. You could almost spend the entire day here if you really wanted to by foot. A lot to see and they have art displays throughout the park as well. A nice entrance into downtown Houston at the end of the park.",
          "We walk on the paths in the park and the traffic noise was overwhelming. From an aesthetic perspective, this was not a very attractive place.",

          "We brought our bike and rode around the park in January...because thats spring like weather in Texas. The only drawback i found was finding a good place to park becasue everyone had the same idea. Dont give up - its a big park and has multiple places to park. you just have to",
          "The Buffalo park was on our way to the Beer can house, so we stopped for a little break. Apart from many jogging and biking paths, this park offers best Houston skyline views. Great photo ops in a pleasant green surroundings.",
          "This park has so many things you can do such as walk or run, play frisbee or toss a football. There are some areas for volley ball as well as a dog park. You can also take your kayak or canoe up or down Buffalo Bayou, weather permitting. Plenty of parking, you will need to pay",
          "We were in Houston for a couple of nights and I saw this park on Trip Advisor so we got there in the beautiful sunshine as the sun was going down on the day we arrived. The park is situated out of the city with a beautiful view of the built up city buildings in the distance.",

          "We only had a few hours in Houston so renting bikes and riding through this park was a great way to see the city and surrounding area while enjoying the park and sunshine. There are bike stations located all over the park, making it easy to rent and ride using the kiosk.",

          "Still in search of some calm and tranquillity in urban Houston - this park isn\u2019t perfect but I found it well worth a visit. A big plus is that it separates bike paths from foot paths, so walkers aren\u2019t in danger of being run over by rogue cyclists. And a huge plus is the Waugh",
          "As a marathon runner, I need somewhere that allows me to cover 8 to 18 miles wherever I go. I once supposed that Houston\u2014a city nearly as devoted to the automobile as LA\u2014would hardly provide what I need. I was wrong. Houston in fact holds its own in big city running amenities\u2014as",

          "We stopped by to have some fun in the city. Parking was hard to get. We drove through the parking spots twice and we ended up parking on a side street. Nice trails with green space everywhere. Downtown skyline in the background is beautiful. We will be coming back to explore",
          "My friend and I love hiking so this park was perfect for everything we wanted to do....its huge, you can rent out bikes, there's a restaurant located in the mist of the park and the skyline views and ponds are beautiful. If you love nature and picnics in the park this is your",

          "Nice, enjoyable pathway to walk, run, or bike. Many parts were wet and muddy but not to the point where you cant pass through. There's a skate park at one end and a bat viewing area at the other! Midway, there's a bridge that has good views of the buildings.",
          "I use to enjoy driving by or walking along the trails, admiring the sculpture, enjoying the water flow, now the trash, silt, toilet paper residue, etc. has caused it to be avoided. Repair will take at least a year, the city inspectors were so backed up that inspections of new",

          "My boyfriend and I set up our lock here during our one year anniversary. It's romantic seeing all the other locks chained together. We come by every now and then when walking our dog just to look out in the city and see our lock. Cheesy but it's what we are",

          "This park is awesome. Very spacious very relaxing. I came here as a tourist to take some pictures of the skyline, but I saw other people who brought their doggies and another couple having a nice little picnic.

          "Cyclists are the main issue with this park. There are pedestrian paths and cyclist paths and every time I go with my dogs, a cyclist will come speeding down the pedestrian path. Idiots!  I wont go back here. There are FAR better places in Houston for Dogs!",

          "It's nice to have something like this in Houston to go running even if you're around downtown but the signage is absolutely ridiculous. there are many options and you never know how to stay on the exact Bike path .  which is maddening and sometimes it just ends and you have to backtrack. they should have done a better job with that",
          "This is a really nice trail and green space.  The bayou is pretty gross and sometimes stinks, but I mean it's Houston so...",

          "Great place to run if you want an endless amount of routes to take. There is no fixed loop, so you can go which ever way you'd like to make it as short or as long as you'd like. If you're really up for it, you can even go from here to memorial park and back for some extra mileage",
          "Lots of walking space, beautifully designed, near me. Lots of people always use this space. Young, old, typical mosaic of Houstonians. And lunch at the Dunlavy is a must.",

Be careful, it would be a shame to have your dog get sick from the dirty water in the puddle",

          "This was a great place to ride one of the BCycles to then get off the bike and stroll down the walking paths. There were a lot of active people in this area and many runners with plenty of nice dogs to say hi too. The entrance to the park had a really nice long slide with natural wooden steps, looked like a blast for kids.",
          "Great for a run, biking, picnic. Park offers everything",

          "Didn\u2019t navigate much of the park, but there was a decent view of downtown that was pretty nice. Monument at the front of the park was neat and had some elevated and underground portions to it. There\u2019s also a creek/river on the side, but was solid brown. Nice for looking, but probably wouldn\u2019t have been great for swimming.",

        "wiki": "The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH), located in the Houston Museum District, Houston, is one of the largest museums in the United States. The permanent collection of the museum spans more than 6,000 years of history with approximately 64,000 works from six continents.The museum benefits the Houston community through programs, publications and media presentations. Each year, 1.25 million people benefit from museum's programs, workshops and resource centers. Of that total, more than 500,000 people participate in the community outreach programs.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nThe MFAH's permanent collection totals 63,718 pieces in 300,000 square feet (28,000 m2) of exhibition space, placing it among the larger art museums in the United States.  The museum's collections and programs are housed in seven facilities. The main buildings (Law and Beck) have 130,000 square feet (12,000 m2) of exhibition space.\n\n\n=== Main Campus ===\nCaroline Wiess Law Building \u2013 the original neo-classical building was designed in phases by architect William Ward Watkin. The original Caroline Wiess Law building was constructed in 1924 and the east and west wing were added in 1926. The Robert Lee Blaffer Memorial Wing was designed by Kenneth Franzheim and opened to the public in 1953. The new construction included significant structural improvements to several existing galleries\u2014most notably, air conditioning. Two subsequent additions, Cullinan Hall and the Brown Pavilion, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe were built in 1958 and 1974 respectively. This section of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston campus is the only Mies-designed museum in the United States. The Caroline Wiess Law building provides an ideal space in which to exhibit the museum's collection of twentieth- and twenty-first-century artworks, as well as installations of Oceanic art, Asian art, Indonesian gold artifacts, and Pre-Columbian and sub-Saharan African artworks. Of special interest is the Glassell Collection of African Gold, the largest assemblage of its kind in the world.\nAudrey Jones Beck Building \u2013 Opened to the public in 2000, the Beck Building was designed by Rafael Moneo, a Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureate and a respected Spanish architect of tremendous range. The museum Trustees elected to name the building after Audrey Jones Beck in honor of the large collection she had donated to the museum several decades prior.\nNancy and Rich Kinder Building \u2013 In 2012, the museum selected Steven Holl Architects over two other finalists, Sn\u00f8hetta and Morphosis, in an international search to design a 164,000 sq ft (15,200 m2) expansion that will primarily hold galleries for art after 1900. The new building will occupy a two-acre museum-owned site that is currently a parking lot. The new MFAH building will be integrated with the adjacent Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen Sculpture Garden and an expanded Glassell School of Art. It will also include 25 galleries for traveling exhibitions, educational areas, a library, lecture halls, a theater and a restaurant. The museum expects the project to cost $250 million to $350 million with the design process taking about two years, followed by five years of construction.\nThe Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen Sculpture Garden \u2013 was designed by US-born artist and landscape architect Isamu Noguchi and opened in 1986. The Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen Sculpture Garden houses more than twenty-five masterworks by some of the most acclaimed artists from the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries from the MFAH and other major collections. The garden itself is a sculpture that unites the pathways between the Caroline Wiess Law Building and the Glassell School of Art.\nGlassell School of Art \u2013 founded in 1979 and designed by architect S. I. Morris, the Glassell School of Art offers programs under the Studio School for Adults. The Glassell School of Art serves as the teaching wing of the MFAH, with a variety of classes, workshops, and educational opportunities for students diverse in age, interests, experience, and needs. In 2014, Steven Holl designed a new L-shaped building for the school, featuring a ramped amphitheatre that leads up to a walkable rooftop garden. In addition to opening onto Noguchi's sculpture garden and providing added outdoor space for programs and performances, the 80,000 sq ft (7,400 m2) building also sits atop an extensive underground parking garage.The school offers classes at the Studio School for Adults and the Glassell Junior School, as well as Community Bridge Programs, special programs for youths, and the Core Artist-in-Residence Program.\n\nCentral Administration and Glassell Junior School of Art Building \u2013 The building, opened in 1994 and designed by Texan architectural designer Carlos Jimenez, houses the museum's administrative functions as well as the Glassell Junior School. The MFAH is the only museum facility in the United States that has a special building dedicated solely to art classes for children.\n\n\n=== Other Facilities ===\nBayou Bend Collection and Gardens \u2013 features one of the nation's finest collections of American decorative art and furniture. The Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens, former home of Life Trustee Ima Hogg, was designed by architect John F. Staub in 1927. Miss Hogg donated the property to the MFAH in 1957, followed, in 1962, by the donation of its collection of paintings, furniture, ceramics, glass, metals, and textiles. Bayou Bend was officially dedicated and opened to the public in 1966. Situated on 14 acres (57,000 m2) of formal and woodland gardens five miles (8 km) from the main museum campus, the historic house museum documents American decorative and fine arts from the seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries. It is esteemed as one of the nation's premier museums of decorative arts.\nRienzi \u2013 the MFAH house museum for European decorative arts, Rienzi was donated to the MFAH by Carroll Sterling Masterson and Harris Masterson III in 1991. The residence, named for Rienzi Johnston, Mr. Masterson's grandfather, is situated on 4.4 acres (18,000 m2) in Homewood Addition, surrounded by Houston's River Oaks neighborhood. The structure was designed in 1952 by John F. Staub, the same architect who designed Bayou Bend. Completed in 1954, Rienzi served as both a family home and a center for Houston civic and philanthropic activity from the 1950s through the mid-1990s. After Mr. Masterson's death, the MFAH transformed the home into a museum and subsequently opened it to the public in 1999\nNidhika and Pershant Mehta Arts of India  - The only space in Houston for Indian Arts Culture. Nidhika and Pershant Mehta, founders and owners of cosmetic and skincare beauty brands Luminess Cosmetics and Conture Skin care, contributed $500,000.00 to build this.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH) is the oldest art museum in Texas. In 1917, the museum site was dedicated by the Houston Public School Art League (later the Houston Art League) with the intention of becoming a public art museum.  The first museum building \u2013 opened to the public in 1924 \u2013 represented the determination of Houstonians to transform their growing city into a rich cultural center.\nTrustees and staff dedicated the small art collection to the community and defined the function of the museum as bringing \u201cart into the everyday life\u201d of all Houstonians. Today the MFAH encompasses two buildings, the Caroline Wiess Law and Audrey Jones Beck buildings, that house its primary collections and temporary exhibitions; two decorative arts house museums; The Glassell studio art school; a sculpture garden; a facility for conservation, storage and archives; and an administrative building with the Glassell Junior school of Art\nPrior to the opening of the permanent museum building in 1924, George M. Dickson bequeathed to the collection its first important American and European oil paintings. In the 1930s, Houstonian Annette Finnigan began her donation of antiquities and Texas philanthropist Ima Hogg gave her collection of avant-garde European prints and drawings. Ima Hogg's gift was followed by the subsequent donations of her Southwest Native American and Frederic Remington collections during the 1940s. The same decade witnessed the 1944 bequest of eighty-three Renaissance paintings, sculptures and works on paper from renowned New York collectors Edith and Percy Straus.\nOver the next two decades, gifts from prominent Houston families and foundations concentrated on European art from the fifteenth to twentieth centuries, contemporary painting and sculpture, and African, Oceanic and Pre-Columbian art. Among these are the gifts of Life Trustees Sarah Campbell Blaffer, Dominique de Menil and Alice N. Hanzsen as well as that of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation. Augmented by museum purchases, the permanent collection numbered 12,000 objects by 1970.\n\nThe MFAH collection nearly doubled from 1970 to 1989, fueled by continued donations of art along with the advent of both accession endowment funding and corporate giving. In 1974, John and Audrey Jones Beck placed on long-term loan fifty Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces, augmenting the museum's already strong Impressionist collection. This collection would never leave the MFAH, formally entering its holdings in 1998 as a gift of Life Trustee Audrey Jones Beck. The collection is permanently displayed in the building that bears her name. On the heels of the Cullen Foundation's funding of the MFAH's first accessions endowment in 1970, the Brown Foundation, Inc., launched a challenge grant in 1976 that would stay in effect for twenty years raising funds for both accessions and operational costs in landmark amounts and providing incentive for additional community support. Also in 1976, the photography collection was established with Target Stores\u2019 first corporate grant to the museum. Today the museum is the sixth-largest in the country.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nWith more than 62,000 works of art, the majority of the museum's collection lie in the areas of Italian Renaissance painting, French Impressionism, photography, American and European decorative arts, African and pre-Columbian gold, American art, and post-1945 European and American painting and sculpture. Other facets of the collection include African-American art and Texas painting. Emerging collection interests of modern and contemporary Latin American art, Asian art, and Islamic art continue to strengthen the museum's collection diversity. As a result of its encyclopedic collection, the museum ranks nationally among the top ten art museums in attendance.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Management ==\nPhilippe de Montebello directed the museum from 1969 to 1974. During the 28-year tenure of Peter Marzio between 1982 and 2010, the Museum of Fine Arts\u2019 yearly attendance increased to roughly two million from 300,000; its operating budget climbed to $52 million from $5 million, and its endowment reached $1 billion (before the 2008 recession dropped its value to about $800 million). The museum's permanent collection more than tripled in size, to 63,000 works from 20,000. In 2010, Marzio was the sixth-highest-paid charity chief executive in the country, with compensation in 2008 of $1,054,939. A year after Peter Marzio died in 2010, Gary Tinterow was appointed as the museum's director.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBayou Bend Collection and Gardens\nIma Hogg\nSamuel Henry Kress\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPhotographs from the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, hosted by the Portal to Texas History.\nInternational Center for the Arts of the Americas at MFAH\nThe Museum of Fine Arts, Houston - The Adolpho Leirner Collection of Brazilian Constructive Art at Google Cultural Institute",

          "Excellent fine arts collection. The portrait art really stands out as some of the best work in the museum.",
          "I loved roaming the many galleries of European art, from the Medieval to contemporary. I was also amazed at the amount of East Asian, Indian, and Islamic art they had as well. This might be a two day trip though, it's easy to get \"visual fatigue\" in a place like this.",
          "We went to Norman Rockwell exhibit. was amazing and enjoyed the history lesson from early days, thru wars and peace.",
          "Our first trip to the Museum of Fine Arts was a most enjoyable experience. We were thoroughly impressed with the way we were introduced to a few works and were immediately directed through a striking and sobering photo exhibit of the Great Depression and World War II that gave",

          "Went here by chance as the natural history and science museum was closed for the day. Lovely place. Had some heat paintings but also exhibits from Italian furniture to Egyptian, Japanese, Indonesian exhibits. WEL worth a few hours of your time",
          "Beautiful exhibits and paintings. Very friendly staff. Helpful front desk associates. Coat check was helpful and appreciated.",
          "Like many metropolitan at museums the MFAH has a fine permanent collection. What drew us in were the temporary exhibitions which cover a wide variety of interests. If you live in the area and plan on multiple visits a season pass is well worth it as it provides discounted",
          "Great exhibit that included more than Norman Rockwell. It places his art in the historical perspective, including other artists\u2019 works. The WPA photography is not to be missed. The exhibit also shows some artwork from conception, through Rockwell\u2019s process, to finished",
          "We purchased two adult tickets to see the two exhibitions and it came to $50. It was nicely set up but also crowded on a Sunday to really get close enough to see the pieces of art. They handout individual audio devices which makes people linger longer than normal at each piece",
          "This is a very interesting museum. I was here with my daughter and had a very good time enjoying their exhibits.",
          "Great way to spend a few hours. Reasonable admission. The permanent collection is great and varied. Plenty to keep adults and kids entertained. Events every weekend for kids. Easy access to parking near-by. Beautiful area with parks and other attractions within walking",

          "The MFA is a fine museum with a variety of artwork and sculpture to satisfy anyone\u2019s taste. The collections are well-organized and the signage for individual paintings and other art objects is almost uniformly excellent. The food served at the cafeteria is very good by museum",

          "We had time to kill before heading to the airport and my husband is an artist so we spend a few hours here. Fist of all, this part of Houston is gorgeous! Huge old homes, beautiful green areas and wonderful statues and fountains. It puts you in the mood to look at beautiful",

          "We've been members of the MFAH for years. They have a fantastic permanent collection that includes everything from ancient artifacts to Impressionist masters. There are some nice surprises as well; our favorite is the light tunnel by James Turrell that connects the museum's two",
          "What an opportunity this was to see the layout of the building and to enjoy the various galleries. The Rockwell Exhibition showing of the Four Freedoms was incredible.There was a lot of his art some of which I had never seen before. It covered his early years and his techniques.",
          "It's a great place to visit if you have a day free. I would recommend going if you have at least a few hours to spend because there is a lot to see. Especially nice if you have to spend some time alone :)",
          "I took my granddaughter to the museum as she was off for the MLK holiday. She is 17 and loves to paint and draw but also photography. We toured much of the main collection and then did the special Norman Rockwell exhibit. The special exhibit was good, we got the free audio sets",
          "Considering cost of tickets for a special collection, we were very disappointed. Didn\u2019t have many paintings by artist showcased at all. Overpriced gift shop, as well as cafe.",
          "Ok! we were in the convention center and needed something to do in our free time. Found the MFA, and noted two special exhibits: Monet to Picasso and Norman Rockwell so we took the tram (4 blocks from our hotel) and it stopped just in front of the MFA. The Monet to Picasso was",

          "The Van Gogh exhibit was outstanding!! Not to mention the rest of the museum, the gift shop and cafe. MFAH has evolved into a national treasure and a destination not to be missed.",
          "Another museum with too much empty space. Terrible map provided and zero signage to direct visitors. The Van Gogh exhibit was very good and worth the extra $40. Other than that, we found the experience disappointing. They need to do a much better job of helping visitors",
          "At a very moderate entrance price you can stroll around here for 2-3 hours Nice collection of paintings and modern art The temporary collections while i was there were great. I liked the set up and the space Certainly a must visit if you want a good overview of artists through",

          "This exhibit just opened this weekend. It's a wonderful exhibit and a little different from other exhibits, in that his art is presented chronologically. Most people, including myself, do not realize that Van Gogh only painted for 10 years. Imagine what he could have done had he",

          "The MFAH is one of my all time favorite places to go in Houston. Parking is easy and feels safe in the adjoining garage. The museum has a nice little cafe for lunch or a quick snack. Special exhibitions are often held and are by far the most enjoyable part of the museum.",
          "The museum was too large for us to see it all in the three hours we had available, but the art we saw was worth the visit. I tend to gravitate to the Impressionist paintings, and they had much to interest me. The caf\u00e9 in the basement also has nice salads.",

          "There were a few buildings to cover. When I was there, there was an exhibition relating to the British royalty, from the National Portrait Gallery in London. I had no interest in this, being Irish. The rest was excellent however, especially the Asian art exhibits. Well worth it.",
          "We used the MOFA for a meeting. Such a nice change from the usual business venues. A little basic, but fresh air and a lovely verandah. Amazing art to look at. Don\u2019t use hotels. Use MOFA. Thank you to the staff.",

          "Great art. Mostly modern though and I prefer the classics. Still worth a visit",
          "I love the Fine Arts Museum of Houston.  There are some great permanent exhibits, and there are always fantastic traveling exhibits.  One can spend days in the museum and not truly take it all in.",
          "Beautiful place to appreciate art! If you're a lover of any type of art or cultural objects this is the place for you! Expand your artistic side of your brain and learn something new!!!",
          "Today was my first visit to the MFA Houston, to view the Van Gogh exhibit. I went within the first hour on a Saturday and it was crowded due to it being a special exhibit. The staff was very helpful in directing us toward ticketing and the exhibit itself. There was $10 parking garage nearby, very convenient.",
          "A perfect place for art lovers to visit the Museum for fine arts Houston in Bissonnet st,near Hermann park or Museum district metro station. Good artifacts related to painting and sculpture can be seen here. Intricate sculpted vases,chests \u2026",
          "Cool place. Great area.  Cheap to get in.",
          "It's always so perfect, from the choice of collections to the bathrooms. But the food is Bland.",
          "Big and with a considerable variety in its expositions. It counts with renowned artists like Monet and Van Gongh",
          "I highly recommend the MFAH. The exhibits are top notch. I especially like their photography exhibits. Recently they curated an exhibit by Sally Mann which was awesome. Photographer Sally Mann explores what it means to be Southern. For more \u2026",
          "Thursday is free all day! It's like $10 for parking, great way to spend the day with the whole fam",

          "Absolutely stunning!  Offers free museum day weekly.  Lots of people to assist as there are actually two buildings.  Be sure to visit across the street or walk through art tunnel.  Plus there is  art in an outside park.  Lovely downstair \u2026",
          "The museum had something for everyone. I only wished I had more time to visit. No need to purchase tickets on-line, you have to wait on the line to get your tag.",
          "We love coming back here every time there is a special gallery! So many things to see and do, each time we go we discover something new! Definitely worth the trip!",
          "I went to see the Van Gogh exhibit with a friend and it was FANTASTIC! We especially enjoyed the end portion where there was interactive exhibit of his art.",
          "I love art and this museum has all kinds of it. So much to see and awesome that it's free on Thursdays. Fun time to see all they have to offer and staff is really friendly and informative.",

          "Great place to spend time with family",
          "Large museum with a world class collection. There are multiple buildings with tunnels, stairs and escalators connecting some of them. This building system could use a better map or visitor guide. Still, don't hesitate to visit.",
          "Fine arts and staff very helpful",
          "Overall great experience. Chose not to pay extra for some of the exhibits and was glad when I saw them.",
          "Every Thursday the museum is complementary to the public.  It\u2019s a great place to immerse yourself with the origins and history from which the art came from.  There\u2019s a lot to see and plenty to learn.   Parking can be a headache.  They took \u2026",
          "Revamped! Great exhibits.  Tasty Cafe.",
          "WOW! Houstonians have some heavenly treasure boxes in the world of art. I am an artist who is grateful for the love-life of shared beauty building genuinely compassionate community. Houston is leading with World Class Style!",
          "Great display!  Great exhibit on royal family history.  Need to have more time to enjoy all exhibits, otherwise it would be pricey to only spend few hours in there.\nGift shop items were all overly priced.",
          "The best museum in Houston.",
          "Very nice buildings. I am not into art. Took my daughter because she has an art appreciation class paper to do. The art I do like is sculpture and realistic painting. Some very nice peices.",
          "World class art museum.   Excellent exhibitions as well as a vast permanent collection spread across two buildings.  There is an art school and sculpture garden as well.  Highly recommend!",
          "Always see something new. The museum also has new exhibits frequently and sometimes special events like van Gogh. Friendliest staff. Good little food court in the lower level. Can sometimes be hard to navigate is the only minor criticism. Thursday is also free!",
          "Very artsy. Lots of really good paintings. Way better than anything I could do.",
          "This was my first time here. I'm not an art enthusiast but still enjoyed myself. Went on a Thursday (free in summers) and it wasn't too crowded. Definetly a neat place!",
          "BEST art museum in Houston with exhibits, exhibitions,displays for all ages. Leave extra time for street parking (limited). ADA compliant.You can check it out free on Thursdays but well worth admission price. Quality cafe. Many events held \u2026",
          "In all it was fun but I was extremely disappointed by the African art display including the pieces there, and how difficult it was to find it was basically hidden",
          "New experience, must visit at least once. Beautiful sights.",
          "Beautiful pieces and serves a mean expresso",
          "Nice place. Free on Thursdays.",
          "You have to go for the van Gogh exhibit. It's stunning and super interesting too. It's not difficult to see that the Museum put a lot of effort into making sure there was a journey that the viewer could follow and emerge from bearing a \u2026",
          "Nice experience to be able to walk indoors when it's hot outside. A lot of different things to look at but some seem to repeat a lot",
          "Went specifically to see the Van Gogh exhibit. Was not disappointed! It was a very large collection with all of his work represented. The \"hands on\" room gave a chance to actually take pictures and pose IN his art, draw, and really get inside of a painting. Didn't get to explore the rest of the museum extensively but will be back!",
          "Really nice. It took us almost 4 hours to go through it all, which is a great and detailed museum without going through the additional exhibits. \n\nYou need an easy 2 hours to go through the levels and both buildings.",
          "Very organized, enjoyed my visit very much.",
          "By the time you've looked at every work they have here, they will have replaced some of the ones you previously looked at with new ones... infinite art",
          "Had a terrific time seeing the Van Gogh exhibit with my Church family. Plan on visiting more often, it was to much to see with the time we had. Ate a nice lunch in the cafeteria downstairs. Everyone I encountered was pleasant and knowledgeable about the exhibits.",
          "Wonderful museum with rotating exhibits and a great collection.",
          "First time patron.  I love museums; have been to some of the finest in Europe and the US. This one is probably the 1st one I've been to that I wouldn't recommend.  Large spaces, but not alot of inventory, not enough places to sit and take \u2026",
          "Very affordable with lots to see. If you love art you should totally visit! They have a sculpture garden too and beautiful pieces by well known artists. It is a great rainy day activity or weekend relaxer. They offer lots of discounts so I \u2026",
          "I came here with my partner for free and I had a fun time! But even on the non discount days we have student discount! There are so many works of art and weird cool stuff to experience at this museum. I went through their bamboo stick exhibit and it was awesome! Perfect place for a date!",
          "Always a delight to visit and enjoy the new exhibits. We don't live close enough to visit on a weekly basis but I know that if we did, we would be there.\n\nAn environment for the whole family. A beauty.",
          "This is a great place to visit in Houston. My husband and I came for the Van Gogh exhibit and really enjoyed it, although our favorite parts were the African and South American. It's in a great area with fairly easy parking. We also had a quick walk through the sculpture garden, which was nice as well.",
          "I love MFAH!  Such good exhibits, always have loved it here. I need a membership again asap!",
          "Great on Thursday when it's free.",
          "I like the manager came out to talk with me about my pork allergy. The food looked lovely. But my husband's Caesar salad was floating in salad dressing (he loved his blackened salmon, however). And I found my fish to be delicious, except \u2026",
          "I had such a lovely time visiting yesterday. It was well worth it.",
          "Love, love, love MFAH! They have fantastic exhibits that come through and I also have attended some of their special events. These pictures were from the Van Gogh exhibit and interactive section. I loved it so much I went twice!",
          "Great little museum in the heart of Houston.",
          "World Class I could live there",
          "What an incredible Museum! We went for the Vincent Van Gogh showing. After this we stayed and visited the rest of the museum. I would recommend visiting often!",
          "We only had time to visit the blockbuster van Gogh exhibit and it was all that was promised. There were not only the great paintings, but the drawings that helped explain the artist's progression in his career. It was worth the trip to Houston to see this as it will not be shown anywhere else.",
          "A fine collection of art from all over the world.  I highly recommend stopping by if you are in Houston.",
          "Wonderful tour....\"Who is like the Sovereign Lord!\"",
          "I love museum and the Houston Museum of Fine Arts is probably one of the best in the country. They have several massive rooms full of art from all different eras going back thousands of years. They have stuff from ancient Egypt and Greece. \u2026",
          "Beautiful collection. Hard to find information upon entry. No real lobby? Museum guards weren't as helpful as I'm used to at the National Gallery, for example.",
          "Tourist in the area, and this was a nice museum to go and visit! Several floors and two different building that you can explore in. I feel like most of the collections don't change, but there is a large exhibit that is updated about every 3 \u2026",
          "Great part of town. Lots of trees and a gorgeous building. Right next to the zoo. And across the street from a great hotel and restaurant. Lots to see and do. There is an entrance fee but if you read their website certain conditions can be \u2026",
          "Go to place to hang out/walk around when I'm in the area. I've been coming here for years, mostly just to look at the free exhibits, and there's always hours of stuff to look at and read about. The oil paintings are my favorite. I suggest \u2026",
          "Beautiful museum. I truly enjoyed it, especially the sculptures. Definitely recommend to come for a visit. We came on a Thursday, free admission, it wasnt packed at all.",
          "This museum is HUGE and houses tons of beautiful works of art from ancient Egyptian sarcophagi to modern pieces. I was there for several hours and felt like I just scratched the surface of all there was to see! I spent a lot of time viewing \u2026",
          "A beautiful museum with unique displays. There was plenty to keep me interested for hours. I know digital art is here to stay-I don't get it as \"fine\" art. My opinion. \nI would say this is a must on a visit to Houston. I was visiting a \u2026",
          "We are members of the museum and it is well worth it.  The quality and diversity of the exhibits will impress. Give it a go on a Thursday when there is free admission.\n\nThere are also great limited time exhibits that pass through. Here are a few pictures from the Tudor to Windsor exhibit.",
          "Worked an event at the museum so I didn't see many exhibits. \nWhat I did see I liked and the food served was pretty good. \nWould definitely go back in my free time.",
          "Wonderful exhibits. Lots of hands on activities and enlightening demonstrations. A mustvisit if you get to Houston.",
          "If you love art it's one of the best places in Texas. A mix of classic and modern and majority of the time there's a great exhibition too.",
          "This review is mainly for the sculpture garden across the street from the museum. The sculptures are exquisite. I recommend this for anyone. It is free and beautiful. There is also the Cloud Column that is quite a sight. It is from the same sculptor as the Bean in Chicago.",
          "Can\u2019t get enough of this place \ud83d\ude0d so in love with it.\nAll the staff are very friendly and the lego exhibit is the best so far.",
          "This is a nice museum in the Museum District of Houston, and the staff and security guards were friendly and well-informed. I saw the Van Gogh exhibit on display, which, unsurprisingly, was extremely crowded (we waited in line about an hour \u2026",
          "Have had a membership here for many years. Always amazed by the wide variety of people attending the exhibits: all ages and stages, multiple ethnicities, families, date nights, friend groups, etc. Most recent new exhibit is wonderful \u2026",
          "Went for the van Gogh exhibit and loved it. This is a great museum that everyone in the family could enjoy! It was very crowded the day we went, with people of all ages!",
          "Free on Thursday. Cold AC and fantastic exhibits. Great time to use your money for an added attraction.",
          "One of America's best.  I'm a bit of a museum hoochie in general of all types.  I have grown to appreciate it more and more now that I have traveled pretty extensively.",
          "The Van Gogh exhibit was amazing. \ud83d\ude0d We got the dual membership which was very worth it! Will definitely be visiting more.",
          "The collection is a diverse, carefully selected cross section of human cultures, highlighting the amazing diversity of arts across the globe.  This is a museum not to be missed.",
          "A world class museum \nExhibitions bringing  everything from impressionists to royal portraits of Great Britain. You  will want to see again and again. A permanent collection that is outstanding . A campus which is expanding and impressive. \u2026",
          "We came all the way  to Houston to see the Van Gogh exhibit. We will have to come back  another day because the line was down the street and out the door. Wow! We had already waited  about 30 min to purchase our tickets. They didn't tell us \u2026",
          "Get there early, especially for special exhibits. Preferably right when they open in order to avoid the long lines. That will give you time to see more of the rest of the museum afterwards. You won't be able to see everything in one day though.",
          "You can definitely spend more time here than you would expect. It\u2019s well laid out and has plenty to explore.",
          "Beautiful facility with interesting exhibits from all over the world.",
          "Honestly a pretty amazing place with a very friendly and knowledgeable staff parking is not great but that's true for all of Houston",
          "I just love this museum. It's a great place to sit and appreciate beautiful art.",
          "Hard to find parking. But it has some nice artworks. But not at the level of others world class museum. Too complicate to walk or drive",
          "Beautiful! I enjoyed the serene environment and great displays,  especially the Houston artist's work",
          "Very interesting groups of permanent exhibits and usually has a very good special exhibit. Right now there is a Van Gogh exhibit that focuses on the techniques he used rather than on his famous spectacular colorful pictures. His self taught techniques are extremely impressive.",
          "I went in to work on a class project and ended up spending 3 hours enjoying the beauty of this museum. \nEveryone was so helpful and kind, especially the front desk staff. The works of art were all beautiful and wonderful appointed. I will be returning with friends to enjoy this wonderful environment.",
          "Great exhibits and a good way to spend an afternoon.",
          "Good place for the whole family,I'LL BE BACK",
          "Amazing food in the cafe, good to spend a whole day there, only complaint is the works of motion kind of exibit was just one interactive piece that was fun but for ten dollars not worth it.",
          "Wow, Vincent at his finest! Well laid out and the  audio was very informative. Great Show!",
          "Great museum. I'm very familiar with the permanent collection.There is also a lovely sculpture garden to walk through & roof top terrace above the parking garage. The staff was friendly & polite.",
          "Thursday is free\nDifferent expositions every season",
          "Super fun, even to take the kids to. The environment was quiet, but there were all sorts of artwork and artifacts from all different cultures and eras of history. There was just too much to take in all in one day! We will definitely be back again and again.",
          "I went on a Thursday night and I had a great time. There are many interesting paintings and sculptures to see while you walk around. Make sure that you come early because finding a parking spot can be a little tricky. I would recommend this anyone.",
          "A great day spent with my daughter for my birthday. So special",
          "I'm there for tacos Delicious",
          "Superb.  I took two friends from Washington State there last week.  They spent three hours there and would have stayed longer, but it was 9 PM and closing time.  They loved it.  So many wonderful exhibits.  Thursdays are free, thanks to \u2026",
          "Great for when you wann time travel to the past, also great first date, alot to talk about",
          "One of my favorites place to go with friends and family. Always very good exhibitions",
          "One of the most diverse collections in the country.",
          "The museum has quite a few interesting pieces to see, but I didn't quite feel it was worth the price. I strongly advise going on a Thursday when it's free. There also were nowhere as many things to see as I had thought there would be.",
          "Fantastic museum. Love the exhibits fun for the whole family.",
          "Disappointed in their latest exhibitions. The Van Gogh exhibition has a few iconic works but the rest was so lackluster. I absolutely loved the interactive room set up with Van Gogh's  iconic bedroom and so much more. This alone was worth \u2026",
          "Great museum featuring a lot of artworks ranging from early and medieval art to modern installations.",
          "First time back in a while. My husband and I didn't realize it was free every Thursday.  Thank you",
          "This is a box of surprise hidden at a street corner in Houston. Love there collection of painting and have revisited many a times.",
          "Nice museum place to visit.\nConveniently located for public transportation.",
          "Cultural star. Educational yet fun.",
          "The Art Museum of Houston is beautiful. However the staff was bias. They told us (Hispanics) backpacks were not allowed when we saw a bunch of other people passed by with theirs own and they were not told anything!",
          "Fun and you learn stuff. Parking is a complete MESS as they have torn up the prior parking across the street. Give youself at least an extra 20 min to deal with.",
          "Van Gogh exhibition is so well done. It is a great study of 10 years of creativity. Go see and listen to it and you will love it too.",
          "The Museum of Fine Arts Houston is always a great place to spend a weekend afternoon, and a good place to escape the summer heat!! Interesting exhibits that change frequently so you never get tired of going back.",
          "Lovely. Get there early so the construction doesn't affect parking. Very helpful staff. We had a wheelchair and they went out of their way to help us get to see everything.",
          "Talking about the van Gogh exhibit it was AMAZING! As a plus they offer you audioguides that are so helpful. The thing that I like the most was the chronological sequence of the exhibit in which you can clearly see the progression of the artist.",
          "Attended for Van Gogh exhibit which was Amazing and well done, then wandered the other floors. Total exhibit time- about 2 1/2 hours. Ate in the cafe- pricey and a long wait but good food. Parking can be a challenge. Print the map and have options available if nearest lots are full.",
          "I loved it! My first time ever here. I found it interesting that they had reproduction pieces but I was glad to see they actually had some original work to enjoy. \nI like the fact that you can have those little things to tell you about the \u2026",
          "Amazing! Went to see the Van Gogh exhibit. I had a really great time and thought the museum handled the crowds of people very well. The rest of the museum is very pretty and entertaining. Anybody could spend their day here.",
          "Very factual. Was a bit boring. Maybe because we got lost and spent more time looking for a way around then the art.",
          "Excellent art exhibits.",
          "The Glassell Collections were so beautifully curated. I wish I had more time to digest it all when I went. I would definitely go back, but I wish they'd allow for more convenient parking in this area. It was a bit of a squeeze.",
          "Went to the Van Gogh exhibit. Enjoyed it.  Only exception were the prints of Van Gogh's paintings instead of the actual paintings. Over half of the exhibit was prints.  As much as they charge per person you'd think they could afford more of the actual paintings, which is what I thought I was paying for!",
          "Always PERFECT!!! Amazing exhibitions and so many programs and artist. In this moment the Best of the Best is Vince Van Gogh Exhibition. If you're in the Houston don't lose the opportunity with this one. Especially the Close up. Even if you're not an art person you'll love it.",
          "My family went here to see the Van Gogh exhibit.  We REALLY enjoyed it! Better yet, we were able to see a piece of art by Mark Rothko! The variety of famous painters was top notch!",
          "breathtaking. no other words. the  Van Gogh exhibit was awesome",
          "good variety of arts pieces of time, form , area, and style.",
          "I have read reviews on here about moms with their children being followed around by the security guards at the museum. It is uncomfortable and makes the visit very unpleasant. This happened to me. A museum staff person responded right away \u2026",
          "Excellent museum, lots of things to see. You must go on a thursday for a free ticket",
          "Went to the van Gough exhibit. Like a lot of the traveling exhibits, it had lots of less famous bit really cool stuff that I had never seen. Like the museum. Remember that it has two buildings.",
          "Exciting place to learn about other cultures",
          "Lots to look at and admire and that was my just one building",
          "We went to see the Van Gogh Exhibit. The paintings were beautiful and nicely displayed but the crowd made almost impossible to spend any real time viewing the work. Also, as I\u2019m in a wheelchair, people crowding around a piece made difficult to see.",
          "Amazing Art Museum wit featuring contemporary art exhibitions touring through Houston.",
          "Wonderful experience! There is also a lovely sculpture garden to walk through & roof top terrace above the parking garage. The staff was friendly & polite.",
          "Loved the audio walk thru.",
          "Beautiful museum with a very wide variety of art!",
          "The Van Gogh exhibit was amazing. I really enjoyed learning more details about his life. The display of his favorite artist tools was one of many favorites.",
          "What a wonderful experience! The most recent exhibition was amazing. We didn\u2019t finish seeing everything in one day because of how huge the museum is. I recommend you go early to avoid the afternoon crowd. The world history and beautiful art \u2026",
          "We saw the Van Gogh exhibit. Great collection. Also went through other collections.  I like this museum.",
          "Excellent place to see a little bit of everything.",
          "Beautiful, large, well-organized and planned fine arts museum. Educational, varied. We visited a special Van Gogh  exhibit created created in collaboration with international museums. We learned about his life and experienced that as well as his artistic development through this beautiful exhibit. A wonderful afternoon!",
          "Consistently an outstanding venue for visual and interactive art pieces.",
          "The Van Gogh exhibit was amazing. The museum its self is fantastic although confusing. I feel like i missed some thing with the way its laid out.",
          "An Amzing place to visit even if you are not into arts. Went there as part of a research assignment for an elective class and didnt expect to enjoy it as much as I did. It's not just about painting and sculptures, it was more than that. \u2026",
          "Great artwork to see! Every room was filled with treasures beautifully displayed. It was free on Thursday and I love my freebies! I loved the Korean room",
          "I'm sure there are 3 page reviews about this place, so I am gonna keep this real short. I went to 8 art galleries downtown. This one and 1 other was the best I've ever been to. Needless to say you need to check this one out! If you don't want to pay come in on a Thursday. Students get in halve off as well on the other days.",
          "Amazing collection of artwork and exhibits. This is a perfect place to hang out with friends or take someone on a date. The collections and exhibits are wide ranging and constantly being changed which makes this not only a one time visit but a place you can visit every few months to experience new art.",
          "Van Gogh exhibit and interactive room was AWESOME! Be prepared for crowds on weekends, or go during the week to escape the bustle. Love it! This place always feels like home",
          "I love taking my students here. They have a broad range of styles and cultures that inspire and interest just about anyone. Fascinating collection on its own, but the Van Gogh exhibition was fantastic!",
          "I've gone a handful of times now, mostly just to see the exhibits. Saw the royals exhibit and the Van Gogh exhibit, and stuff a few years ago. Impressive collections and worth a visit, whether you're from here or just visiting. Lines can be long for exhibits, especially on Saturdays.",
          "Beautiful artwork; confusing layout; expensive gift shop",
          "Always changing but it is a LOT of walking. Be prepared to spend a whole day if you're an art lover.",
          "Fun and amazing!  Been going here for a very long time, and plan on always coming back!",
          "This is always a good place to escape. Today I visited the Van Gogh exhibit. Very interesting to read into the mind of a fantastic artist. Must see!",
          "We came for the Bamboo exhibit. The price of admission varies but does offer general admission to the museum as well. We paid for parking in the museum garage a block away.  First 30 minutes are free. And it's worth it to keep your car cool \u2026",
          "Huge museum.  We went when the Van Gogh exhibit was there and it was worth the extra fee.  The only downside was that some of the museum attendants were overzealous and would tell people to step back when they were 2 feet away from an exhibit.  That was irritating.  Art from all over the world.  The African area was awesome.",
          "We have only been once as we wanted to see a specific exhibit.  It is very interesting place to visit but not necessarily family friendly if you have little ones in tow. The closest restroom was hard to find and did not have a changing \u2026",
          "Great museum.  Really impressed.   Staff was helpful and very polite.  Ron",

          "Went for the Van Gogh exhort. It was a nice experience. I liked the room they had where kids could explore the Van Gogh art with their hands. The museum is big so give yourself at least 2 hours of not more to look around. Don\u2019t forget they \u2026",

          "Good collection of pieces.",
          "The Van Gogh exhibit was a little crowded but the service was amazing. Anytime we asked someone who worked at the museum a question we where greeted with a smile. I do wish they had not closed the van Gogh inspired fashion exhibit before the full exhibit but aside from the special exhibits the permanent collection was wonderful.",
          "The museum is basically just that, it is a museum. They do have a good building design, and art pieces that make for an enjoyable time. Thursday is free, so that's when everyone brings their kids, so it does get a little loud. but otherwise, I had a relatively good time",

          "Great museum but could use happier customer service",
          "It took an hour to get into the Vincent VanGogh exhibit.  It wasn't their best effort...I've seen them do better.  But, it was still pretty amazing.",
          "Nice surprise, Thursdays are free! This place is great for a day trip",
          "Well I figure the arts to be political driven hipsters and while yes they are there they usually not in the classical or romantic parts of the exhibits Wich gives you time to admire the views without worry there going to comment or attack you for your maga hat",
          "The updated newly renovated grounds behind the museum is one of the nicest new attractions in Houston.  Start by viewing the ring that seems to be the same artist who did the bean in Chicago.  There is a mini amphitheater that has steps \u2026",
          "Top notch world class art museum.",
          "I absolutely love the rotating exhibits! The membership is totally worth it of you plan to visit at least 2 exhibits within a year. It pays for itself! And the discounted parking, discount in the gift shops, and member previews are an added \u2026",

          "Not as good as Dallas's or KC Museums of Fine Art.",
          "This is the Museum of Fine Arts Houston. There's just so many things to see during the day, and plenty of events.",
          "Van Gogh exhibit with some lesser know works and a couple of classics.  One whole room is reproductions... Which is frustrating, as is the way the audio tour is set up where you have to climb over people to access audio.  Interactive kids' room is best part.",
          "Cool quiey place, very houston place to ciatit if you havent. Free on thursdays. Helpful staff. Art was just.. Fine..",
          "Nice setup and plenty of different exhibits including Greek and Roman. The Egyptian exhibit was small; however the African was intricate and elaborate. Parking is somewhat difficult. I'd recommend riding the train if possible. Overall, nice experience",
          "Always the best! Smile. Relax. Enjoy!",
          "Such beauty within these walls! I went for Vincent Van Gogh special event (which was extremely well-done), but left equally impressed with other items in the collection.",

          "Great museum.  Go visit for a very nice experience.",

          "Beautiful Museum, need a couple of trips to see everything",

          "The  Sarofim Campus is spacious and feels like a classic art museum.",
          "I like the atmosphere  in this  museum",

          "It amazes me to know that we don\u2019t have to travel to other countries to appreciate the art of some of the most talented artists!! Every summer we delight in spending an afternoon at the museum enjoying art! This year we went to see Vincent \u2026",
          "Top notch traveling and permanent exhibits. The staff are very helpful and customer service oriented.",
          "- A unique, tunneled system for a museum!    - Updating is needed- bathrooms had older features and were probably crawling with germs. \n- They don't offer a teachers discount.\n- Light tunnel was different.\n- Van Gogh exhibit was well thought out.",

          "Lovely exhibits with beautiful artwork everywhere! The cafeteria's food is pretty good too.",
          "Beautiful museum! Huge place w 3 floors I believe. Many different exhibits and idk how but today (Thurs) it was free. Also parking was free def worth checking out. Cool place to take pics however it seems everyone's more worried about using the lighting here to take selfies than the museum itself. Has a few pokestops too.",
          "It\u2019s art, darling! Feeling like you need some culture in your life? Think it\u2019s too dang humid for outdoor activities in Houston? Want to clear your mind and relax a little? Then this is the place to go! Though there is a caveat to that \u2026",
          "We LOVED the Vincent Van Gogh exhibit! This museum has so much to offer. They also had a section for kids involving the Van Gogh exhibit. MFAH has events year round, a classroom for kids classes, a free day to see the permanent art and even a disco night for adult that includes the art. There is always something fun and exciting to do!",
          "Really liked the exhibition (The British Royal Family). The museum is wheelchair accesible which is great.Their MFA cafe is fantastic. Try their Italian hot chocolate if you like that and you won't be disappointed.",

        "wiki": "The Houston Museum District is an association of 19 museums, galleries, cultural centers and community organizations located in Houston, Texas, dedicated to promoting art, science, history and culture.\nThe Houston Museum District currently includes 19 museums that recorded a collective attendance of over 8.7 million visitors a year. All of the museums offer free times or days and 11 of the museums are free all the time. Thursdays the Museum District gets particularly crowded because of museum free days. On Thursdays, The Houston Museum of Natural Science is free after 2 p.m., The Children's Museum of Houston is free after 5 p.m., The Health Museum is free from 2-7, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston is free all day (courtesy of Shell) .Houston's Museum District is walkable and bikeable. Sidewalks are wide and well-maintained, and attractions and restaurants are situated near each other.The district is bordered roughly by Texas State Highway 288, Hermann Park, U.S. Route 59, and the Texas Medical Center. The Museum District Civic Association compared the area to Georgetown in Washington, D.C. and to the French Quarter of New Orleans.The Museum District is served by four stops on the METRORail, one specifically named for it and is easily accessible from I-69/US 59, State Highway 288 and Main Street, across from the main entrance to Rice University.\nThe beginnings of the Museum District are found in 1977, when it became apparent that some action needed to be taken to provide easier access to the museums of the area. This call for community improvement evolved into the non-profit Montrose Project by the mid-1980s but changed into the Museum District Development Association of Houston (MDDAH) shortly thereafter.  Based on the works of this organization, the Museum District was formally recognized by the City of Houston in 1989. The founding organization was dissolved in 1994, but the Museum District is now under the auspices of the Houston Museum District Association, founded in 1997.\nThe Museum District attracts visitors, students and volunteers of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities to learn about and celebrate art, history, culture, and nature around the world.  More information on the 20 institutions of Houston's Museum District may be found on their official website.The Third Ward Redevelopment Council defines the Museum District as being part of the Third Ward. T. R. Witcher of the Houston Press wrote in 1995 that the district and nearby areas are \"not the first places that come to mind when you say \"Third Ward,\"[...]\".\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the late 1970s, the area currently including the Houston Museum District had fallen into disrepair, badly needing attention from local, county and state governments to improve roads and beautify the area, then unsafe for pedestrian traffic and cyclists.\nThe Houston Museum District began as a grassroots community movement in 1977 led by Alexandra R. Marshall whose concept was to create a pedestrian-friendly district with the Museum of Fine Arts, at the intersection of Bissonnet Street and Montrose Boulevard, as its core.    In such a strongly vehicle-oriented city, and one which to this day retains the title of the largest city in the United States without zoning, this was fairly progressive.\nThe Museum District Development Association of Houston proposed a multi-phase plan to beautify and make more pedestrian-friendly the area located between Allen Parkway, Buffalo Bayou and Hermann Park. It took advantage of the opportunity to create in Houston an area of vital urban importance, similar to the French Quarter in New Orleans, St. Germain in Paris, and Georgetown in Washington, DC.\nSince its creation, the numerous efforts of the Houston Museum District organizations have included community improvement projects, tree planting, sidewalk planning, construction and expansion, esplanade design, development and beautification, establishment of public transportation to and from the area, police support and various cultural events\nThe Montrose Association, the Museum Area Municipal Association, the South Main Civic Association, the Cultural Arts Center of Houston and TALA (Texas Accountants and Lawyers for the Arts) all played a part in the development and subsequent success in the creation of the Houston Museum District.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n1977: Concept formulated, area associations involved.\nJanuary 1986: Montrose Project incorporated.\nJuly 1986: Montrose Project becomes the Museum District Development Association of Houston.\nMarch 1987: MDDAH gains  501(c)3 status.\nMay 1988: \u201cRaiders of the Lost Art\u201d event held to raise funds and awareness of the District.\nSeptember 1989: The Museum District receives a Clean Houston Honorable Mention in the Proud Partners Awards for its Museum District Improvement program.\nSeptember 1989:  Business leaders, museum directors and members gathered to sign a coalition agreement supporting a City of Houston Resolution creating an official Museum District.\nOctober 18, 1989: The area along Montrose Boulevard, from Allen Parkway to Hermann Park was designated by the City of Houston City Council and Mayor Kathryn Whitmire as the official Museum District of Houston.\n1990: The Cultural Arts Council of Houston, now known as Houston Arts Alliance published The Cultural Guide to Houston, a guide book of Houston which included maps of each cultural center in the city, including a map of the Museum District.\nDecember 1991: MDDAH helped host the 5th Annual Christmas and Hanukkah in Neartown, with a tree lighting, caroling and a Children\u2019s Parade and Festival.\nMay 1992: \u201cSavor the Flavors\u201d benefit held for the Museum District, highlighting 23 local restaurants.\n1994: The organized abandonment/dissolution of the 501(c)3 Museum District Development Association of Houston. Records were handed off to the South Main Center Association for further collaboration and development within the community.\nNovember 1996: Shepherded by the South Main Center Association, now South Main Alliance, the organizations of the Museum District joined together to publish a brochure, promoting the Museum District, which included new member museums.\nJanuary 1997: Eleven institutions reincorporated the Houston Museum District Association as a 501(c)3 corporation.  Five new museums joined in 2002 and two more in 2007.\n\n\n=== Founding members ===\nAccording to 1st board meeting notes (Oct 4, 1986):Directors:\n\nAlexandra Marshall, Chairman\nOra Harrison, President\nLyn Mathre\nJan Chism\nJohn B.

Later, with growing awareness of the MDDAH and their work, funding came from numerous other sources.\nToday, total operating budgets for the member museums exceed $80 million, funded almost completely from revenues and private donations. Museum District funding includes approximately $1.5 million in Hotel Occupancy Tax funds from the City of Houston and the Houston Arts Alliance; contributions from all participating museums; foundation support from The Houston Endowment, Inc.; The John P. McGovern Foundation; The Wortham Foundation, Inc.; The Brown Foundation, Inc.;  Susan Vaughan Foundation, Inc.; and corporate support from  KHOU-TV Channel 11, KUHT-TV (PBS), the Houston Chronicle, Texas Monthly, Exxon, and Cadillac.\n\n\n== Public issues ==\nThe District plays an ongoing role in forming responses to public concerns and opportunities that include transportation improvements, signage, visitor information, area beautification, flood control and urban planning considerations.\nThe HMDA also serves as an intermediary, which fosters an ongoing dialogue among the museums in the district to maintain continuing interest and visitation in the area.\n\n\n== Leadership ==\nLaurette Canizares, Executive Director, Houston Museum District Association Gina Miller, Programming and Public Relations Manager, Houston Museum District Association \n\n\n== Residential areas ==\nMuseum Park Neighborhood Association (MPNA) serves houses roughly bound by Texas State Highway 288, Hermann Park, Main Street, and Alabama Street. Several apartment and/or condo communities are already in the area and new ones are currently being built and developed. One benefit of living at The Circle at Hermann Park, The Mosaic, The Parklane, The Plaza, The Warwick, or new residential communities being built is that residents enjoy easy walking distance to the Houston Zoo, The Children's Museum of Houston, The Houston Museum of Natural Science, Miller Outdoor Theater, Hermann Park, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and more.\nIn 2003 Keiji Asakura of SLA Studio Land presented the Museum District Walk Project, a project to expand walkability in the area. In 2015 a walkability study came from SWA Group.By 2018 residential condominiums became a popular form of residence in the community.\n\n\n== Parking ==\nParking in the Houston Museum District can be tricky if you visit on Thursdays, weekends, HISD Spring/Summer/Winter vacation days, or evenings when Miller Outdoor Theater is hosting a popular show. A parking lot adjacent to the McGovern Centennial Gardens on Hermann Drive was added in 2014. You may park there for free. Parking in the lot across from the Law Building at MFAH is also free. You may also park at the zoo or in the lot near the Rice University Light Rail Station for free (there is a 3-hour time limit). You may pay to park along Hermann Drive or on side streets, in the HMNS garage, or in various garages. You may also park along the MetroRail Line and take the light rail train to Rice University or The Museum District stops.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThe Houston Independent School District (HISD) operates area public schools.\nElementary schools serving portions of the Museum District area:\n\nMacGregor\nPoeMiddle schools serving portions of the Museum District area:\n\nCullen (east of Fannin Street and Montrose Boulevard)\nLanier (west of Fannin Street and Montrose Boulevard)Beginning in 2018 Baylor College of Medicine Academy at Ryan also serves as a boundary option for students zoned to Blackshear, Lockhart, and MacGregor elementary schools.Lamar High School serves houses in the Museum District area.Presbyterian School is located in the Museum District. The Post Oak High School, a private Montessori high school, opened in the northern hemisphere fall of 2012. It is the first high school in the Museum District.In 2013 Houston A+ Challenge announced that the private middle school A+ Unlimited Potential would open in the Museum District area.\n\n\n=== Public libraries ===\n\nThe Houston Public Library Clayton Library, Center for Genealogical Research is located in the Museum District. The genealogical collection, originally housed in the Julia Ideson Building in Downtown Houston, moved to the William Clayton Home, a Georgian-style house built in 1917, in the Museum District in 1968. A site for a new building, adjacent to the Clayton Home, was purchased in 1986. The new building, which was built in 1988, was designed to complement the Clayton Home. The city implemented a $6.8 million renovation project for the Clayton Home and the guest house and carriage house on the property in the 2000s. The city planned to renovate the property so it would meet LEED standards. The city installed an elevator in the guest house so the building could be used as an administrative office. The carriage house received an addition so it could function as a 100-person conference room. The Clayton site can accommodate one plenary session and four breakout meetings, which would be required for a national genealogical conference. The Houston Business Journal awarded the renovation as the best historic renovation for its 2009 Landmark Awards. There is also a branch of the Houston Public Library in the Children's Museum of Houston.\n\n\n== Religion ==\nFirst Presbyterian Church is located in the Museum District.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMelissa Chiu\nHouston Alternative Art\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMuseum District Walk & Roll Audio Tour",

          "Great experience at The Health Museum on Saturday! I attended with a group and we started in the DeBakey Cell Laboratory. We broke into small groups of 2-3 people and did real experiments like separating actual DNA strands from cells, identifying red and white blood cells from",
          "There are 11 organ systems in the human body and this museum barely even brushes over any of them... and half of the stuff in there doesn't even work. There really is so much lost potential here. I know museums aren't a huge business, but this museum really could use a complete",
          "The museum has the potential to be a top attraction in the area but it just is not there yet. The positives were that it had a really good gift shop with a lot of good books and things to buy. The brain teasers were also fun to play with and try to figure out. Some of the",
          "The Health Museum is in a total state of disrepair. Most of the exhibits are broken and non-functional; several other exhibits are just run down and dirty. It really isn\u2019t worth a stop. Go to the brightly lit and well run nearby Children\u2019s Museum instead.",
          "As one who has worked in the Biomedical Sciences, I found the museum to be mediocre - especially since a number of the exhibits did not function. There were parts missing and directions were not easy to read. A nice concept, but lacking in management.",
          "Went with three other family members since it was free Thursday and we were looking for something to do. There were a lot of good exhibits although as another reviewer noted, many were broken. It would have been much better if they worked. This is a good place to take kids to",

          "My husband, 19 yr old daughter and I went to this museum as it was on our \"to do list\". They have on-site parking that is $3 for members and $5 for non-members. We paid our $10 each admission and proceeded to the first and newest exhibit on Biorhythm, how music moves you.....It",

          "Great interactive museum with focus on health and science. Create mechanical devices, learn about prosthetics, see how technology has helped those that have physical challenges and limitations. Could be bigger.",
          "i brought my 11, 13 and 16 yr olds. While some of the exhibits are geared toward younger children, there was plenty to interest my kids. The Debakey Cell Lab was a fun upgrade @ $5 per person to chose and complete any three of the (6?) activites, totally worth it. LOVED being",
          "I went here with my mother and sister (who is currently in nursing school). We had a good, enjoyable time. The brain teasers are definitely one of the highlights of the museum. It's not a very large museum, but all of the hands-on activities make it worth the $10 admission price.",

          "16 year old interested in science dragged me here ....and we had a wonderful day! We spent most of our time at the Debakey Cell Lab doing science experiments together, we even managed to extract DNA in one of the experiments! Very interesting hands on experience for all age",
          "This is one of the best Museums in Houston. The adults probably loved it more than the children. Lots of interactive things to do. The exhibits are always awesome.",
          "Ok, this is not your normal museum, but for us it was fantastic. Health related information about the human body. What is wrong with learning about this. I say take your kids here, no matter what age they are. And pay the extra $5 per person to do hands-on lab",
          "Took my boys 6 & 8 here and they had a blast! Lots of interactive models and a great day! I would suggest it to anyone with kids!",
          "Brought my 5 and 8 year old granddaughters here on a recent trip to Houston. It's a small museum but has lots of fun, unique exhibits. We spent about 2 hours wandering around and the girls really enjoyed it. There were several medical students from the nearby university there",
          "I remember taking my grandchildren here long ago and they got to watch someone cut open a Cow heart and dissect it! So much FUN!!!",
          "I took my 6 year old twins, 5 year old and 2 year old to the health museum and all ages had fun! It's small but a fun way to spend an hour while in Houston!",
          "We enjoyed this museum (kids ages 11, 10, 8, 6). The Body Works exhibit was amazing!!! We did, however, end up at the museum at the same time as several school groups, so it was very crowded.",
          "The Health Museum is a very nice location if you are taking your children to experience a few interactive exhibits while exploring different aspects of the human body. BUT if you are looking for a location to take a large group of students, this is not the location.",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect but found the exhibits fascinating, easy to understand and so educational. Having been thru some medical experiences, I could easily relate to some of the exhibits. What struck me was hoe many people were so absorbed in taking time to study each",
          "Dang. You gotta go here! You will see actual plasticine cutaways of the human body and learn how it works. You get to do a whole lot of interactive things. Pay extra if you have to, or take a group or whatever, but get into the DeBakey Cell Lab. Totally cool. Went on an adult",
          "The museum is interesting for all ages. The body works portion is excellent and all of us (adults) learned quite a bit. On weekdays there will be school groups which tends to be crowded, but not really an issue. Price is reasonable. Suggest parking free just kitty corner to",
          "They have 1 cashier taking your payment. Line out the door. Museum was ok for the Body Worlds exhibit. Spent couple of hours here on a Saturday. Parking lot in front of museum press button for ticket to park. Take receipt to long line to pay for parking when you purchase",
          "This museum is quite educational and state of the art with regard to the human anatomy and the effects of illness and smoking upon one\u2019s body. There is a wonderful movie on the making of the cadavers used in the museums displays. The staff is extremely informative and willingly",
          "Went to the museum to see the Body Works Exhibit and loved it. The admission is affordable at $10 for adults. The exhibit was split into 2 parts. The location is great it's right across the street from Hermann park and The Children's Museum (which is also pretty cool). The",

          "Our grandsons aged 6 and 8 were desperate to go and we're had a great time. Inexpensive as far as museums go and we paid the extra $5 each to do three science experiments which are boys could do. Definitely recommend this.",
          "I guess I was expecting a bit more of an adult experence and what I found was something pretty basic with a good many hands on exhibits.",
          "Younger kids will love this place and adults will learn too but really geared well for children. Nice to pair this with a trip to the zoo.",
          "This is a really wonderful museum with a lot of state of the art exhibits. The beating heart is very cool. Lots of easy to follow, interactive and educational exhibits. The gift shop also has lots of unique items!",

          "What fun. Especially for kids and adults who don't know much about science. It has only one floor but most is interactive. Exhibits include the five senses, how the brain works, a simulated heart attack, mind teaser puzzles and, best of all, the Debakey Cell Lab. For $3",
          "Many of the areas of interest relied on outdated tech, touch screen tech or photo technology that is readily available on an app. The other areas were either too simple to be interesting or boring. When compared with the awe inspiring content of the museum of science this is",

          "At first we thought what's a 'Health Museum'. Turns out it's fun. Very interactive, nice exhibits for the kids and good learning opportunities. It's small so you don't need a ton of time to visit. Plan it as a part of another outing in the Museum district or as a stand",
          "I really didn't think I would like it so much. I played brain games and got to learn about the human body in new and creative ways. Great for kids, awesome for adults!",
          "The first time I visited I was six and could remember being overwhelmed by how awesome all the exhibits were. Coming back with my younger sister and after the museum being revamped for better quality, I was disappointed. Maybe it was being older and more cynical, or maybe the",
          "Our entire family went and we had so much fun. Not only did we all have fun we all learned so much! I also left my iPad in the screaming booth. My iPad was turned in to the information center. How wonderful is that! Everyone is super nice here!",
          "I visited The Health Museum with a group of seniors and we all agreed we learned a lot and made discoveries! The drawback was the large group of young campers on a field trip....and the mixture of generations proved to be interesting! The 12 foot tall beating heart, 10 foot",
          "Many of the exhibits were simply not working. The person at the front desk said there was some renovating going on (no evidence of same in the bldg) and said she would try to get someone \"from upstairs\" to come down to explain the problems. I just wanted to have the exhibits",

          "We had never been to The Health Museum before, and we live in Houston. So, for only $45, I signed us up for membership, as gosh, that is nothing and it support our community. We went to see the exhibit on \"hunger\" which consisted of black and white photos of person that had",
          "I enjoyed my visit with my elementary aged children today. The 4d movie was great and the lab was very interesting. I felt like my kids learned a lot with all the hands on activities. With that being said, I was surprised with how small the museum is. We were there for 2",
          "The Health Museum is a great concept and a wonderful strategy to de-mistify the human body, health and disease. There are few health or medical museums around the world and this one is clearly among the top 3. If helps to have the Texas Medical Center in its neighborhood, being",

          "Well done hands on museum. Crawl through colon, walk through brain and under spine. Ears and eyes, everything explained on a child's level. Plenty of hands on do it yourself displays. 4D movie was very well done and kept kids attention while educating. Parking extra $1.00 ?",
          "There is always interesting special exhibits along with the great regular exhibits. The health center is a lot of fun.",
          "This museum is unfortunate enough to be in an area with a number of other museums that are larger and more well-known, but if you've got a few hours to spare, it's worth it. We learned about it because it is part of our home science museum's reciprocity list so we got in for",

          "After visiting the Holocaust Museum I took the short walk to the Health Museum. The Health Museum is located next to the Children's Museum of Houston. It cost $9 for an adult ticket. This museum is suitable for children and teenagers very interactive. There is also a short 4d",
          "A good place for school's to go or families with children between the ages of 7-12. I think adults would like a few of the exhibits but most are certainly aimed toward kids. This probably helps them bring in school groups which probably bring in more money. Exhibits can",

          "The human body exhibits were really fun, as was the 3D movie experience. The food and nutrition side of the house was a bit of a snore, and it's too bad that the lab section isn't included in the price of admission. All in all, it's not a bad little place, but it needs more",
          "I bought the Groupon membership because I have a very bright nearly-four year old who loves watching medical training films and going to science labs, so I thought she would enjoy this. \"I want to see the intestines!\" was all I heard about the whole drive there. Unfortunately",
          "This museum is one of the few that focus so well on the biological sciences, especially the human body. While this is laudable, several exhibits were not functional, appeared worn, and lacked the feel of a well maintained facility. I suggest a fresh makeover.",
          "The museum is great for young kids - found it a little basic for adults. My children had a great time and loved that there was a mad science show during our visit. Definitely worth at least one visit.",
          "We've bought a membership through Groupon twice- and both times it paid for itself in the first visit. They have added a DNA science lab for kids and the kids (ages7-14) didn't want to leave this area. Lots of fun experiments for different age groups. The 4D movie is always",
          "It was raining and I was looking for a place to take the kids indoors. They played with huge checker games and the play house and grocery area. Other than that I would say dont bring small kids.",
          "My children in my life love this place. It is extremely educational and fun and includes many different ways to teach children about the health and science of the human body. This is a great indoor activity to do with your children during the heat of Houston's summers.",
          "Ostensibly a 'children's museum' my teenage son and I enjoyed our visit. Interesting activities for all esp the brain teaser puzzles!",
          "It definitely not the most sophisticated museum. Being from a science background I didn't learn anything new but had some childish fun with my girlfriend. The museum is small and most of the exhibits are interactive. We also spent 3 more dollars so we could go to the cell lab",
          "We weren't sure what to expect from this museum, and we were pleasantly surprised. Good exhibitions for kids, teenagers and adults alike. We added $3 each for the Lab, which our 'scientific' 15 yrs old enjoyed very much. One get to perform real experiments and lab procedures.",
          "There are some good parts of this museum that are worth noting. It does provide some interesting information about the human body, especially the 3D \"movie\" shown in the theater. I was also surprised to see some exhibits that have to do with mental health (the one about sharing",
          "We expected a serious museum but there was nothing which we found interesting. It basically explains the human body on a low level. The way it is conveyed is for kids. But probably even kids will not like it because the computer technology is totally outdated and often not even",
          "Although this is not advertised as a museum for children it is in fact directed at non scientific general public as well as children which surprised us but in the end we found it such fun that we spent quite a few hours playing with the various exhibits. We had accidently chosen",
          "I was sort of disappointed in this one. It really should be part of the adjacent Children's Museum. Most of the exhibits are geared toward middle school kids at best. Not much of interest for adults.",
          "Lived in Houston most of my life but only just took my 8 year old to the Health Museum! What a surprise! We thoroughly enjoyed our time and the exhibits. A definite must visit if you've done the Children's museum, and/or The Zoo and still have a few hours or a rainy day to",
          "This is a great space but think the target audience for children is 8 or so. There is an age limit to dress up as scientists in the \"lab\" the open play space requires reading skills to understand the prompts-- the permanent exhibit relies a lot on reading also. But the giant",
          "This is a small museum that holds so much inside for everyone to enjoy! Came in with teenagers (that are not usually so thrilled about museums) and they loved it. One of the newest atractions in the museum is a hand-on lab. You get a white coat ans spectacles and an assignment-",
          "I went to the health museum and discovered how nice it was to actually get to see everything in the place without becoming exhausted. Lots of interactive stuff for the kids, and a few nice photo opps... it's hard to compete with the natural science museum or the children's",
          "I took 2 children (7 & 4) here--it was more reasonable and MUCH less crowded than the children's museum next door. Lots of hands-on activities. No crowds. Easily passed nearly 3 hours there and enjoyed it very much. Would definitely recommend for others looking for a fun way to",
          "We took our pre-teens to the museum on a Saturday and expected big crowds but were surprised. We were able to see everything that we wanted to see at the museum. There was a birthday on but they had their own room. We were able to visit the human self and learned a lot about",
          "I'm the proud aunt of a 9 year old budding scientist, and this museum thrilled her to the core. I took my niece for a late birthday and my fianc\u00e9 for an early birthday treat. Both of them share a live of science that goes far beyond my understanding, but it is an area they",
          "We went 7/7/15 with our two grandchildren. When we arrived we found out the museum was closing at 4 pm due to some event. The presentation in the theatre was a dissection and not the 4D movie about the skin. Then the movie presentation stopped at 3 PM since they were closing",
          "Many, many wonderful interactive exhibits that teach about the functions of various body parts and systems. My kids' favorite was the mind-ball game.",
          "I was glad to pass by the Health museum, every thing is illustrated and explained in an interesting way. It is mainly kids hangout but interested grown ups may find it nice too. One hour is fair enough but if you plan to attend the IMAX show then it would the visit would take",
          "We arrived at the museum about 1pm. It was a Friday and there were very few people in the museum. My wife and I took our preteen and our teenager. The first stop was their lab area. As a group, we extracted DNA from wheat germ, prepared a bacteria slide to look at under a",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect with this museum but since it was on the City Pass we decided to check it out. Very glad we did. It was a blast and had lots of cool, educational exhibits. We got to do some lab work, see a cool movie about germs that hang out on our skin and there",
          "The concept of a museum including all the organs, the idea to walk through a big body is very nice. Unfortunately this museum is just outdated. Every kid can get more information using Daddy's iPad! They should update the whole concept, using technology from today.",
          "This is a really nice museum to visit I'd you are looking for a solid museum experience and not a venue of running, out of control kids. Although there are kids always there, they are on the more behaved end of the spectrum. There are some cool interactive displays there. You",
          "OK, so the only reason I went to this place is because it is free 2-5PM on Thursdays. However, I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it! They have some great touchy-feely (interactive) exhibits. I learned a lot about breast cancer, the ear, the eye, and other things",
          "We had free passes to go to the Health museum. It was not crowded. Lots of hands-on activities. My husband and I did several. I think this would be great for elementary students/with families. There was free parking across the street. Then we went to Hermannpark for picnic.",
          "Good size museum with lot of information about different parts of our body and how they work. You will also find information about different medical technologies used today to diagnose problems such as MRI, CT Scan, X-ray, etc. Very informative for children as well as adults.",
          "My husband, daughter and I recently visited this museum. Our daughter lives near Houston and has been wanting to get to this museum It is VERY out of date, all of the exhibits look like something out of the 70's or 80's and some are not even functional. A big disappointment",
          "I took my son on a friday and there was no one besides us there. The entree fee was a bit high for how small the museum actually is. My son has special needs but he seemed to really like all the exhibits. we saw a special bloodsuckers exhibit and saw a vampire bat and leeches in",
          "Great explanation of the human body, it is very interesting for kids and adults, very good designed to be interesting and you never bores, with 1 to 2 hours you will finish with lots more knowledge.",
          "This small museum was a bit of a disappointment. It featured a lot of older interactive exhibits, many of which didn\u2019t work. The exhibit hall called the Amazing Body Pavilion featured a 20-plus-foot backbone with ribs descending from ceiling to floor, which gave the feeling of",
          "It's for kids. Let's get that out of the way. The wife and I were looking for something different to do one afternoon and decided to hit this place up. Their website doesn't really do a great job of emphasizing the overall goal of the museum. We arrived to find that it was",
          "Group of 20 senior adults attended free hours (Thursdays 2:00pm to 5:00pm). Key items viewed were the 3D film about Planet You or the organisms living on our skin and body display. Movie was disappointing since it had more focus on young man pursuing young woman for 10 or 15",
          "We went for the Teddy Bear Health Clinic. While there, we toured all of the displays and as always learned lots of great health facts. Because we had such a good experience and have another little one that is just the right age to enjoy it, we renewed our family membership.",
          "Our kids (7 and 9) loved the Health Museum. The museum is mostly interactive so the kids are constantly busy with fun things to do. Every once in a while there might be a demonstration. My kids got to see a pair of pig lungs and learn how they work. We adults and the kids",
          "The museum is small and most of the interactive exhibits were broken. The Houston area has many other attractions that are much more enjoyable. This museum at the least should offer a reduced price or free admission until the exhibits are repaired. I do not recommend this as an",
          "We spent $40 for tickets and parking. I am a nurse and was excited to go. It was bad. Over 1/2 the exhibits were broken. The interactive exhibits were dirty and it took about 40 minutes to go through the whole thing. We went to the 4G movie which was 18 minutes of the trip.",
          "While this museum is not huge (in comparison to the Children's Museum for example), it is packed full of interesting, engaging and informative exhibits. Our children (ages 6 & 10) were overwhelmed with info within about 2 hours. Shorter, frequent visits will be good. I like that",
          "We were looking for things to do and found this museum on Free things to do in Houston....Thursdays are free to get in so we thought \"why not?\". It was very interesting, very interactive and entertaining while learning. It is more for kids, but we enjoyed it as well. I sat",
          "We recently toured the Health Museum with two young pre K boys and we thought it was outstanding! It is so well put together and the displays were informative and fun and there were interactive carts with additional activities too. We can't wait to go back!",
          "The museum was good for learning purposes but for people like us that was vacationing it became frustrating to try and look around with three busses of elementary students. I would not suggest anyone to visit while they have field trips going on. The museums should have",
          "My 9 year old son, my husband, and I went to this museum, and we really enjoyed it! The information is interesting, and a lot of the exhibits are hands on. We really enjoyed the 4D movie the most. I'd say go here instead of the Children's Museum.",
          "Our children are ages 2, 12, 13, 14, & 14. They all had a pretty good time, but I felt like the museum could be updated and much more advanced. I am a nurse, so my expectations may be too high. The 4D show was cheesy, but I think an elementary aged child would enjoy it. One",
          "We took our 3.5 and 5 yr olds, and I'd say they enjoyed 40% of the exhibits. The Insects, Eat Well Play Well, and a handful of the Amazing Body exhibits (large mouth, skeleton on bike, etc) were favorites. There's alot of hands-on educational things to try, but I think 6 yrs and",
          "My Mom, a retired nurse, suggested we visit this Museum. We visited Thursday 2 - 5 to get free admission. Four year old son had a great time walking around checking out all the attractions, puzzles, interactive learning items. All were entertained and educated by the",

          "When we first arrived at the Health Museum it seemed small with little to offer. We were wrong. You do need to engage with the museum verus be entertained. They have a lot of fun interactive things for kids to learn about the body. So take your time - hope it isn't busy,",
          "This museum has some very interesting hands on activities. But not enough. And the ones they have look worn. There was too much reading, which would bore smaller children. However, there are plenty of great photo ops. I didn't see a food option. But there may be one. We",

          "This museum is amazing and interactive, you really get to know more about the body and it will be amazing for schools and teachers to be here and expose the students to know more about health science and help them protect and learn more \u2026",
          "This is a great way to educate yourself and your kids about health.",
          "Really cool and interactive, but very small. An hour at most is probably enough there.",
          "It was ok a few years back. We went with friends who were bored and ready to leave after 30 minutes. The exhibits my husband and I are interested in are being featured now at Health Museum. We had hoped to visit on my birthday last Friday \u2026",
          "It was amazing! Very interactive!!",
          "Recommended. Nice view of man's insides.",
          "This is an awesome place, staff is very friendly and its free 2pm to 7pm Thursdays",
          "It was a lot more fun than I expected! Love the brain teasers and the experiments that can be done in the lab!",
          "Good time for spec. Exercises & stuff",
          "Informative and interactive museum. People can interact with models that make learning fun. The biorhythm exhibit is very fun, I recommend it. There's also a lab, in which you get to do different experiments. One thing I would improve though is the fact that there are too little exhibits. Very fun though!",
          "It has changed  a lot since I was a kid, very interactive and  informative +",
          "The Lone Star Chapter of The Hemophilia Foundation was awesome!! Wonderful & Elegant 80's night!! The staff & museum is fabulous!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude03",
          "Lots of fun, interactive exhibits, labs, and puzzles! I would love to come back again. \n\nTry and come on Thursdays because entry is free!",
          "It's cool. Kind of small and a little grubby- like Chucky Cheese without the pizza. Ok to stop in while killing time. We may go back for the lab experience.",
          "That was so much fun!!! So interactive and informative!!!",
          "Definitely geared towards families with young children. Admission was free when we visited, which was nice because we didn't stay there for very long. There were some interactions that adults could participate in as well. Informative about \u2026",
          "Good for a walk through, staff was nice and the place was very clean.",
          "Nice small museum. We saw a heart dissection that included interactive discussion with children.",
          "Small but educational. You can finish the entire museum in under three hours. We did enjoy ourselves.",
          "A great place for everyone to learn and have fun.",
          "It was so much fun! Even though that we went on a day that it is free, there was no wait. Tons of interactive things to do. The kids enjoyed it.",
          "Idk of it\u2019s just me... but I used to think this museum was amazing when I went for my 5th grade field trip a looooong time ago... but I visited recently as an adult and was very underwhelmed. Nothing much has changed and the museum itself \u2026",
          "Great for children!! Early science!!",
          "Beneficial & a great time.",
          "So fun \ud83d\ude0a!",
          "Went here for a raining and thought it was really awesome.",
          "My kids loved this place. Has plenty of interactive attractions and a lot of pieces of information!",
          "I love museums, but this museum is absolutely my favorite!  I am very much into health and fitness so this museum is perfect for me.  The exhibits are interactive.  The cell lab is a lot of fun and gives you the chance to get hands-on \u2026",
          "The disease exhibit was amazing.",
          "Great gift shop.  Exhibits are improving.",
          "My son's first time here and he had a great time",
          "A lot of fun for the kids.",
          "Fun and affordable. Thursfays are free 3-7 very small Museum than I expected",
          "Do the lab experiments! Be a scientist for a day!",
          "What an AMAZING PLACE!!! There are so many anazing things to do here and they are truly running some world class programs at the Houston Health Museum!",
          "Great science for the hold family",
          "Great place for kids & adults alike. Interesting stuff to read, see, & learn. Thursday\u2019s are free entry 2-7pm!",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Museum! The staff was very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Body as a Work of Art was amazing!",
          "The best part is the active Science Biology Lab here where the kids were able to do live experiments. Well maintained and friendly staff",
          "Awesome place for kids my daughter really enjoyed it wish we had planned to stay for the day",
          "I loved it because I was there for robotics and also the service.but my main part is the jumping.it depends on height",
          "The Health Museum has exhibits that can either feel dated or fresh and new. The DeBakey Cell Lab for instance is a relatively new addition for older kids (7+, just be aware if you bring little ones). We spent an hour or so looking at all of \u2026",
          "Super fun to go to for both kids and adults. Their free day was not as long as the other museums so my friend and I had to pay to go in but it was only $10. It has some pretty cool exhibits as well as some fun games/activities for younger \u2026",
          "Great place for family",
          "This museum is so underrated. It is a great place to take kids. The interactive exhibits spark fantastic conversations about health and the human body. It is educational while still recognizing children learn through play. I would love to see them expand.",
          "Lots to learn and fun activities for the whole family",
          "Great idea to have some fun with the kiddos!",
          "Somewhat small, but, worth a quick visit. Where else can you crawl through a giant diseased butt-hole? Wait, don't answer that.",
          "I had a blast especially in the lab where I learned how to stitch :)",
          "Very educational and fun Interactive exhibits also if you are part of a school which I am you could do special trips we did a sheep heart dissection very fun",
          "Great little museum. However, not that much to explore. Your ticket only grants you to an informative movie but everything else is for an additional ticket. Loved the beating heart demo!",
          "The displays are intriguing but my five star goes especially for the staff who answered every question my granddaughter asked and more.  The staff is so knowledge and concerned from the entrance to the gift shop to the exhibits to the exit \u2026",
          "Brain teasers are the best in town!",
          "Very educational. Check it out and learn something new.",
          "Interactive and kid friendly",
          "Nothing bad to say, just not a 5 star museum.",
          "Amazing! Most of the museum was heavily intended for children, but it is very enjoyable. I highly recommend doing the cell lab. It made for a great date with my boyfriend.",
          "Great place for a field trip!",
          "Smaller than expected but good nonetheless",
          "THIS WAS THE GREATEST MUSEUM EVER",
          "I called to chat with Bob in finance and he rudely hung up on me for no reason ???",
          "Very informative and fun! The colossal colon was one of my favorite parts! There is a colossal heart that goes on cardiac arrest every 45 to 30 minutes and it's very interesting. I had fun testing how long I can hold my weight and also \u2026",
          "First time going there ever. It was cute. Apparently I have dark inner energies according to that one positive negative exhibit I participated in. I'm not surprised. \ud83d\ude12",
          "Fun, educational and affordable!!!",
          "We spent sure a bit of time exploring the exhibits. It was a fun way to spend a few hours in the museum district",
          "The children had a fun time.",
          "Very interesting and entertaining. Great get out for the kids especially. And very informative. If you care about your health and your kids health - it's a must visit!",
          "Excellent staff who love working with children and make a learning experience a fun experience. \nAdmission rates are reasonable for the facilities which was clean and we'll organised. Best of all the kids had a wonderful time.",
          "Smaller than we expected and they remove couple of exhibits.",
          "With our ASTC membership card, we try to visit museums while we are visiting different cities. The Health Museum was nearly a dud. I have 2 kids, 5 and 6. We were there for less than an hour. The part with the large body structures is cool. \u2026",
          "It was very interesting. I wish my Professor have the whole class meet here!",
          "Loved the experience. Science is my son's favorite subject and this was a great opportunity for us to geek out together.",
          "We took our two girls ages 4 and 6 for the first time. They LOVED running through the colon and playing wack-a-poop with mom. We saw the Second Skin (I think that was what it was called) exhibit and the girls immediately found bodies that \u2026",
          "The staff were incredibly attentive and helpful during every display helping me one on one.\n The lady behind the counter showed me the museum map and gave me many recommendations \ngraciously & generously giving of her time. \nThe museum \u2026",
          "Real nice place for the young ones to come and learb about the Human body in a safe way, PG13.",
          "Fun to take the kids",
          "Wonderful place, definitely a place to take the family",
          "For $10 it's OK but feels a little poorly done. The smithisonian natural history museum has more regarding health and the body. The exhibitions looked a little dated.",
          "If you go here on a field trip be prepared to be berated by the black director in the Debakey lab.  She was mean and yelled at the kids who simply were trying to follow directions.  The other doctor is also very rude that worked in the lab. \u2026",
          "It is real educational but more for younger kids",
          "Very small place, good info, 1 to 2hrs out of your day.",
          "A beautiful experience about our body.",
          "Cute place for kids and teens",
          "It was a good experience learned a few things.  I'm not sure how much they charge to go in, (we went a Thursday when it was free), but I'm glad we didn't pay. The place is small not to many activities, but still really nice.",
          "We went as a family both grown daughter's a boyfriend and our 2 yr old granddaughter spent 5 hrs and still didn't see or do it all. The exhibits where fascinating and informative and the staff was friendly and very knowledgeable we had a great time. Highly recommend it",
          "Insightful, creative, and fun way of sharing information",
          "They need to put more stuff in the museum smh.",
          "We went to the museum to see the Body Worlds exhibit. It was fantastic! The museum is not huge but it is well done. Great attraction.",
          "They had real human lungs and brain and heart in trays being displayed. It was fascinating!",
          "Cool place",
          "Must take kids.. very educational",
          "Best place for kids fun. We enjoyed it a lot. Worth visiting.",
          "Houston has great museums including the health museum which I think often gets overlooked. Cool exhibits for kids & adults, plus special events and in my experience it's never been too crowded.",
          "It was okay. I liked the interactivity; however, several of the exhibits were not operational. Some exhibits required an additional fee. Also, it would've been nice to find out how to successfully complete the brain teasers. This place has so much potential. With the right changes, it can achieve a 5-star rating.",
          "Three people to walk around for 5 minutes half of the place is closed down still charge you full price even the gift shop was closed down not worth plus $5 more for each person to go in the cell and you have to pay for parking",
          "The Bio-sounds exhibit got a little too 'art-house' for an otherwise family environment.  The puzzles and physical challenges were fun.  Definitely worth spending an afternoon there, but doesn't quite warrant the annual stop like natural science or kids museum.",
          "Fun for children and adults alike!",
          "Wow! amazing. The giant heart display is very stunning and informational. Loved all the brain teasers and puzzles in the working area.",
          "While we enjoyed parts of museum, we found it more suited for younger families. Lots of hands on activities. The movie was very long and more of a documentary then an intro to the museum or a museum exhibit (most left part way through the movie as they had young children.)",
          "I imagine when this was new and everything worked it was a blast for the kids.  It is not however a place for adults, most especially seniors to waste a bus trip and basically all day to visit.  Exhibits need to be fixed, cleaned and updated too.  I am sure the kids are pretty hard on them.",
          "Great place to spend 2 to 3 hours learning about health and the human body. The movie is certainly worth watching. I would visit here again when in Houston.",
          "Took my gf on a random date here while exploring the museum district and we were pleasantly surprised. Please go see the body of suit exhibit",
          "Cool interactive exhibits and a good ticket price for what the museum offers.",
          "Interesting  museum.",
          "A fun outing for the kiddo!!! very interactive!!",
          "It was good a couple of years back . But now they do not have many exhibits compared to pricing.",
          "Good museum. More directed for younger adults. Great information and presentations",
          "It's ok, for being free on Thursdays",
          "A super noisy place filled with super noisy people and super duper noisy kids. Although we know most of the things exhibited there already I would\u2019ve still enjoyed had ppl/kids behaved themselves. So noisy that I got a head ache! The neighbour hood is really nice though.",
          "Ugh, this place needs a huge makeover! It was so disappointing! It's a health museum. The human body is freaking INCREDIBLE! So show people how incredible it is. Showcase all the cool facts. There are so many cool things you could do with \u2026",
          "So informed and the staff was so polite and helpful",
          "Super nice and good for curious kids",
          "It was small. Not worth admission.",
          "Over priced for really nothing to look at. Houston is a medical city.. And you get this.. .",
          "Interesting place. Great models and depictions of human body parts. Geared more for children. Awesome place to take your young kids or grandkids.",
          "It was a private party. Wonderful venue.",
          "Went to the museum for a C.F. function. Honestly I did not even know the museum existed. Amazing images inside and absolutely loved the massive neural network. I can't wait to take my nephews during normal operating hours!",
          "Interesting and fun.  Great for families with kids 8 and over",
          "This was a very fun museum and also very inclusive for young children, although a little on the smaller side it provided many activities and things to do. I would recommend you visit on a Thursday as admission is free.",
          "Way too crowded when I was there. I might have liked it better if it had been quieter and the four year old I was with hadn't gotten bored. I'd reccommend it for slightly older kids.",
          "Space is small and half of exhibits weren't working. For the ticket price they should take better care. Another unpleasant experience was being followed from the parking lot to the inside by a homeless person. He kept following us closely when we were inside and looking at us. Security? None available.",
          "Awesome place to take your kids! It was very educational and my kid really got a kick out of the giant heart going into cardiac arrest. There's also a cool play area in the colon where it shows different types of colon issues such as, \u2026",
          "The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because there was not that much to do. However, it is very informative and great for kids!",
          "It was a nice experience learning more about myself in a fun way",
          "Is a pretty fun place",
          "It's for children but those puzzles were really tricky and fun.",
          "Smaller than I expected, but worth your time and money. Take advantage of the cell lab.",
          "I was really disappointed that they took out a lot of old standing Hands-On exhibits and replaced them.... With a white couch, a video of people talking about themselves and social media, and a chalkboard. Whoever came up with the social \u2026",
          "Very informative and good spot for family function",
          "The kids have a lot of fun but as an adult, I feel a lot of the things are run down and broken. But hey, if the kids are having fun, who am I to judge. Although, lately they\u2019ve had a lot of new science museum guides/educators? They definitely help with having a great experience!",
          "Very interesting museum.. Great learning place",
          "It was ok. Probably more fun for people who work in the medical field.",
          "We went on family free night Thursday. 2-7. It was packes but very manageable. The entire staff is polite && well trained. There's not structure for lines to explore hands on but you'll get your turn. Fun Fun while learning. Only 1 floor is open. . very quick.",
          "Not many exihibit as expected.",
          "I was there in a group for a trip we are all juniors in high school and I think overall everyone enjoyed it the displays were interesting especially because a lot of the stuff we have recently learned and we\u2019re able to see it enlarged. We \u2026",
          "Interesting,  nice place for kids.",
          "Great exhibit and staff.",
          "There were bodies' chest molds, and (we), the audience were encouraged to ask the age, size, gender of each chest mold. Quite interesting.",
          "Wonderful venue with great events, would gladly come back again see the new exhibits",
          "Super nice museum with so many fun exhibits. I definitely recommend going to see the new biorhythm exhibit. It's super cool!",
          "Great place for children to learn.",
          "When my family and I went, half of the activities/displays were out of order. It was expensive, $30 dollars per person, considering most of the biggest attractions did not work at all. There were little brain teaser games on various tables \u2026",
          "A bit hidden, but so happy I discovered this place. Saw Body Worlds here recently, which was fascinating, but was happy to find they also have a number of other cool exhibits. Our group definitely enjoyed the brain teasers, and as a grad \u2026",
          "Good for kids. Small and quick, 1hr.",
          "Totally amazing for the health/ medical nut within me. Kids really enjoyed the interactive options and the Scavenger hunt we participated in; was also a bonus for my son whom was learning about bones and organs at school that week. Great way to reinforce information they should know and hopefully build a love for the Medical sciences.",
          " One of my favorite museums! Good for adults and kids. Very interactive.\nThere is a free family day to go... but it can get crowded.\nMuch more enjoyable on a day when it's less crowded and you can really enjoy all of the exhibits and learn and experience everything without a hundred kids screaming around you.",
          "Great place. Easy parking.",
          "Kids were bored. You get what you pay for. $0",
          "Fun and educational hands-on museum.",
          "We love this museum. Lots of interactive exhibits. Great for kids of all ages. Very educational and fun.",
          "They accommodated my students very well where they had fun.",
          "Very educational, but it needs more interactive activities",
          "This place is very much for children, which I apparently missed in researching prior to going. It's a fairly small place. We spent about 45 minutes there. There were some abstract exhibits, a hands on laboratory, a giant colon that doubles \u2026",
          "Visited the museum as a venue for an event: it was very nice, although having a giant colon and a giant beating heart was not what I was expecting from my spring formal. The acoustics were good though, and the staff was very friendly.",
          "Very nice Museum about Mental and Physical Health\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\nEven though it was thursday and free entrance between 2 PM and 5 PM, there weren't that many people! \n\nDefenitly worth visiting it.",
          "Posted already. Fractured my nosebridge on a homicidal pair of headphones to start the visit.  Half the interactive displays weren't working. You pay for high admission and parking. Only thing interesting were the brain puzzles. I got our money back, you can count on that. Very disappointing.",
          "The Health Museum is located next to the larger Telangana State Archeological Museum in the Public Gardens in Hyderabad. The building is rather impressive externally.\n\nInternally, there are a number of exhibits depicting the importance of \u2026",
          "More for little ones, very nice anatomy models and they have fun games",
          "Not much medical stuff. I expected yo see surgical mysteries, unusual medical discoveries. Very little to see. Mostly for elementary children.",
          "They can make the place more enjoyable",
          "Awesome. The dr. Who runs the lab is super awesome caring attentive and approachable. Its worth the \ud83d\udcb0",
          "Very interesting. I may need to go back a couple of times to soak in all the information.",
          "The information alone is a great reason to love this place. The body is alive and interactive at the same time. Be sure to consult the times before going because they close at 5pm normally. And while there are some free exhibit here, \u2026",
          "There are some very interesting exhibits and things for kids to do but you will get a feeling pretty quickly that the place is a bit too small. Don't expect to spend more than 3 hours without seeing everything. Still it's worth a visit.",
          "Very informative, interactive and free Thursday nights. Great place to bring the family and have a teaching experience that is fun for all.",
          "Fantastic experience! Came with my wife as a date in the free Thursday and we has a great time learning and sharing ideas about the topic of diversity and the Genome Project. Next time we are bringing our daughter. Parking was easy and close. ",
          "This place is awesome. When my son was invited to a birthday party here and I thought it was a strange place to have a party. After seeing how much fun the kids had in the lab, I was impressed. WAY better than just bouncing around in a germ \u2026",
          "Not much to see.  People working there were very friendly.  We did go at end of day and a couple of things closed so that was half if the museum.  It is not enough you pay to go inside but you also pay for their parking.  A turn off.",
          "Not worth it . VERY , VERY SMALL , not much to do . You can cover the entire museum in 15-20 min . The pictures on google make it seem interesting but it\u2019s not . You can have more fun at the park , it was really boring and we tried to like it but nothing made it fun .",
          "Took the grandsons. They really enjoyed the heart!",
          "Me and my son had a great time here. I like that they even dissected a cow eyeball in front of us. Very interesting place",
          "Great museum",
          "Really small. Could be so much better. Still worth a quick visit.",
          "very cool.",
          "Although I was not impressed much. I learned new stuff and refreshed my memory. I did like the mini class with an actual heart.",
          "Was a really fun museum for my kids 14 and 12 but alot of the attractions weren't working. Also not sure why the building is so big and the museum itself was quite small.",
          "Good museum for kids.",
          "I think that this could be a great museum. But 1/3 of the exhibits were broken. It is small but it was well thought out. I loved the brain teasers!",
          "Lots to see and do, when interactive things actually work....will keep kids attention. Nice gift shop. Convenient to Metro Rail and to Hermann Park, the Zoo and the rest of the Museum District.",
          "The museum is a little sparse but over all pretty okay, it\u2019s mostly aimed for children, the gift shop is nice the people are nice.",
          "Interesting for the kids, very small",
          "It was a good place really enjoyed the interactive displays, however it was extremely small just keep that in mind I would set aside an hour to an hour and a half for this place. Again it was very interesting we enjoyed ourselves",
          "Finally visited this unusually educational museum with my daughter's four-year-old and toddler daughters, meeting friends there, and everyone had a wonderful time!",
          "Nice museum, but very small a few things to see",
          "Small but lots to do here. Very fun!",
          "I saw the museum on TV and thought it would be interesting to go there to see all the exhibits.   I was disappointed when quite a few of the exhibits did not work. Some of them were confusing and didn't understand what they were supposed to \u2026",
          "Great place",
          "It wasn't as fun as it sounded. School groups don't watch their students and the heart attack was too easy to miss. Several displays had issues.",
          "Great place for kids. Very interactive. Needs a little bit of TLC and it would get 5 stars",
          "interactive and great for kids. my husband and i went alone and enjoyed it. they have giant sized organs. you can crawl through. for extra fee, you can learn and play in their 'lab' with microscopes etc \n ",
          "Great exhibit, probably a little bit small. You can take the kids there.",
          "A little small. Better for older kids.",
          "It was amazing i got to do alot even watch a movie.I hope to go there again",
          "Went on free Thursday day and had a blast",
          "Very lame! The hamster wheel was probably the only cool thing lol the exhibits were outdated and the staff had no idea what was going on. The place was very small and smelled old.",
          "Its interesting",
          "Really small. Not much to see and do, but everything there is interesting.",
          "Each exhibit is excellent for kids (interactive, simple, entertaining) and adults (informative, educational, complicated ideas). So many fun brain teaser games. Gift shop had a lot of games, books, puzzles, stuff worth buying. A must see. Could use some maintenance on a few exhibits.",

          "Great supplement to other museums but not worth it alone.  Very small.  Very unique and interesting though, and the gift shop gets 5 stars.",
          "Great place, the exhibits were informative and interactive. We even got to conduct 3 different experiments in their cell lab. Spent about 2.5 hrs. Will be back again!",
          "Such a great experience for the whole family. My kids loved the interactive exhibits and the staff was super friendly and helpful.",
          "The exhibit on Biorhythms is interesting. It is more about the science of sound than music. Lots of interactive exhibits with a docent.",
          "Very nice place to educated the children and have fun.  They have fun give-a-ways for the kids.  My children enjoyed themselves.",

          "This was the biggest waste of 30$. Honestly they should just be an extended wing at the museum of natural science.  Its one whole floor and really nothing interesting.  Parents save your 30$ and go somewhere else where you'll get your \u2026",
          "Great experience for children",
          "Very cool place!  They'll often host evening events, which are cool, too!",

          "I can't believe I hadn't come here before with my kids!  This was a great place to learn about the body.  My kids loved it!",
          "Awesome experience especially in the DeBakey Cell Lab. Thanks Dr. Pinckney and Eric.  The reasoning for the 4 rating is because many of the sound/music interactive displays did not work but the cell lab totally made up for it. Also we \u2026",
          "Great place but it is kinda small.",

          "Good",
          "Neat exhibits ranging from health & exercise, to bones, nerves, childbirth, smoker's lung, bacteria, obesity.  The Body World's plasticized figures are awesome.  Good for kids to adults!",
          "I went on a field trip here with my peers and we all enjoyed it. It was very interactive yet educational at the same time!",
          "I was expecting more!! However, I think it will be good for ages 5-10. My 3 years didn't understand much.",
          "Has some main exhibits that haven't changed but two areas have switched exhibits. We've only came twice, and for my two littles (6 and 4) they have fun. They can't do the debakey cell lab yet because it's 7 and above but they do have \u2026",

          "Where you have more learn",
          "As an adult traveling alone I was very bored and the price of admission is not worth it's for the single level facility.",
          "Not for adults\n Very disappointing, even the special biorhythm exhibit was a flop.",
          "Watch dissections on family free Thursday.",

          "Very interesting for chil\ndren and adults place",

          "Very fun. Very informative. Body Works was amazing and my favorite exhibit by far!",
          "Not very exciting, but you can make it a pleasant activity for young ones.",
          "This is a really cool museum for everyone, not just kids. They have a lot of events. I worked a book fair and that was an interesting experience, the book fair itself was good though.",
          "Awesome place",
          "It is a really fun place but if it was bigger I would give it a 5",
          "They try to make this interesting.  A lot of remodels have been done in the past couple years.  There are several broken exhibits that, unfortunately, have been there for years and never replaced or repaired.  It isn't a place that I would \u2026",
          "The sound exhibit was interesting, but it was short.",
          "Definitely a fun experience and well worth the entrance fee",
          "It was very fun. They had interactive games and brain teasers. They also had a vast set of audio tapes on personal accounts and experiences of people with mental illnesses.",
          "It's ok, worth a look with kids for sure. However, it's a little run down. The movie is 20 years old. The special exhibitions raise the level",
          "Family enjoyed but only took about 90 minutes to see everything",
          "I went to the last Body World exhibit a few years ago and I was blown away. There were so many bodies  and to walk through it was a pleasure and amazing. The current show is about 1/10th of the exhibits that were last seen. It is very \u2026",
          "You could learn and see more on YouTube. I feel nauseous for spending 20 bucks for two adults. I'm not sure I would even bring my kids here.",
          "Informative but not exactly fun.",
          "Would be more fun if all exhibits worked",
          "Great place to visit",
          "Great information, small space but big price tag!",
          "We got in for free due to a promotion but I would have been very disappointed if I would have paid. Not enough exhibits for for a city that is known for its health care.",
          "So much fun! Interesting facts, hands on stuff to participate in,  employees were very nice too!",
          "Great for kids older than 8.",
          "Body Rx exhibit was clean and well organized. Lots of fun and staff was friendly!",
          "I had a great experience. It was a bit scarce on certain subjects and some displays were dusty.",
          "Took the grandkids (10-y-o boy, 12-y-o girl & 14-y-o girl) to the Health Museum on Free Thursday. Interesting hands-on exhibits including a trip thru the colon, heart, eyes, skeletal system, a photography exhibit of more than 150 people in \u2026",
          "The favorite museum of my grandchildren!!!",
          "Cute museum, great for kids! The heart attack simulation is particularly interesting.",
          "So much science!!!! \ud83d\udd2c\ud83d\udd2c. Total fun for the family.",
          "The in-house exhibit is great but geared toward younger kids. We went for the Body Worlds RX exhibit which is great for all ages, I just wish it would have been bigger.",
          "This is a fantastic facility devoted to teaching everyone about health, medical science, and ourselves. Their exhibits are fascinating, and access is so easy!",
          "Cool exhibit with plasticised bodies showing how the human body is built up. Definitely worth a visit. ",
          "Fun and informative",
          "HAVEN'T BEEN  They neglected to let a child in that wanted  to learn but they turn him  away.  He wasn't scheduled  to be there. They had empty seats. He could have sat until the other student showed up.  They didn't show up and the other student was told no so 1 child missed out on some public education because of you.  FEEL BETTER. ",
          "Very cool and informative.",
          "It's good for kids, but I'm a medical student, and this was a bit too simple and for kids. I expect it to be the same for other adults too regardless of profession. Again, good for kids, not adults.",
          "It wasnt too expensive but half the things were broken.",
          "Great but small",
          "Highly recommended!  Haven't learned so much in 1 day since college and had so much fun in the process. Thanks! ",
          "We purchased the Groupon for the Museum. It was a complete waste of time and money. More than half of the biorhythm exhibits were broken. The anatomy section was dark and disappointing. We should have visited the HMNS instead.",
          "The interactive exhibits were interesting but over half weren't operational which was disappointing. The place definitely has potential if tweaks are made. My favorite part was the Humanae exhibit and TedTalk.",
          "Small but fun. Great for kids.",
          "It;s either you will like it or not - only for the human body experts and bio geeks",
          "A really cool museum with best, educational displays and attractions.  Bring the whole family.  Beware, the human body is on full display.",
          "Well done, but not that impressed with what we paid to get in. With a one year old and a 16 year old we were just outside the age range where I think the information presented would have been the most interesting. ",
          "Everybody was so nice and welcoming, but I just didn't think it was that interesting - for me it's only for the ones that really into the human body",
          "Not a lot to do. Spent more time in gift shop the. The museum",
          "Awsome please just needs some touch up cleaning",
          "Neat place to take the kids!",
          "I loved it! Very informative! 3 hours went by like nothing.",
          "It's fun and educational for the kids. Adults are better off somewhere else. Thursdays are free but it gets chaotic.",
          "The experience is very fun and educational. It is a little smaller than most museum in Houston though.",
          "I really like this concept, but I wish the facilities were better at accommodating more people",
          "Very nice, very informative however the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it's too small if they did a nice expansion and added more exhibits, it would definitely be a 5 star museum.",
          "I love the interactive exhibits",
          "Best place for kids to learn about health and human body. Really cool place for everyone including adults.",
          "Great Museum for kids, learn how the. Let works with huge props and fun activities.",

          "Cell experiment room was really good",
          "Great for kids, wonderful experience.",
          "too small- we were in and out in an hour. There were schools there visiting so the cell lab was unavailable. Some hands on things for kids but the body  area of the museum was somewhat graphic, redundant and not very engaging for my 11 year \u2026",
          "Fun, cheap and nice for hot or rainy day outside.",
          "Another place to educate yourself and children.  Full of excitement."

It has remained a geographic centerpiece of Downtown Houston since the arrival of the city's founders, John Kirby and Augustus Chapman Allen in 1836.The square was donated to the city in 1854 by Augustus Allen and used as an open air produce market. Very near Allen's Landing, the original port of Houston, the downtown business district grew around the square. Early city landmarks included the briefly used Texas Capitol and White House. In addition, several City Halls rose and fell at Market Square, each destroyed by fire.The historic square is surrounded by 19th century architecture, housing a variety of businesses, entertainment venues, nightclubs and dining establishments. Market Square is located directly between Allen's Landing and the Theater District.It is a central feature of the Main Street/Market Square Historic District, a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== Lauren\u2019s Garden ==\nFormer Houston-area resident, Lauren Catuzzi Grandolas, was killed on board United Airlines Flight 93 during the September 11 attacks.

          "We found this eventually as the signage wasn\u2019t great but were slightly disappointed as it wasn\u2019t too large compared to other cities but then there is less history here but more if a reason to try and preserve it!",
          "I came to this square to see the original houses of Houston but it was not worth it. Sam Houston park does a much better job of presenting them.",
          "It is a must go in Houston. An old market square in well-designed downtown Houston. Tall buildings have good architectural designs.",

          "This is a small neighborhood square that doesn\u2019t really have much to offer. It\u2019s called historic because some of the stores and bars around the square are some of the oldest in Houston. That\u2019s not saying much. This isn\u2019t New Orleans nor does it have the architecture. However,",
          "It was a quiet Saturday morning when we wandered through downtown Houston. Restaurants and bars, many of them, just started opening and it was very nice to see old brick buildings secluded beneath modern glass and steel high rises. The area felt very safe.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The 1940 Air Terminal Museum is a museum located in Houston, Texas, United States, at William P. Hobby Airport. Collections are housed in the original art deco building which served as the first purpose-built terminal for passenger flight in Houston. The museum currently exhibits several collections focusing on Houston's civil aviation history and is operated by the Houston Aeronautical Heritage Society (HAHS), a recognized Texas 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe museum is housed in the Houston Municipal Airport Terminal building, a streamline moderne airport terminal built with Public Works Administration (PWA) funds in 1940. The terminal building is among the few surviving examples of classic art deco airport architecture from the 1940s. The terminal served Houston during the years when air travelers dressed in their best and embarked for destinations aboard roaring prop liners like the Douglas DC-3 and the Lockheed Constellation. Designed by architect Joseph Finger (who also designed Houston's City Hall), the terminal was designed to meet Houston's growing role as a center for air commerce in the late 1930s. The terminal served as the only commercial air terminal for Houston until 1954, and was subsequently used by various tenants until 1978. In that year, Hobby Airport's manager James Delong proposed demolishing the 1940 terminal to free up ramp space, but enthusiasts blocked the demolition. The terminal was then unoccupied for nearly 20 years.\nIn 1988 Stephen Fox of Cite said that the terminal was \"in very shabby condition.\"\n\n\n== Restoration and modern use ==\nThe city of Houston stabilized the exterior of the building, and members of the Houston Aviation Alliance worked to save the terminal. In 1998, the Houston Aeronautical Heritage Society (HAHS), a nonprofit organization, was formed primarily to save the threatened terminal building. HAHS recognized that funding and renovation must be completed in phases, and created a plan to restore the building over time. In late 2003, HAHS's contractors completed the asbestos and lead abatement of the north wing of the terminal. The abatement process stripped the original plaster from the interior walls, leaving the non-loadbearing tile curtain walls of the terminal intact.The North Wing of the Air Terminal was opened to the public in February 2004 as the first phase of the museum. The restored North Wing of the terminal housed the museum's collection and gift shop and served as the museum's base of operations while completing fund raising and restoration of the remainder of the building.\nThe rest of the building completed asbestos abatement in May 2008 and completed atrium and mezzanine reconstruction in February 2009. The full lower floor will be restored to its original condition when funds permit. The museum will spread out and occupy the entire first floor of the terminal building and then begin renovation of the upper floors.\nThe American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics (AIAA) designated the 1940 Air Terminal Museum a Historic Aerospace Site. The 1940 Air Terminal is the AIAA's 35th aerospace site recognized as a rare example of classic Art Deco airport architecture. In February 2010, the Houston Aeronautical Heritage Society was presented with a Good Brick Award for excellence in preservation for the 1940 Air Terminal Museum. Good Brick Awards are given annually from the Greater Houston Preservation Alliance. In 2008 the Houston Press declared the terminal the \"Best Piece of Aviation History\".In 2008, HAHS was granted a license to the oldest hangar on Hobby Airport's grounds, a 1929 Great Silver Fleet Maintenance Hangar. The organization will use this hangar to display larger exhibits from the collection, such as two simulators, and HAHS's aircraft collection, which includes a 1943 Lockheed Lodestar executive businessliner, and an S-58 Sikorsky Helicopter that was outfitted for civilian heavy lifting.\n\n\n== Funding and special events ==\n\nThe 1940 Air Terminal Museum receives funding through grants from many private and public foundations, as well as individual donors. The museum also operates a Members' Program, which allows special access to some functions for members. The museum and its buildings are also available for private functions.\nHAHS currently benefits from several fundraisers:\nWings and Wheels- every third Saturday of the month, the 1940 Air Terminal Museum has static displays of aircraft and cars.\nPops & Props Gala- an annual fundraising dinner and dance.\nWin-A-Plane Raffle- an annual raffle for a beautifully restored vintage plane.\nHobby Fest- the large, annual Wings and Wheels with several special guests, rides, and prizes.\n\n\n== The Houston Aeronautical Heritage Society ==\nThe 1940 Air Terminal Museum is the project of the Houston Aeronautical Heritage Society. The Houston Aeronautical Heritage Society is a Texan non-profit corporation founded to research, promote and preserve the aeronautical heritage of Houston and southeast Texas. The society was founded in 1998 by a group of aviation, architecture and history enthusiasts. The society includes persons from all walks of life, including students and retirees, architects and attorneys, educators and engineers, community leaders and commercial pilots.\nThe Houston Aeronautical Heritage Society is recognized as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization by the Internal Revenue Service. The society is funded through private and public grants, corporate and personal contributions and net proceeds from revenue generating endeavors such as museum memberships and gift shop sales.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in the Texas Gulf Coast\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe 1940 Air Terminal Museum at William P.

          "This was Houston's first terminal. It seems tiny by today's standards, only 3 sections. It is a very Art Deco style and has a cool antique plane outside and interesting memorabilia inside for any flight or history buffs. They have hosted several parties there with a live band",
          "Went back a couple months ago, it was WELL worth the cheap price of entrance. Great spotting area of Hobby Airport, also. They offer tours of the hangar, which you need to ask for. Very nice and sincere staff, you can tell they really love the museum and what they do. Tons of",
          "A great combination of a personal tour guide and a chance to explore on your own. Aviation and airline artifacts plus a tour of several aircraft, a couple of which you can climb up into. 3 older flight simulators are inoperable but interesting nonetheless. Give this one a try!",
          "OK they are slowly restoring the place, but see what is already done to the main hall. Wow, that is indeed back in time. The 50's are back when you enter the main door. Very nice to meet the older guys who take care of you by explaining the history and all what you want to know.",

          "This is a treasure of aviation history. I think it may even be on of Houston's best kept secrets, although they're still in the process of preserving the history of the airport. There is a small fee, but I think it is well worth it. The variety of airline memorabilia is",
          "Great exhibits, displays, and artifacts - but the jewel is the Art Deco building itself. Imagine you are Howard Hughes, fresh off a flight from the coast. Look for the bas-relief figure above on the runway side, which 20th century minds found 'obscene'.",
          "This small but unique air terminal was still under renovation when I went, but it has a lot of memorabilia to check out, nothing in the way of aircraft, mostly history items. The building is unique, art deco, and you can only imagine when your in it what it must have been like",
          "I never knew TX's role in aviation history. So that was interesting. This is a very low key and small museum, though. The building is art deco and I loved that. You can see it all in and hour or less, really. But if you're in the area, then stop by for a visit.",
          "I highly recommend a visit to this museum adjacent to the runway at Hobby Airport. Houston\u2019s original commercial airport is being restored to its former glory. There is great memorabilia throughout the museum. The highlight was the hanger with all sorts of aircraft. They allow",

        "wiki": "Memorial Park, a municipal park in Houston, Texas, is one of the largest urban parks in the United States. Opened 96 years ago in 1924, the park covers approximately 1,466 acres (5.9 km2) inside the 610 Loop, across from the neighborhood of Memorial. Memorial Drive runs through the park, heading east to downtown Houston and west to the 610 Loop. I-10/U.S. 90 borders the park to the north. The park was originally designed by landscape architects Hare & Hare of Kansas City, Missouri.\nFrom 1917 to 1923, the land where the park currently exists was the site of Camp Logan, a U.S. Army training camp. During World War I, the training camp was located on the far west boundaries of Houston. After the war in early 1924, Will and Mike Hogg, purchased 1,503 acres (6.1 km2) of former Camp Logan land and sold the area to the city at cost. In May 1924, the City of Houston took ownership of the land to be used as a \"memorial\" park, dedicated to the memory of soldiers who lost their lives in the war. The park is adjacent to the Camp Logan, Crestwood, and Rice Military neighborhoods.The park includes the 18-hole Memorial Park Golf Course, Texas's top-rated municipal golf course. Formerly the site of a nine-hole course launched in 1912, it was completely redesigned by John Bredemus and opened 84 years ago in 1936. The course rating is 75.0 with a slope rating of 130 from its back tees. Memorial Park hosted the Houston Open on the PGA Tour fourteen times (1947, 1951\u201363), and was renovated in 1995 at the cost of $7 million.  The course will host the tournament again in the 2021 season (October 2020).  The ashes of tour professional Dave Marr (1933\u20131997) were spread over the course, as it was where the winner of the 1965 PGA Championship learned to play the game.The park also has facilities for tennis, softball, swimming, track, croquet, volleyball, skating, cycling, and a running course (2.93 miles (4.72 km)). Very popular with Houston joggers, the running course is the Seymour Lieberman Exercise Trail, a crushed granite pathway that sees almost 3 million visits annually. For joggers used to running in the lush green surroundings it is disappointing to see the shrinkage in the number of trees as a result of drought and hurricanes.On the south side of Memorial Drive, there are miles of multi-use trails through the woods, a 'picnic' loop which is used heavily by road cyclists, softball fields, sand volleyball courts and a field for playing rugby or soccer. The softball fields are the home venue for the Texas Southern Tigers softball team.\nThe Houston Arboretum and Nature Center, an arboretum and botanical garden, sits on 155 acres (0.63 km2) within the park. The Nature Center building was constructed in 1967.Becks Prime has a location on the grounds of the Memorial Park golf course, as does Smoothie King The restaurant is within the clubhouse, overlooking the golf course.On April 25, 2018, philanthropists Rich and Nancy Kinder through their foundation, the Kinder Foundation, pledged $70 million to the Memorial Park Conservancy to accelerate redevelopment and restoration work.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nThe Houston riot of 1917 originated in Memorial Park.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMemorial Park Conservancy\nCity of Houston, Memorial Park\nHouston Arboretum and Nature Center\nMemorial Park Golf Course",

          "This park is over-rated. There's really not much to do here other than jog around a golf course. And for the most part, all you can see from the jogging trail are tall trees on one side and a road on the other. If there's an actual park with grass somewhere, and an open area,",
          "This is truly the best park in the country for outdoor activities. It provides jogging trail, walking, and bike trail. The bike trail takes you all the way to the heart of Downtown Houston and back all the way to Shepherd Drive alongside the bayou. It\u2019s always interesting with",

          "Houston is a big city, and it is absoultely wonderful that there's a fairly big area where kids and adults can enjoy the grass, the trees, the water and wild birds. Simply sitting on the grass is entertainment enough. But for my daughter, it was her 1st time to run barefoot on",

          "Dirt trails in the park for running/walk and they are flat - no surprise. However, there are single-track running trails south of the running building. Those provide more change in elevation. I was happy with the trails I initially mentioned because they are not paved, which is",

          "Still one of the most popular spots for jogging in Houston, this 3-mile (almost) loop makes for a great place for people spotting and heavy sweating. If you're a tourist visiting town, however, keep in mind that it is only one loop circling a golf course, and surrounded on all",
          "A great 3 mile loop plus a lot of other trails should you eventually get bored with the loop. It is great 9 months out of the year, dries up quickly after a rain, but a bit steamy in the summer.",

          "If you like golf you may be able to enjoy the park, since most of it is a golf course. The walking/running track on the outskirts of the golf course is great for those who like to run/walk. It is a sad waste of land lost to a golf course, but that is my opinion.",

          "Yes, it gets crowded in the evening or weekends. Parking will be pain during those peak hours too. And swerving around people who walk, and strollers, sometimes kids in their bicycles could be irritating. That's why I run early in the morning, 5 am. Or at night after 8 pm.",
          "Always LOTS of people jogging and walking the trail. Hard to find a parking spot. I prefer the trail around Rice University. It's also cooler in the summer because it has shade trees. If you're thinking of having a picnic, you really need to reserve in advance.",

        "wiki": "Houston ( (listen) HEW-st\u0259n) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Texas, fourth most populous city in the United States, most populous city in the Southern United States, as well as the sixth most populous in North America, with an estimated 2019 population of 2,320,268. Located in Southeast Texas near Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, it is the seat of Harris County and the principal city of the Greater Houston metropolitan area, which is the fifth most populous metropolitan statistical area in the United States and the second most populous in Texas after the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, with a population of 6,997,384 in 2018.Comprising a total area of 637.4 square miles (1,651 km2), Houston is the eighth most expansive city in the United States (including consolidated city-counties). It is the largest city in the United States by total area, whose government is not consolidated with that of a county, parish or borough. Though primarily in Harris County, small portions of the city extend into Fort Bend and Montgomery counties, bordering other principal communities of Greater Houston such as Sugar Land and The Woodlands.\nThe city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30, 1836, at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou (a point now known as Allen's Landing) and incorporated as a city on June 5, 1837. The city is named after former General Sam Houston, who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas' independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles (40 km) east of Allen's Landing. After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s, Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century.The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston, including a burgeoning port and railroad industry, the decline of Galveston as Texas' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane, the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel, and the Texas oil boom. In the mid-20th century, Houston's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center\u2014the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions\u2014and NASA's Johnson Space Center, where the Mission Control Center is located.\nHouston's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment, Houston has the second most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits (after New York City). The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled. Nicknamed the \"Bayou City\" \"Space City\", \"H-Town\", and \"the 713\", Houston has become a global city, with strengths in culture, medicine, and research. The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds and a large and growing international community. Houston is the most diverse metropolitan area in Texas and has been described as the most racially and ethnically diverse major metropolis in the U.S. It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, which attract more than 7 million visitors a year to the Museum District. Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene in the Theater District and offers year-round resident companies in all major performing arts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Houston area is located on land that was once home of the Karankawa (k\u0259 rang\u2032k\u0259 w\u00e4\u2032,-w\u00f4\u2032,-w\u0259) and the Atakapa (\u0259\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0k\u0259p\u0259) indigenous peoples for at least 2,000 years before the first known settlers arrived.  These tribes are almost nonexistent today; this was most likely caused by foreign disease, as well as competition with various exploration groups in the 18th and 19th centuries. However, the land remained largely uninhabited until settlement in the 1830s.The first documented settlers to arrive in the Houston area were the Allen brothers.\nThe Allen brothers\u2014Augustus Chapman and John Kirby\u2014explored town sites on Buffalo Bayou and Galveston Bay. According to historian David McComb, \"[T]he brothers, on August 26, 1836, bought from Elizabeth E. Parrott, wife of T.F.L. Parrott and widow of John Austin, the south half of the lower league [2,214-acre (896 ha) tract] granted to her by her late husband. They paid $5,000 total, but only $1,000 of this in cash; notes made up the remainder.\"The Allen brothers ran their first advertisement for Houston just four days later in the Telegraph and Texas Register, naming the notional town in honor of President Sam Houston. They successfully lobbied the Republic of Texas Congress to designate Houston as the temporary capital, agreeing to provide the new government with a state capitol building. About a dozen persons resided in the town at the beginning of 1837, but that number grew to about 1,500 by the time the Texas Congress convened in Houston for the first time that May. Houston was granted incorporation on June 5, 1837, with James S. Holman becoming its first mayor. In the same year, Houston became the county seat of Harrisburg County (now Harris County).In 1839, the Republic of Texas relocated its capital to Austin. The town suffered another setback that year when a yellow fever epidemic claimed about one life out of every eight residents. Yet it persisted as a commercial center, forming a symbiosis with its Gulf Coast port, Galveston. Landlocked farmers brought their produce to Houston, using Buffalo Bayou to gain access to Galveston and the Gulf of Mexico. Houston merchants profited from selling staples to farmers and shipping the farmers' produce to Galveston.The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but slave dealers were in Houston. Thousands of enslaved blacks lived near the city before the American Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs.\nIn 1840, the community established a chamber of commerce in part to promote shipping and navigation at the newly created port on Buffalo Bayou.\n\nBy 1860, Houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton. Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail lines to the ports of Galveston and Beaumont. During the American Civil War, Houston served as a headquarters for General John Magruder, who used the city as an organization point for the Battle of Galveston. After the Civil War, Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between Downtown and the nearby port of Galveston. By 1890, Houston was the railroad center of Texas.\nIn 1900, after Galveston was struck by a devastating hurricane, efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated. The following year, the discovery of oil at the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum industry. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $1 million improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel. By 1910, the city's population had reached 78,800, almost doubling from a decade before. African Americans formed a large part of the city's population, numbering 23,929 people, which was nearly one-third of Houston's residents.President Woodrow Wilson opened the deep-water Port of Houston in 1914, seven years after digging began. By 1930, Houston had become Texas' most populous city and Harris County the most populous county. In 1940, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Houston's population as 77.5% white and 22.4% black.When World War II started, tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.In 1945, the M.D. Anderson Foundation formed the Texas Medical Center. After the war, Houston's economy reverted to being primarily port-driven. In 1948, the city annexed several unincorporated areas, more than doubling its size. Houston proper began to spread across the region.In 1950, the availability of air conditioning provided impetus for many companies to relocate to Houston, where wages were lower than those in the North; this resulted in an economic boom and produced a key shift in the city's economy toward the energy sector.The increased production of the expanded shipbuilding industry during World War II spurred Houston's growth, as did the establishment in 1961 of NASA's \"Manned Spacecraft Center\" (renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1973). This was the stimulus for the development of the city's aerospace industry. The Astrodome, nicknamed the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\", opened in 1965 as the world's first indoor domed sports stadium.\nDuring the late 1970s, Houston had a population boom as people from the Rust Belt states moved to Texas in large numbers. The new residents came for numerous employment opportunities in the petroleum industry, created as a result of the Arab oil embargo. With the increase in professional jobs, Houston has become a destination for many college-educated persons, most recently including African Americans in a reverse Great Migration from northern areas.\nIn 1997, Houstonians elected Lee P. Brown as the city's first African American mayor.In June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison dumped up to 40 inches (1,000 mm) of rain on parts of Houston, causing what was then the worst flooding in the city's history. The storm cost billions of dollars in damage and killed 20 people in Texas. By December of the same year, Houston-based energy company Enron collapsed into the largest U.S. bankruptcy (at that time), a result of being investigated for off-the-books partnerships which were allegedly used to hide debt and inflate profits. The company lost no less than $70 billion.In August 2005, Houston became a shelter to more than 150,000 people from New Orleans, who evacuated from Hurricane Katrina. One month later, about 2.5 million Houston-area residents evacuated when Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf Coast, leaving little damage to the Houston area. This was the largest urban evacuation in the history of the United States. In September 2008, Houston was hit by Hurricane Ike. As many as 40% of residents refused to leave Galveston Island because they feared the type of traffic problems that had happened after Hurricane Rita.\nDuring its recent history, Houston has flooded several times from heavy rainfall, which has been becoming increasingly common. This has been exacerbated by a lack of zoning laws, which allowed unregulated building of residential homes and other structures in flood-prone areas. During the floods in 2015 and 2016, each of which dropped at least a foot of rain, parts of the city were covered in several inches of water. Even worse flooding happened in late August 2017, when Hurricane Harvey stalled over southeastern Texas, much like Tropical Storm Allison did sixteen years earlier, causing severe flooding in the Houston area, with some areas receiving over 50 inches (1,300 mm) of rain. The rainfall exceeded 50 inches in several areas locally, breaking the national record for rainfall. The damage for the Houston area is estimated at up to $125 billion U.S. dollars, and it is considered to be one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the United States, with the death toll exceeding 70 people. On January 31, 2018, the Houston City Council agreed to forgive large water bills thousands of households faced in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, as Houston Public Works found 6,362 homeowners' water utility bills had at least doubled.Houston has also been the site of numerous industrial disasters and construction accidents. In 2019, OSHA found that Texas was the leading state in the nation for crane accidents. In Houston, a 2008 crane collapse at a refinery killed 4 people and injured 6. The crane that collapsed was one of the largest cranes in the nation, possessing a 400-foot boom that can lift more than a million pounds.Due to the industrial infrastructure in and around Houston, natural disasters like Hurricane Harvey have also led to numerous toxic spills and disasters, including the 2017 Arkema plant explosion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHouston is located 165 miles (266 km) east of Austin, 88 miles (142 km) west of the Louisiana border, and 250 miles (400 km) south of Dallas. The city has a total area of 637.4 square miles (1,651 km2); this comprises over 599.59 square miles (1,552.9 km2) of land and 22.3 square miles (58 km2) covered by water. Most of Houston is located on the gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is classified as Western Gulf coastal grasslands while further north, it transitions into a subtropical jungle, the Big Thicket. Much of the city was built on forested land, marshes, or swamps, and are all still visible in surrounding areas. Flat terrain and extensive greenfield development have combined to worsen flooding. Downtown stands about 50 feet (15 m) above sea level, and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about 150 feet (46 m) in elevation. The city once relied on groundwater for its needs, but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground-level water sources such as Lake Houston, Lake Conroe, and Lake Livingston. The city owns surface water rights for 1.20 billion gallons of water a day in addition to 150 million gallons a day of groundwater.Houston has four major bayous passing through the city that accept water from the extensive drainage system. Buffalo Bayou runs through Downtown and the Houston Ship Channel, and has three tributaries: White Oak Bayou, which runs through the Houston Heights community northwest of Downtown and then towards Downtown; Brays Bayou, which runs along the Texas Medical Center; and Sims Bayou, which runs through the south of Houston and Downtown Houston. The ship channel continues past Galveston and then into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nHouston is a flat marshy area where an extensive drainage system has been built. The adjoining prairie land drains into the city, which is prone to flooding. Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.The Houston area has over 150 active faults (estimated to be 300 active faults) with an aggregate length of up to 310 miles (500 km), including the Long Point\u2013Eureka Heights fault system which runs through the center of the city. No significant historically recorded earthquakes have occurred in Houston, but researchers do not discount the possibility of such quakes having occurred in the deeper past, nor occurring in the future. Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years. It may be associated with slip along the faults; however, the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake, where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves. These faults also tend to move at a smooth rate in what is termed \"fault creep\", which further reduces the risk of an earthquake.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nHouston's climate is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system), typical of the Southern United States. While not located in Tornado Alley, like much of Northern Texas, spring supercell thunderstorms sometimes bring tornadoes to the area.Prevailing winds are from the south and southeast during most of the year, which bring heat and moisture from the nearby Gulf of Mexico and Galveston Bay.Summers in Houston are hot and humid. Temperatures in summer reach 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) almost daily. The city reaches or surpasses this temperature on an average of 107 days per year, including a majority of days from June to September; additionally, an average of 5 days per year reach or exceed 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Houston's characteristic subtropical humidity often results in a higher apparent temperature, and summer mornings average over 90% relative humidity. Air conditioning is ubiquitous in Houston; in 1981, annual spending on electricity for interior cooling exceeded $600 million (equivalent to $1.69 billion in 2019), and by the late 1990s, approximately 90% of Houston homes featured air conditioning systems. The record highest temperature recorded in Houston is 109 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C) at Bush Intercontinental Airport, during September 4, 2000, and again on August 27, 2011.\n\nHouston has mild winters, with occasional cold spells. In January, the normal mean temperature at George Bush Intercontinental Airport is 53 \u00b0F (12 \u00b0C), with an average of 13 days per year with a low at or below 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C), occurring on average between December 3 and February 20, allowing for a growing season of 286 days. Twenty-first century snow events in Houston include a storm on December 24, 2004, which saw 1 inch (3 cm) of snow accumulate in parts of the metro area, and an event on December 7, 2017, which precipitated 0.7 inches (2 cm) of snowfall. Snowfalls of at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) on both December 10, 2008, and December 4, 2009, marked the first time measurable snowfall had occurred in two consecutive years in the city's recorded history. Overall, Houston has seen measurable snowfall 38 times between 1895 and 2018. On February 14 and 15, 1895, Houston received 20 inches (51 cm) of snow, its largest snowfall from one storm on record. The coldest temperature officially recorded in Houston was 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) on January 18, 1930.Houston generally receives ample rainfall, averaging about 49.8 in (1,260 mm) annually based on records between 1981 and 2010. Many parts of the city have a high risk of localized flooding due to flat topography, ubiquitous low-permeability clay-silt prairie soils, and inadequate infrastructure. During the mid-2010s, Greater Houston experienced consecutive major flood events in 2015 (\"Memorial Day\"), 2016 (\"Tax Day\"), and 2017 (Hurricane Harvey). Overall, there have been more casualties and property loss from floods in Houston than in any other locality in the United States. The majority of rainfall occurs between April and October (the wet season of Southeast Texas), when the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico evaporates extensively over the city.Houston has excessive ozone levels and is routinely ranked among the most ozone-polluted cities in the United States. Ground-level ozone, or smog, is Houston's predominant air pollution problem, with the American Lung Association rating the metropolitan area's ozone level twelfth on the \"Most Polluted Cities by Ozone\" in 2017, after major cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix, New York City, and Denver. The industries located along the ship channel are a major cause of the city's air pollution. The rankings are in terms of peak-based standards, focusing strictly on the worst days of the year; the average ozone levels in Houston are lower than what is seen in most other areas of the country, as dominant winds ensure clean, marine air from the Gulf. Excessive man-made emissions in the Houston area led to a persistent increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide over the city. Such an increase, often regarded as \"CO2 urban dome,\" is driven by a combination of strong emissions and stagnant atmospheric conditions. Moreover, Houston is the only metropolitan area with less than ten million citizens where such CO2 dome can be detected by satellites.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\n\nBecause of Houston's ample year round rainfall and proximity to the Gulf Coast, the city is prone to flooding from heavy rains; the most notable flooding events include Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and Tropical Storm Imelda in 2019.  In response to Hurricane Harvey, Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston initiated plans to require developers to build homes that will be less susceptible to flooding by raising them two feet above the 500-year floodplains. Hurricane Harvey damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and dumped trillions of gallons of water into the city. In places this led to feet of standing water that blocked streets and flooded homes. The Houston City Council passed this regulation in 2018 with a vote of 9\u20137. If these rules had been in place earlier, it is estimated that 84% of homes in the 100-year and 500-year floodplains would not have been damaged.In a recent case of testing these regulations, near the Brickhouse Gulley, an old golf course that served as a floodplain and reservoir for flood waters, had been announced. A massive developer, Meritage Homes, bought the land and planned to develop the 500-year floodplain into 900 residential homes. Their plan would bring in $360 million in revenue and boost tax revenue for the city. In order to meet the new regulations, all they had to do was infill the site to raise its ground level two feet above the 500 year floodplain and build a trench to deal with runoff. Before Hurricane Harvey, the city bought $10.7 million in houses in this area specifically to take them out of a dangerous area. The sudden change of heart, especially after Hurricane Harvey seems likely to be motivated by additionally tax revenues. In addition to being a floodplain, this area is also a floodway, making it even more hazardous to live there. Harris County, like other counties, face the common issue that they can not direct developers where they can and can not build, instead they can only impose regulations.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nHouston was incorporated in 1837 and adopted a ward system of representation shortly afterward in 1840. The six original wards of Houston are the progenitors of the 11 modern-day geographically-oriented Houston City Council districts, though the city abandoned the ward system in 1905 in favor of a commission government, and, later, the existing mayor\u2013council government.\n\nLocations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the Interstate 610 loop. The \"Inner Loop\" encompasses a 97-square-mile (250 km2) area which includes Downtown, pre\u2013World War II residential neighborhoods and streetcar suburbs, and newer high-density apartment and townhouse developments. Outside the loop, the city's typology is more suburban, though many major business districts\u2014such as Uptown, Westchase, and the Energy Corridor\u2014lie well outside the urban core. In addition to Interstate 610, two additional loop highways encircle the city: Beltway 8, with a radius of approximately 10 miles (16 km) from Downtown, and State Highway 99 (the Grand Parkway), with a radius of 25 miles (40 km). Approximately 470,000 people live within the Interstate 610 loop, while 1.65 million live between Interstate 610 and Beltway 8 and 2.25 million live within Harris County outside Beltway 8 in 2015.Though Houston is the largest city in the United States without formal zoning regulations, it has developed similarly to other Sun Belt cities because the city's land use regulations and legal covenants have played a similar role. Regulations include mandatory lot size for single-family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers. Such restrictions have had mixed results. Though some have blamed the city's low density, urban sprawl, and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies, others have credited the city's land use patterns with providing significant affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the 2008 real estate crisis. The city issued 42,697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first in the list of healthiest housing markets for 2009.In referendums in 1948, 1962, and 1993, voters rejected efforts to establish separate residential and commercial land-use districts. Consequently, rather than a single central business district as the center of the city's employment, multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to Downtown, which include Uptown, the Texas Medical Center, Midtown, Greenway Plaza, Memorial City, the Energy Corridor, Westchase, and Greenspoint.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nHouston had the fifth-tallest skyline in North America (after New York City, Chicago, Toronto and Miami) and 36th-tallest in the world in 2015. A seven-mile (11 km) system of tunnels and skywalks links Downtown buildings containing shops and restaurants, enabling pedestrians to avoid summer heat and rain while walking between buildings.\nIn the 1960s, Downtown Houston consisted of a collection of midrise office structures. Downtown was on the threshold of an energy industry\u2013led boom in 1970. A succession of skyscrapers was built throughout the 1970s\u2014many by real estate developer Gerald D. Hines\u2014culminating with Houston's tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, 1,002-foot (305 m)-tall JPMorgan Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), completed in 1982. It is the tallest structure in Texas, 19th tallest building in the United States, and was previously 85th-tallest skyscraper in the world, based on highest architectural feature. In 1983, the 71-floor, 992-foot (302 m)-tall Wells Fargo Plaza (formerly Allied Bank Plaza) was completed, becoming the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas. Based on highest architectural feature, it is the 21st-tallest in the United States. In 2007, Downtown had over 43 million square feet (4,000,000 m\u00b2) of office space.\nCentered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the Uptown District boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of midrise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along Interstate 610 West. Uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, 901-foot (275 m)-tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the world's tallest skyscraper outside a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30 years. The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei, C\u00e9sar Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a mini-boom of midrise and highrise residential tower construction occurred, with several over 30 stories tall. Since 2000 over 30 skyscrapers have been developed in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units. In 2002, Uptown had more than 23 million square feet (2,100,000 m\u00b2) of office space with 16 million square feet (1,500,000 m\u00b2) of class A office space.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Houston had a population of 2,100,263 residents. In 2017, the census-estimated population rose to 2,312,717, and in 2018 to 2,325,502. An estimated 600,000 undocumented immigrants resided in the Houston area in 2017, comprising nearly 9% of the city's metropolitan population.Per the American Community Survey's 2014-2018 estimates, Houston's age distribution was 486,083 under 15; 147,710 aged 15 to 19; 603,586 aged 20 to 34; 726,877 aged 35 to 59; and 357,834 aged 60 and older. The median age was 33.1, up from 32.9 in 2017 and down from 33.5 in 2014; the city's youthfulness was attributed to an influx of an African American New Great Migration, Hispanic or Latin American, and Asian immigrants into Texas. For every 100 females, there were 98.5 males.There were 976,745 housing units in 2018 and 848,340 households. 42.9% of Houstonians owned housing units with an average of 2.67 persons per household. The median monthly owner costs with a mortgage were $1,598, and $524 without a mortgage. Houston's median gross rent from 2014-2018 was $990. The median household income in 2018 was $51,140 and 20.6% of Houstonians lived below the poverty line.\n\n\n=== Race and ethnicity ===\nHouston is a majority-minority city. The Rice University Kinder Institute for Urban Research, a think tank, has described Greater Houston as \"one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse metropolitan areas in the country\". Houston's diversity, fueled by large waves of immigrants, has been attributed to its relatively low cost of living, strong job market, and role as a hub for refugee resettlement. Houston has long been known as a popular destination for African-Americans due to the city's well-established and influential African American community. A 2012 Kinder Institute report found that, based on the evenness of population distribution between the four major racial groups in the United States (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian), Greater Houston was the most ethnically diverse metropolitan area in the United States, ahead of New York City. In 2017, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, non-Hispanic whites made up 24.9% of the population of Houston proper, Hispanics or Latinos 44.5%, Blacks or African Americans 22.9%, and Asians 6.7%. In 2018, non-Hispanic whites made up 24.6% of the population, Hispanics or Latinos 44.8%, Blacks or African Americans 22.5%, and Asians 6.9%.Compared with its metropolitan area, the city of Houston's population has a higher proportion of minorities than whites. In 2010, whites (including Hispanic whites) made up 51% of the city of Houston's population; 26% of the total population was non-Hispanic whites. Blacks or African Americans made up 25% of Houston's population, American Indians made up 0.7% of the population, Asians made up 6% (1.7% Vietnamese, 1.3% Chinese, 1.3% Indian, 0.9% Pakistani, 0.4% Filipino, 0.3% Korean, 0.1% Japanese) and Pacific Islanders made up 0.1%. Individuals from some other race made up 15.2% of the city's population, of which 0.2% were non-Hispanic. Individuals from two or more races made up 3.3% of the city.At the 2000 Census, the racial makeup of the city in was 49.3% White, 25.3% Black or African American, 5.3% Asian, 0.7% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 16.5% from some other race, and 3.1% from two or more races. In addition, Hispanics made up 37.4% of Houston's population in 2000, while non-Hispanic whites made up 30.8%. The proportion of non-Hispanic whites in Houston has decreased significantly since 1970, when it was 62.4%.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nHistorically, Houston has been a center of Protestant Christianity, being part of the Bible Belt. Other Christian groups including Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Christianity, and non-Christian religions did not grow for much of the city's history because immigration was predominantly from Western Europe (which at the time was dominated by Western Christianity and favored by the quotas in federal immigration law). The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 removed the quotas, allowing for the growth of other religions.According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 73% of the population of the Houston area identified themselves as Christians, about 50% of whom claimed Protestant affiliations and about 19% claimed Roman Catholic affiliations. Nationwide, about 71% of respondents identified as Christians. About 20% of Houston-area residents claimed no religious affiliation, compared to about 23% nationwide. The same study says that area residents identifying with other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively made up about 7% of the area population.\nLakewood Church in Houston, led by Pastor Joel Osteen, is the largest church in the United States. A megachurch, it had 44,800 weekly attendees in 2010, up from 11,000 weekly in 2000. Since 2005 it has occupied the former Compaq Center sports stadium. In September 2010, Outreach Magazine published a list of the 100 largest Christian churches in the United States, and inside the list were the following Houston-area churches: Lakewood, Second Baptist Church Houston, Woodlands Church, Church Without Walls and First Baptist Church. According to the list, Houston and Dallas were tied as the second most popular city for megachurches.The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, the largest Catholic jurisdiction in Texas and fifth-largest in the United States, was established in 1847. The Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston claims approximately 1.7 million Catholics within its boundaries.A variety of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches can be found in Houston. Immigrants from Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Ethiopia, India and other areas have added to Houston's Eastern and Oriental Orthodox population. As of 2011 in the entire State of Texas there were 32,000 people who actively attend Orthodox churches. In 2013 Father John Whiteford, the pastor of St. Jonah Orthodox Church near Spring, stated that there were about 6,000-9,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians in Houston.Houston's Jewish community, estimated at 47,000 in 2001, has been present in the city since the 1800's. Houstonian Jews have origins from throughout the United States, Israel, Mexico, Russia, and other places. As of 2016 there were over 40 synagogues in Greater Houston. The largest synagogues in Houston are Congregation Beth Yeshurun, a Conservative Jewish temple, and the Reform Jewish congregations Beth Israel and Emanu-El.\nHouston has a large and diverse Muslim community; the largest in Texas and the Southern United States, as of 2012. It is estimated that Muslims make up 1.2% of Houston's population. As of 2016, Muslims in the Houston area included South Asians, Middle Easterners, Africans, Turks, and Indonesians. In 2000 there were over 41 mosques and storefront religious centers, with the largest being the Al-Noor Mosque (Mosque of Light) of the Islamic Society of Greater Houston.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHouston is recognized worldwide for its energy industry\u2014particularly for oil and natural gas\u2014as well as for biomedical research and aeronautics. Renewable energy sources\u2014wind and solar\u2014are also growing economic bases in the city.  The Houston Ship Channel is also a large part of Houston's economic base. Because of these strengths, Houston is designated as a global city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network and global management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. The Houston area is the top U.S. market for exports, surpassing New York City in 2013, according to data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration. In 2012, the Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land area recorded $110.3 billion in merchandise exports. Petroleum products, chemicals, and oil and gas extraction equipment accounted for roughly two-thirds of the metropolitan area's exports last year. The top three destinations for exports were Mexico, Canada, and Brazil.The Houston area is a leading center for building oilfield equipment. Much of its success as a petrochemical complex is due to its busy ship channel, the Port of Houston. In the United States, the port ranks first in international commerce and 16th among the largest ports in the world. Unlike most places, high oil and gasoline prices are beneficial for Houston's economy, as many of its residents are employed in the energy industry. Houston is the beginning or end point of numerous oil, gas, and products pipelines.The Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land metro area's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016 was $478 billion, making it the sixth-largest of any metropolitan area in the United States and larger than Iran's, Colombia's, or the United Arab Emirates' GDP. Only 27 countries other than the United States have a gross domestic product exceeding Houston's regional gross area product (GAP). In 2010, mining (which consists almost entirely of exploration and production of oil and gas in Houston) accounted for 26.3% of Houston's GAP up sharply in response to high energy prices and a decreased worldwide surplus of oil production capacity, followed by engineering services, health services, and manufacturing.The University of Houston System's annual impact on the Houston area's economy equates to that of a major corporation: $1.1 billion in new funds attracted annually to the Houston area, $3.13 billion in total economic benefit, and 24,000 local jobs generated. This is in addition to the 12,500 new graduates the U.H. System produces every year who enter the workforce in Houston and throughout Texas. These degree-holders tend to stay in Houston. After five years, 80.5% of graduates are still living and working in the region.In 2006, the Houston metropolitan area ranked first in Texas and third in the U.S. within the category of \"Best Places for Business and Careers\" by Forbes magazine. Ninety-one foreign governments have established consular offices in Houston's metropolitan area, the third-highest in the nation. Forty foreign governments maintain trade and commercial offices here with 23 active foreign chambers of commerce and trade associations. Twenty-five foreign banks representing 13 nations operate in Houston, providing financial assistance to the international community.In 2008, Houston received top ranking on Kiplinger's Personal Finance \"Best Cities of 2008\" list, which ranks cities on their local economy, employment opportunities, reasonable living costs, and quality of life. The city ranked fourth for highest increase in the local technological innovation over the preceding 15 years, according to Forbes magazine. In the same year, the city ranked second on the annual Fortune 500 list of company headquarters, first for Forbes magazine's \"Best Cities for College Graduates\", and first on their list of \"Best Cities to Buy a Home\". In 2010, the city was rated the best city for shopping, according to Forbes.In 2012, the city was ranked number one for paycheck worth by Forbes and in late May 2013, Houston was identified as America's top city for employment creation.In 2013, Houston was identified as the number one U.S. city for job creation by the U.S. Bureau of Statistics after it was not only the first major city to regain all the jobs lost in the preceding economic downturn, but also after the crash, more than two jobs were added for every one lost. Economist and vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership Patrick Jankowski attributed Houston's success to the ability of the region's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes.

Houston is a home rule city and all municipal elections in the Texas are nonpartisan. The city's elected officials are the mayor, city controller and 16 members of the Houston City Council. The current mayor of Houston is Sylvester Turner, a Democrat elected on a nonpartisan ballot. Houston's mayor serves as the city's chief administrator, executive officer, and official representative, and is responsible for the general management of the city and for seeing that all laws and ordinances are enforced.The original city council line-up of 14 members (nine district-based and five at-large positions) was based on a U.S. Justice Department mandate which took effect in 1979. At-large council members represent the entire city. Under the city charter, once the population in the city limits exceeded 2.1 million residents, two additional districts were to be added. The city of Houston's official 2010 census count was 600 shy of the required number; however, as the city was expected to grow beyond 2.1 million shortly thereafter, the two additional districts were added for, and the positions filled during, the August 2011 elections.\nThe city controller is elected independently of the mayor and council. The controller's duties are to certify available funds prior to committing such funds and processing disbursements. The city's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Chris Brown is the city controller, serving his first term as of January 2016.\nAs the result of a 2015 referendum in Houston, a mayor is elected for a four-year term, and can be elected to as many as two consecutive terms. The term limits were spearheaded in 1991 by conservative political activist Clymer Wright. During 1991\u20132015, the city controller and city council members were subjected to a two-year, three-term limitation \u2013 the 2015 referendum amended term limits to two four-year terms. As of 2017 some councilmembers who served two terms and won a final term will have served eight years in office, whereas a freshman councilmember who won a position in 2013 can serve up to two additional terms under the previous term limit law \u2013 a select few will have at least 10 years of incumbency once their term expires.\n\nHouston is considered to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats. Much of the city's wealthier areas vote Republican while the city's working class and minority areas vote Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68 percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats. About 62 percent of Hispanics (of any race) in the area are declared or favor Democrats. The city has often been known to be the most politically diverse city in Texas, a state known for being generally conservative. As a result, the city is often a contested area in statewide elections. In 2009, Houston became the first U.S. city with a population over 1 million citizens to elect a gay mayor, by electing Annise Parker.Texas has banned sanctuary cities, but Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said that Houston will not assist ICE agents with immigration raids.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nHouston had 303 homicides in 2015 and 302 homicides in 2016. Officials predicted there would be 323 homicides in 2016. Instead, there was no increase in Houston's homicide rate between 2015 and 2016.Houston's murder rate ranked 46th of U.S. cities with a population over 250,000 in 2005 (per capita rate of 16.3 murders per 100,000 population). In 2010, the city's murder rate (per capita rate of 11.8 murders per 100,000 population) was ranked sixth among U.S. cities with a population of over 750,000 (behind New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, and Philadelphia) according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nMurders fell by 37 percent from January to June 2011, compared with the same period in 2010. Houston's total crime rate including violent and nonviolent crimes decreased by 11 percent. The FBI's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) indicates a downward trend of violent crime in Houston over the ten- and twenty-year periods ending in 2016, which is consistent with national trends. This trend toward lower rates of violent crime in Houston includes the murder rate, though it had seen a four-year uptick that lasted through 2015. Houston's violent crime rate was 8.6% percent higher in 2016 from the previous year. However, from 2006 to 2016, violent crime was still down 12 percent in Houston.Houston is a significant hub for trafficking of cocaine, cannabis, heroin, MDMA, and methamphetamine due to its size and proximity to major illegal drug exporting nations. Houston is one of the country's largest hubs for human trafficking.In the early 1970s, Houston, Pasadena and several coastal towns were the site of the Houston mass murders, which at the time were the deadliest case of serial killing in American history.In 1853 the first execution in Houston took place in public at Founder's Cemetery in the Fourth Ward; initially the cemetery was the execution site, but post-1868 executions took place in the jail facilities.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nNineteen school districts exist within the city of Houston. The Houston Independent School District (HISD) is the seventh-largest school district in the United States and the largest in Texas. HISD has 112 campuses that serve as magnet or vanguard schools\u2014specializing in such disciplines as health professions, visual and performing arts, and the sciences. There are also many charter schools that are run separately from school districts. In addition, some public school districts also have their own charter schools.\nThe Houston area encompasses more than 300 private schools, many of which are accredited by Texas Private School Accreditation Commission recognized agencies. The Houston Area independent schools offer education from a variety of different religious as well as secular viewpoints. The Houston area Catholic schools are operated by the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nFour distinct state universities are located in Houston. The University of Houston (UH) is a nationally recognized tier one research university and is the flagship institution of the University of Houston System. The third-largest university in Texas, the University of Houston has nearly 44,000 students on its 667-acre (270-hectare) campus in the Third Ward. The University of Houston\u2013Clear Lake and the University of Houston\u2013Downtown are stand-alone universities within the University of Houston System; they are not branch campuses of the University of Houston. Slightly west of the University of Houston is Texas Southern University (TSU), one of the largest and most comprehensive historically black universities in the United States with approximately 10,000 students. Texas Southern University is the first state university in Houston, founded in 1927.Several private institutions of higher learning are located within the city. Rice University, the most selective university in Texas and one of the most selective in the United States, is a private, secular institution with a high level of research activity. Founded in 1912, Rice's historic, heavily wooded 300-acre (120-hectare) campus, located adjacent to Hermann Park and the Texas Medical Center, hosts approximately 4,000 undergraduate and 3,000 post-graduate students. To the north in Neartown, the University of St. Thomas, founded in 1947, is Houston's only Catholic university. St. Thomas provides a liberal arts curriculum for roughly 3,000 students at its historic 19-block campus along Montrose Boulevard. In southwest Houston, Houston Baptist University (HBU), founded in 1960, offers bachelor's and graduate degrees at its Sharpstown campus. The school is affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas and has a student population of approximately 3,000.\nThree community college districts have campuses in and around Houston. The Houston Community College System (HCC) serves most of Houston proper; its main campus and headquarters are located in Midtown. Suburban northern and western parts of the metropolitan area are served by various campuses of the Lone Star College System, while the southeastern portion of Houston is served by San Jacinto College, and a northeastern portion is served by Lee College. The Houston Community College and Lone Star College systems are among the 10 largest institutions of higher learning in the United States.\nHouston also hosts a number of graduate schools in law and healthcare. The University of Houston Law Center and Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University are public, ABA-accredited law schools, while the South Texas College of Law, located in Downtown, serves as a private, independent alternative. The Texas Medical Center is home to a high density of health professions schools, including two medical schools: McGovern Medical School, part of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and Baylor College of Medicine, a highly selective private institution. Prairie View A&M University's nursing school is located in the Texas Medical Center. Additionally, both Texas Southern University and the University of Houston have pharmacy schools, and the University of Houston hosts a college of optometry.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe primary network-affiliated television stations are KPRC-TV (NBC), KHOU (CBS), KTRK-TV (ABC), KRIV (Fox), KIAH (The CW), KTXH (MyNetworkTV), KXLN-DT (Univision) and KTMD-TV (Telemundo). KTRK-TV, KRIV, KTXH, KXLN-DT and KTMD-TV operate as owned-and-operated stations of their networks.\nThe Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land metropolitan area is served by one public television station and one public radio station. KUHT (Houston Public Media) is a PBS member station and is the first public television station in the United States. Houston Public Radio is listener-funded and comprises one NPR member station, KUHF (News 88.7). The University of Houston System owns and holds broadcasting licenses to KUHT and KUHF. The stations broadcast from the Melcher Center for Public Broadcasting, located on the campus of the University of Houston.\nHouston is served by the Houston Chronicle, its only major daily newspaper with wide distribution. The Hearst Corporation, which owns and operates the Houston Chronicle, bought the assets of the Houston Post\u2014its long-time rival and main competition\u2014when Houston Post ceased operations in 1995. The Houston Post was owned by the family of former Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby of Houston. The only other major publication to serve the city is the Houston Press\u2014which was a free alternative weekly newspaper before the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey resulted in the publication switching to an online-only format on November 2, 2017.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\nHouston is the seat of the Texas Medical Center, which describes itself as containing the world's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions. All 49 member institutions of the Texas Medical Center are non-profit organizations. They provide patient and preventive care, research, education, and local, national, and international community well-being. Employing more than 73,600 people, institutions at the medical center include 13 hospitals and two specialty institutions, two medical schools, four nursing schools, and schools of dentistry, public health, pharmacy, and virtually all health-related careers. It is where one of the first\u2014and still the largest\u2014air emergency service, Life Flight, was created, and an inter-institutional transplant program was developed. Around 2007, more heart surgeries were performed at the Texas Medical Center than anywhere else in the world.Some of the academic and research health institutions at the center include MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, UT Health Science Center, Memorial Hermann Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, Texas Children's Hospital, and University of Houston College of Pharmacy.\nIn the 2000s, the Baylor College of Medicine was annually considered within the top ten medical schools in the nation; likewise, the MD Anderson Cancer Center had been consistently ranked as one of the top two U.S. hospitals specializing in cancer care by U.S. News & World Report since 1990. The Menninger Clinic, a psychiatric treatment center, is affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine and the Houston Methodist Hospital System. With hospital locations nationwide and headquarters in Houston, the Triumph Healthcare hospital system was the third largest long term acute care provider nationally in 2005.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nHouston is considered an automobile-dependent city, with an estimated 77.2% of commuters driving alone to work in 2016, up from 71.7% in 1990 and 75.6% in 2009. In 2016, another 11.4% of Houstonians carpooled to work, while 3.6% used public transit, 2.1% walked, and 0.5% bicycled. A commuting study estimated that the median length of commute in the region was 12.2 miles (19.6 km) in 2012. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, the average work commute in Houston (city) takes 26.3 minutes. A 1999 Murdoch University study found that Houston had both the lengthiest commute and lowest urban density of 13 large American cities surveyed, and a 2017 Arcadis study ranked Houston 22nd out of 23 American cities in transportation sustainability. Harris County is one of the largest consumers of gasoline in the United States, ranking second (behind Los Angeles County) in 2013.Despite the region's high rate of automobile usage, attitudes towards transportation among Houstonians indicate a growing preference for walkability. A 2017 study by the Rice University Kinder Institute for Urban Research found that 56% of Harris County residents have a preference for dense housing in a mixed-use, walkable setting as opposed to single-family housing in a low-density area. A plurality of survey respondents also indicated that traffic congestion was the most significant problem facing the metropolitan area. In addition, many households in the city of Houston have no car. In 2015, 8.3 percent of Houston households lacked a car, which was virtually unchanged in 2016 (8.1 percent). The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Houston averaged 1.59 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.\n\n\n=== Roadways ===\n\nThe eight-county Greater Houston metropolitan area contains over 25,000 miles (40,000 km) of roadway, of which 10%, or approximately 2,500 miles (4,000 km), is limited-access highway. The Houston region's extensive freeway system handles over 40% of the regional daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Arterial roads handle an additional 40% of daily VMT, while toll roads, of which Greater Houston has 180 miles (290 km), handle nearly 10%.Greater Houston possesses a hub-and-spoke limited-access highway system, in which a number of freeways radiate outward from Downtown, with ring roads providing connections between these radial highways at intermediate distances from the city center. The city is crossed by three Interstate highways, Interstate 10, Interstate 45, and Interstate 69 (commonly known as U.S. Route 59), as well as a number of other United States routes and state highways. Major freeways in Greater Houston are often referred to by either the cardinal direction or geographic location they travel towards. Highways that follow the cardinal convention include U.S. Route 290 (Northwest Freeway), Interstate 45 north of Downtown (North Freeway), Interstate 10 east of Downtown (East Freeway), Texas State Highway 288 (South Freeway), and Interstate 69 south of Downtown (Southwest Freeway). Highways that follow the location convention include Interstate 10 west of Downtown (Katy Freeway), Interstate 69 north of Downtown (Eastex Freeway), Interstate 45 south of Downtown (Gulf Freeway), and Texas State Highway 225 (La Porte or Pasadena Freeway).\nThree loop freeways provide north\u2013south and east\u2013west connectivity between Greater Houston's radial highways. The innermost loop is Interstate 610, commonly known as the Inner Loop, which encircles Downtown, the Texas Medical Center, Greenway Plaza, the cities of West University Place and Southside Place, and many core neighborhoods. The 88-mile (142 km) State Highway Beltway 8, often referred to as the Beltway, forms the middle loop at a radius of roughly 10 miles (16 km). A third, 180-mile (290 km) loop with a radius of approximately 25 miles (40 km), State Highway 99 (the Grand Parkway), is currently under construction, with six of eleven segments completed as of 2018. Completed segments D through G provide a continuous 70.4-mile (113.3 km) limited-access tollway connection between Sugar Land, Katy, Cypress, Spring, and Porter.A system of toll roads, operated by the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA) and Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority (FBCTRA), provides additional options for regional commuters. The Sam Houston Tollway, which encompasses the mainlanes of Beltway 8 (as opposed to the frontage roads, which are untolled), is the longest tollway in the system, covering the entirety of the Beltway with the exception of a free section between Interstate 45 and Interstate 69 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The region is serviced by four spoke tollways: a set of managed lanes on the Katy Freeway; the Hardy Toll Road, which parallels Interstate 45 north of Downtown up to Spring; the Westpark Tollway, which services Houston's western suburbs out to Fulshear; and Fort Bend Parkway, which connects to Sienna Plantation. Westpark Tollway and Fort Bend Parkway are operated conjunctly with the Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority.\nGreater Houston's freeway system is monitored by Houston TranStar, a partnership of four government agencies which is responsible for providing transportation and emergency management services to the region.Greater Houston's arterial road network is established at the municipal level, with the City of Houston exercising planning control over both its incorporated area and extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). Therefore, Houston exercises transportation planning authority over a 2,000-square-mile (5,200 km2) area over five counties, many times larger than its corporate area. The Major Thoroughfare and Freeway Plan, updated annually, establishes the city's street hierarchy, identifies roadways in need of widening, and proposes new roadways in unserved areas. Arterial roads are organized into four categories, in decreasing order of intensity: major thoroughfares, transit corridor streets, collector streets, and local streets. Roadway classification affects anticipated traffic volumes, roadway design, and right of way breadth. Ultimately, the system is designed to ferry traffic from neighborhood streets to major thoroughfares, which connect into the limited-access highway system. Notable arterial roads in the region include Westheimer Road, Memorial Drive, Texas State Highway 6, Farm to Market Road 1960, Bellaire Boulevard, and Telephone Road.\n\n\n=== Transit ===\n\nThe Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (METRO) provides public transportation in the form of buses, light rail, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, and paratransit to fifteen municipalities throughout the Greater Houston area and parts of unincorporated Harris County. METRO's service area covers 1,303 square miles (3,370 km2) containing a population of 3.6 million.METRO's local bus network services approximately 275,000 riders daily with a fleet of over 1,200 buses. The agency's 75 local routes contain nearly 8,900 stops and saw nearly 67 million boardings during the 2016 fiscal year. A park and ride system provides commuter bus service from 34 transit centers scattered throughout the region's suburban areas; these express buses operate independently of the local bus network and utilize the region's extensive system of HOV lanes. Downtown and the Texas Medical Center have the highest rates of transit use in the region, largely due to the park and ride system, with nearly 60% of commuters in each district utilizing public transit to get to work.METRO began light rail service in 2004 with the opening of the 8-mile (13 km) north-south Red Line connecting Downtown, Midtown, the Museum District, the Texas Medical Center, and NRG Park. In the early 2010s, two additional lines\u2014the Green Line, servicing the East End, and the Purple Line, servicing the Third Ward\u2014opened, and the Red Line was extended northward to Northline, bringing the total length of the system to 22.7 miles (36.5 km). Two light rail lines outlined in a five-line system approved by voters in a 2003 referendum have yet to be constructed. The Uptown Line, which would run along Post Oak Boulevard in Uptown, is currently under construction as a bus rapid transit line\u2014the city's first\u2014while the University Line has been postponed indefinitely. The light rail system saw approximately 16.8 million boardings in fiscal year 2016.Amtrak's thrice-weekly Los Angeles\u2013New Orleans Sunset Limited serves Houston at a station northwest of downtown. There were 14,891 boardings and alightings in FY2008,, 20,327 in FY2012, and 20,205 in FY2018.A daily Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach connects Houston with Amtrak's Chicago\u2013San Antonio Texas Eagle at Longview.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nHouston City Council approved the Houston Bike Plan in March 2017, at that time entering the plan into the Houston Code of Ordinances.Houston has the largest number of bike commuters in Texas with over 160 miles of dedicated bikeways. The city is currently in the process of expanding its on and off street bikeway network. In 2015, Downtown Houston added a cycle track on Lamar Street, running from Sam Houston Park to Discovery Green. In August 2017, Houston City Council approved spending for construction of 13 additional miles of bike trails.Houston's bicycle sharing system started service with nineteen stations in May 2012. Houston Bcycle (also known as B-Cycle), a local non-profit, runs the subscription program, supplying bicycles and docking stations, while partnering with other companies to maintain the system. The network expanded to 29 stations and 225 bicycles in 2014, registering over 43,000 checkouts of equipment during the first half of the same year. In 2017, Bcycle logged over 142,000 check outs while expanding to 56 docking stations.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe Houston Airport System, a branch of the municipal government, oversees the operation of three major public airports in the city. Two of these airports, George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P. Hobby Airport, offer commercial aviation service to a variety of domestic and international destinations and served 55 million passengers in 2016. The third, Ellington Airport, is home to the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base. The Federal Aviation Administration and the state of Texas selected the Houston Airport System as \"Airport of the Year\" in 2005, largely due to the implementation of a $3.1 billion airport improvement program for both major airports in Houston.George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), located 23 miles (37 km) north of Downtown Houston between Interstates 45 and 69, is the eighth busiest commercial airport in the United States (by total passengers and aircraft movements) and forty-third busiest globally. The five-terminal, five-runway, 11,000-acre (4,500-hectare) airport served 40 million passengers in 2016, including 10 million international travelers. In 2006, the United States Department of Transportation named IAH the fastest-growing of the top ten airports in the United States. The Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center is located at Bush Intercontinental.\nHouston was the headquarters of Continental Airlines until its 2010 merger with United Airlines with headquarters in Chicago; regulatory approval for the merger was granted in October of that year. Bush Intercontinental is currently United Airlines' second largest hub, behind O'Hare International Airport. United Airlines' share of the Houston Airport System's commercial aviation market was nearly 60% in 2017 with 16 million enplaned passengers. In early 2007, Bush Intercontinental Airport was named a model \"port of entry\" for international travelers by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), known as Houston International Airport until 1967, operates primarily short- to medium-haul domestic and international flights to 60 destinations. The four-runway, 1,304-acre (528-hectare) facility is located approximately 7 miles (11 km) southeast of Downtown Houston. In 2015, Southwest Airlines launched service from a new international terminal at Hobby to several destinations in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. These were the first international flights flown from Hobby since the opening of Bush Intercontinental in 1969. Houston's aviation history is showcased in the 1940 Air Terminal Museum, located in the old terminal building on the west side of the airport. In 2009, Hobby Airport was recognized with two awards for being one of the top five performing airports globally and for customer service by Airports Council International.Houston's third municipal airport is Ellington Airport, used by the military, government (including NASA) and general aviation sectors.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nThe Houston Office of Protocol and International Affairs is the city's liaison to Houston's sister cities and to the national governing organization, Sister Cities International.

          "Lots of fun things to do - great learning experience for all. Innovative with a good verity off children learning experiences.",
          "This plase I reconmend for all families. The games were awsome for the kids to play. We had a wounderfull time.Be prepared to stay for a while.",
          "I was very surprised at all the hands on activities for the children. Our grandchildren, ages 10 - 18, LOVED it!",
          "There are 3 floors with about 20 different sections. Most are best for ages 4-7 Although the toddler area upstairs was good, there isn\u2019t much to do fur small kids like our 2 year old daughter so I think it should be cheaper for 2-3yr olds. Good activity for a rainy day.",
          "Depending on your view I tend to think of Museum as about the past but this children's exploratory uses gadgets galore to teach kids physics, chemistry, motor skills with careers and STEM guidance dotted around for good measure. The huge climbing net at the back of the building",
          "Took my 2 granddaughters here and they had a massive amount of fun. There were so many activities for them to do. I was exhausted chasing them from place to palce, but they had a ball",
          "We took our 2 girls (2 and 3). It was crazy busy on a weekend and you could hardly play with anything as there were so many kids. Although i think it has a lot to offer and love the outside area, i think its amazing for 4 and up. Bonus we got in free with our Austin Thinkery",
          "Interactive, fun learning. Wide range of activites to engage children especially 4 to 12. Definitely visit Kidtropolis, How Does It Work and FlowWorks. Loved the healthy options at the cafe and the attentiveness of staff. Would visit again and again.",
          "I would have given it 5 starts. It is a Great museum for kids but way too crowded during the winter break.",
          "$12 per person, same ticket price for kids too. No free parking nearby. Located in the museum district of Houston downtown. Metered street parking available and about $5 for 2.5 hours. One can easily spend 2-3 hours there. There are many things to see, do and participate",
          "There's so much there for children to see and do. I've talked all 3 grandchildren there with my wife. The kids are from 6-22 and there's something to interest and entertain all of them!",
          "We were pleasantly surprised how good this place was - our 12 year old enjoyed it big time and got engaged since the time we entered the place. Highly recommend",
          "This is a heaven for kids and where they can spend hours exploring, playing and letting some of their energy out. There are many different areas to explore ranging from infants/toddlers activities to school children in terms of difficulty/theme. The caf\u00e9 servces surprisingly",
          "The Children's Museum is a dreamscape for kids. There is so much for them to do the is fun and educational. It does get really crowded on holidays, so I would recommend going as early as possible.",
          "I have very low expectation because of the title, but OMG this place is to die for. My kids age 5,7,9 all had fun and us parents are excited and enjoyed the games!!! Absolutely worth the trip and we will go again and again (infinite). We spent 4 hours here and cannot get enough",

          "We had a good time but I\u2019m very perplexed by the lack of highchairs in the cafe. The worker kindly shrugged her shoulders saying she was told it was due to a fire hazard risk. Odd considering every other restaurant in Houston has highchairs. Otherwise, my 15 mo old had fun. I",

          "We had a fantastic family time, with lots of fun and learning experience. My son loved the Invention Convention the most. He didn\u2019t want to leave that place. We will definitely come back if we get back to Houston.",
          "It has it all! There is a tots only area for children that aren't quite ready to explore the entire museum fully. The rest of the museum is great for learning children!",
          "Anna and her team did a phenomenal job helping me plan and execute my daughter's 4th birthday. Not only was it turnkey - which is super sweet for working moms like me who have little time to worry about details like baloon colors and where to buy food - but the staff couldn't",
          "This museum is fantastic! The kids loved all the hands on exhibits. There is so much to see and experiment with, you could fill up most of the day here.",
          "My son had a Great time here, we spent about 4 hours going thru things and activities. Be prepared though it gets very busy. Parking is going to cost you $9.00 in the garage across the street.",
          "We thought this was a neat place, but we ultimately could not handle the crowds. We visited on a Sunday afternoon. We left in less than 30 minutes, and my kids interacted with very few exhibits.",

          "My kids loved this children's museum! They most enjoyed the area where they got to have a \"job\" and \"get paid\" but were disappointed when it wasn't real stuff they could buy with that money. haha. Overall they had a great time at this museum! The outdoor water was nice that it",
          "Excellent, thoroughly enjoyable day out. Our 10yr old son loved the mushroom climber, the ropes course and the outdoor water play. We visited as part of the Houston city pass and were very happy we did.",
          "Amazingly fun. Amazingly crowded. Sensory overload. Probably best for a weekday visit when it isnt so hectic",
          "There is a lot to do of course, and my kids did enjoy the museum but I found a few of the sections lacking some fun factor at times. I'm not sure if it is always there but the actual grand hit of the whole place was the little city set up for kids with a grocery store,",
          "Well this was a great way to spend an afternoon, lots of exploring and hands on activities, even a kids grocery store with toy items which seemed to be where all the kids wanted to shop! From painting to climbing this was a fun filled day. There is even a toddler play area, but",
          "It is good attractions for kids to be visited as once, I was disappointed as I have visited other children museums worldwide unfortunately this is the lowest rate and experience",
          "I just went here with the kids, it has been upgraded since my last visit. There is so much to see, with most of it interactive. Check out their online schedule to see when special performances are held. When we went, there was a juggling act. You have to pay for parking. :-(",
          "Kind of expensive for such a small area... It's very busy they also have seating outside... Parking is kind of hard to find but get there early.",
          "I had so many incredible memories of visiting this place as a child. It was disappointing going back with my own kids! So many of the things were broken or out of order. Many of the exhibits were missing parts and pieces, things were incredibly disorganized, and the staff were",
          "My 15 month old toddler LOVES this place. Easily a place to keep returning as he ages. I can set him down in the tot spot and just make sure he doesn't hurt himself - but he's on his own, running around checking out all there is to do. He loves it. We'll keep brining him",
          "My family of four came to Houston for a quick get away and decided to go to the Children\u2019s Museum for something fun to do. The kids really enjoyed this! There\u2019s a baby and tots section on the 2nd floor. I think it\u2019s only under two allowed in. There\u2019s a little section out side",
          "We were amazed by this place. All 3 children 7,6, and 2 had a great time. There\u2019s something for everyone. My husband and I also had a great time. The food it good! We had cheeseburgers, we all recommend. If you\u2019re in the area this is a must. Do the water part last though because",
          "This place is awesome for preschool aged children. It is definitely a place to explore the \u2018how\u2019s and whys\u2019 of the world. Make sure you expose your children early to this type of exploration through play or it will feel a little too much like school. I wish my community had more",
          "Yes we picked a very busy to visit with a 19 month old toddler! But the museum was just right with activities that worked. The toddler play area was full of interactive and learning-based toys and activities- enough to entertain for at least an hour. The other main area we hit",
          "I really watched my children interact with all the various activities.I recommend the Museum for schhol field trips,birthday travel,vacation activities,and summer vacation as well. Its a great place for parents with small children who have a great amount of energy to burn off if",
          "Very nice place definitely reccommend!!! Once you think you have see all it has to offer then there are two more floors, outside water fun, and a cafe!! Great for a half day visit to Houston!!! Prices are very affordable!",
          "Great place for kids to play explore and learn. The kids town is great. My daughter, who is 21 months, loved at vet and painting.",
          "Plan on staying for a few hours and tagging along in the fun with the kids. Each area is unique and creative. All areas are HANDS ON and encourages wonder and play. A must if you're visiting from out of town or live in Houston and come regularly.",
          "I will start off by saying that this review is based of a Spring Break 2019 visit. I was disappointed with the Children's Museum. It was my first time visiting and I really didn't know what to expect. I will say, I grew up visiting COSI so I had pretty high expectations. I have",
          "You could easily fill an entire afternoon at this museum. In addition to typical kids museum stuff, there\u2019s a climbing area, a kids metropolis for kids to experience earning and spending money, and even outside area with water activities!",
          "This place is great for children of all ages. I have been bringing my children here since they were little and now they're teenagers and still love to go here as well as the whole family! It's a great hands-on with plenty of learning exhibits and activities. There's always fun",
          "We signed my teens up for their \"Spy\" scavenger hunt. They really enjoyed themselves! They pretty much had to visit each area, so they got to do some fun stuff too like science experiments or building/making stuff. My 4 year old was everyone, loved everything! His favorite was",
          "Last week we went on an after school field trip to the Houston Children\u2019s Museum with my nephew\u2019s school \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude0d...it was so fun. I even had a chance to ride on a real school bus \ud83d\ude8c...I repeatedly asked my 5 year old nephew are there any phone chargers on the bus, he just stared at",
          "My husband took our 3 year old grandson and he had a wonderful time. There's lots of activities for children all the way up to 11 or 12 years old. His older sister still enjoys going.",
          "We received a family visit on December and they heard nice things about this place. I can\u2019t desctibe how happy their kids were. The museum presents so much fun and they keep chanhing themes which makes the place so interesting. Highly recommended for locals and visitors",
          "We have been taking our grandchildren to the Children's Museum since 2000. My husband and I have lovely memories of taking our 18-month-old granddaughter and the fun she had. She went with us a month ago to take her sister and cousins (3-8). We all had fun! Still a hit is the",
          "Where do I start!? This place was wonderful. There were multiple areas that integrated a wide array of educational experiences. There was a little ropes course, a lab where kids and parents could do science experiments, a \u201ckids town\u201d, an outdoor water area and so much more. My",
          "Took my granddaughter there and she loves it! She goes fairly often with her parents. Lots of hands-on activities set in a \"store\" like atmosphere. A grocery store where the kids can play shopper, or check-out person, or stocker. A restaurant where they can take orders and",

          "Mad house chaos and everything your kids will love doing. Didn't realize how big it was. I think I enjoyed it more than my son. Even for a Saturday it was big enough to not feel over crowded.",
          "This was the first time we had been to the Museum by utilizing Groupon for a decent discount. The museum is a great learning place for both my younger (2+) and older (10) children. I was prepared to have either one of the two not enjoy themselves, say that the museum was too",
          "we visited and would not say it was a bad experience - just that it didn\u2019t really feel like a \u201cmuseum\u201d There were lots of activities, but it felt more like a big play space (think discovery zone) Not a bad place to let our energy - but didn\u2019t find the exhibits all that engaging",
          "We have visited several times during the past year. Each time it is an adventure with my 4 yr old grandson. He is so excited and there is so much to see and do. Cannot wait to go again.",
          "Kids loved it, planned to stay 2 hours, ended up with 4! that means a lot! we went in winter, so there is no water programs to enjoy, however, the other programs still keep them entertained for a long time. they both came back with big excitement!",
          "This is a busy and noisy place filled with children eager to learn! So much to see and experience. MY favorite part was the grocery shopping. Especially for the littles, they get to shop AND check out with the $$ and registers and everything. It is filled with laughter, ooohs",
          "This museum is a gem. They are always updating and adding more activities for kids of all ages to do.",
          "It was super crowded and people seem to think it is acceptable to let children forget manners and general kindness in places like this. My husband and myself didn\u2019t care for it therefore we didn\u2019t stay too long; however, the kids probably could have stayed a little longer (one",
          "This is a world class kids museum with something for every age between 1-100. We spent the entire day there and could have easily spent another full day. If you are a local, a membership is a must. My only complaint is that there needs to be more museum employee supervision to",
          "This is a great, hands-on museum for children of all ages. They have Tot Spot for the little ones (I\u2019d say best ages are 8 months - 4 years) on the 2nd floor. Lots of different things for them to play with and interact with, as well as a small outdoor patio space with a few",
          "My younger kid loved this place. Plenty of hands on activities for kids under 12. Only issue is that parents let their kids roam free and there are very few adult employees to ensure kids are being fair to others. If your kid is well behaved and has good manners, he/she will",
          "My kids LOVE it!! This \"museum\" has activities for kids from 1 to 100 years old. Every visit it has something new to do.",
          "One of the better children's museums we have visited. So many attractions for children of all ages. Our daughter had a blast here during our four plus hour visit and didn't want to leave. Reasonably priced as well.",
          "They accepted reciprocal entrance when we presented our Calgary, Canada science passes- which was AWESOME! My son loved the toddler section and did eventually like the rest of it- although he took some time to warm up to it because it was very loud and overwhelming for him. He",
          "I can't say good enough things about the staff at the Children's Museum. I just had my son's 8th birthday party there and was worried about the chaos since there will be lots of other museum visitors as well. However, Kevonte, our party host was an absolute joy. He explained",
          "This was the best part of our trip to Texas. There was so much for our kids (9,9,6,2) to do. We could have easily spent half of the day here. Parking was conviently located next to the museum. There were many workers cleaning right behind the children. Wish they had a museum",
          "My kids are picky but love this place; love the section where you can act like you have a job in various occupations. Clean, well kept and fun.",
          "Wonderful museum for children . Wide variety of interesting activities for kids. Worth the trip again and again.",
          "I was very impressed with the types of activities designed for the kids. What impresses me even more is the fact that anyone can get in for free every first Sunday of the month with a Bank of America Credit or Debit card. Just show the card and you are in. One card will get one",
          "The museum is fun! You can see that kids enjoy the displays, games, and the challenging games they Offer. Parents, be ready To be in a very crowded space. If you have young kids, keeping an eye on them and keeping in check their enthusiasm is a must. I found that if you have",
          "We took my 15 month old son to the Children's museum and he had a ball. The entire second floor is made for his age group with both an outdoor and indoor space. He was able to roam free and climb, touch, crawl and run to whatever he wanted on this level. On the main level was a",

          "Great minds think alike and the creators of this enclosed children's museum of imaginative wonders is a great place to take elementary age kids for a full morning or afternoon of entertainment. Interactivity is one of the great features as well as a number of things that kids",
          "I admit that I had low expectations the first time I took my children to the Houston Children\u2019s Museum. As we wandered through the place, I felt that place was living down to my expectations. I have no idea how many times we have been to the Houston Children\u2019s Museum since",
          "Great museum with tons of activities for kids & adults of all ages. Lots of interactive things for every interest. Even the food was good at the cafe",
          "This is very nice large interactive children's museum, a lot of variety, lots of stuff going on for kids with different interests and of different ages. One of the better children's museums we've been to. Our daughter definitely enjoyed it!",
          "We had a few days in Houston and a friend with younger children had recommended a stop here. We weren't sure whether there would be enough for our almost 11 year old to do but decided to give it a go. We found plenty of things to keep her interested & occupied, the museum has an",
          "I wish their was two of me on that day we visited. These kids wanted to do their own thing- My nephew did the \" boy\" thing and my niece \"did the \"girl things\" ,but their was only one of me.If you have more than one kid, you need two adults. It was a very interesting place",
          "I\u2019ve lived in Houston for the past 16 years, but being that my kids have long grown out of this type of entertainment I haven\u2019t been here in awhile. However, my 2 year old grandson came to visit, so...wa lah! Here we go! We spent most of our time upstairs in the tot spot",
          "I was a little worried at first that our 1 year old would'nt have anything to do at the museum (he is not walking yet) but then we went upstairs and found the tot spot! He had a blast and could have easily spent hours in there. We cant wait to bring him back when he is walking",
          "We visited the museum on a Thursday evening when it\u2019s free after 5pm. You could spend a full day there and still not see everything! It\u2019s absolutely amazing and the kidtropolis section is incredible. My little one was mesmerised by it all.",
          "I am working near Houston and I took my son to this place and he had a blast, the museum is really nice, it can be tough to find a place to park but once you are in your kids are gonna enjoy for sure",
          "This is a jewel for children of all ages. I brought my children here when little; now a younger relative loves. The \"tot spot\" is a hit for little ones. Try to come when school groups aren't touring and it's less crowded. It can be a bit overwhelming - at least for the",
          "It is the perfect place to spend a day with you little ones. We went there last Thanksgiving Break and it was an awesome experience for our kids. There is a lot to do, so expect to spend 5 to 7 hours at this place. My kids were not ready to leave at all. They have water/ splash",
          "Tons to do for all ages - there was a special place upstairs for my one year old, and downstairs had a ton of stuff for my three year old. I highly recommend a visit here!",
          "Wonderful experience for our grandkids, ages 2, 6, and 8. Everything is hands-on and interactive. Options that are appropriate for the different age levels. Three hours was the right amount of time for their interests and our energy. Definitely worth a season pass.",
          "This place is unique, it has a toddler room upstairs which is a large airy bright space suitable for a child from 1 year onwards. My granddaughter 18 months old spent 2 happy hours trying out all of the toys which are set out in such a brilliant educational way that it\u2019s hard to",
          "This another good children's museum which is effective at teaching children in several areas of science. We will likely revisit.",
          "The museum is absolutely wonderful for the 3-6 year olds on a visual basis and the 9-12 year olds for the participatory activities. I think that it misses the 6-9 year olds a bit, but nonetheless is a winner.",
          "Great fo the kids and last time I went I needed to borrow a kid to get in. Unless they changed. Adults unescorted by a kid could not go.",
          "I have gone with my daughter and grand kids a couple of times. They are 4 and 7. They both always find interesting things to do and see. It is a very interactive place and is well maintained. They love to go here.",
          "I live in Houston and actually have a membership to the museum. My niece and nephews LOVE coming here. There are so many different areas that your kids regardless of age will love it. There is a tot spot on the 3rd floor and kidtroplis / outdoor water area on level 2. Those have",
          "This was our second visit to this museum! Enjoyed it just as much as the first one 3 years ago! There is so much to do! What's great is that almost everything is hands-on and very physical for the kids. Some museums are just all button-pushing, but this one really has kids",
          "What awesome exhibits. We had a wonderful time and lots of fun. We spent two hours climbing and jumping. Definitely entertaining for kids.",
          "An amazing place. Kids absolutely loved it. It has so much to do and see it far outweighs the Colorado one we visited a few days ago. Even has an entire strip for kids to get pretend jobs and make money. Fake atms with bank cards etc and shops for groceries. Definitely worthy of",
          "My sons ages 10 and 7 years old, had a great time! I wasn't sure if my 10 year old would still enjoy this museum, but he had a blast and found plenty to do. Neither really wanted to leave when it came time to leave. I have to admit we didn't explore all parts of the museum as",

          "So much to say about this location. My 9 year old son and even 16 year old daughter enjoyed a half day here. So many activities for the kids to engage in. My wife frequents the Discovery Science Place in Tyler Texas and was able to get us in free today because she has a family",
          "Our personal experience with our 12 year old was somewhat disappointing. There was plenty of activities for younger children. It appears the museum is geared for younger kids. The place was clean, inviting, organized, and spacious however lacking again for preteens. I think the",

          "I went to this Museum when my friends with a baby came to Town for the Holidays. What caught my attention was the fact that you can't enter the Facilities if you are not with an infant which I think is very safe for the kids. So you won't see any adults on their own wandering",
          "Very interactive for kids. Lots of interesting things for them to do and there is a full grocery store where kids can \u201cshop\u201d. Kids love this place. Allow a few hours!",

          "The children's museum is an excellent place to take your kids. The staff is great and there is a lot of things your kids can do. I really recommend this place to anyone that has young kids up to teenagers. It is well worth the trip to the museum.",
          "She couldn't stop moving and exploring. It is best to have an additional adult or older sibling to take video of the toddler's reactions - they are priceless. You will be amazed.",
          "On a recent visit to Houston we went with our granddaughter to the Children\u2019s Museum. We weren\u2019t sure there would be enough to keep her interest as she is a toddler. We found there is plenty for toddlers and older children throughout the museum. What a great way to spend time",

          "I've seen a lot of art museums. This is a good one. We spent five very pleasant hours and saw everything in the regular exhibits. Didn't see any of the \"pay extra\" exhibits, which were probably very good, but had a very good experience.",
          "This museum has one level of fun, in my opinion. The Kidtropolis was great!! It is like a mini-city, just for kids. There is a vet clinic, an ambulance and Police car, a bank, a H-E-B, and much more. There also was a \u2018lab\u2019 where kids 5+ could take part in an experiment. The",
          "I have 3 grandchildren, three girls 7 and under. I dress them all the same and it makes it easier to keep track of them. Its exciting and lots of fun, but going with just one adult can be taxing. I highly recommend the children's museum!",

          "For some reason, other facilities in Houston seem to get more press. But the Children's Museum deserves top billing, in our opinion. Even teens will find something fun to do.",
          "This museum has always been a fun place for kids, however they have definitely updated it since I was little. We took my daughter and niece and they LOVED it, they're about three years apart and BOTH found plenty of things to do together and separately. There are indoor and",

          "Really lovely venue. The tots area ok the top floor is excellent for little ones - there is so much to do. Loved the little houses on the Main Street about different festivals around this time. The how it works section was also really good for little ones. Also the kidopolis was",
          "My 11 and 13 yr olds had a blast and begged to go back the next day. The museum was super busy, but I guess that's to be expected with all they offer. Parking is close and reasonably priced. If you could ever score this on a quiet day, I think it'd be heaven. Glad they have",

          "My kids had fun... which is the number factor. But it was so packed we couldn't really enjoy all of it. You could barely take a step without bumping into someone. The staff was nice, but not overly motivated to help. There is too much to do in one trip. Only because their are",
          "This is the best, or one of the best, kids museums I have ever been too. Puts other cities to shame. Amazing attraction for the kiddos. Lots to put their hands on. Attractions for older kids too. I would recommend to any out of towner. Locals love it too, but once you've",

          "Family nights are Thursdays from 5-8pm. Go. You have nothing to lose! It's a bit crowded, however, there are significant up-sides: 1. if your child has a melt down, leave, @ no cost, 2. closing time forces you out, 3. take your tired child home to bed! The exhibits are varied",
          "We could have easily stayed all day there. My kids are 4 and 9 and had an absolute blast! There were things there for both their age groups and they did not get bored. Everything was decorated for Halloween and the staff were super nice and helpful. This is one of the",
          "I can\u2019t say enough how much my 3 and 5 year old kids loved this place! We intended to go for a couple hours and after 5 hours we still hadn\u2019t even scratched the surface. If we could have stayed 3 hours longer my kids would have done it. They couldn\u2019t get enough.",

          "They offer a secret spy thing for the kids. We paid for one and all three shared it. It was great and kept them entertained for hours. The laser room at the end was the best so persevere, it's worth it. Cool other interactive exhibits. Not your usual museum. If you have young",

They have activities for kids around 2-10 (Older kids are allowed but might not enjoy it that much). My kids really enjoyed coming here when they were younger!",

The best part of the place is the \u2018Kidtropolis\u2019 (a city that replicates what adults do in real life; get to use a fake ATM card to withdraw money, deposit pay cheques and save money. Awesome. Would come again.",

          "This place was amazing! It was my daughter's first time ever going and it has been over a decade since I've visited. It was a wonderful experience for me and her dad! Even though she is only 1yrs old she was able to enjoy a few things in \u2026",

The kidtroplious is the best, the kids kept wanting to go back and play again. It's best to wear shoes and pants otherwise the kid cannot play some of the stuff. We parked free at Hermann park and it's just a short walk away.",

          "The only reason I now dislike this place, and I'm finally posting a review, was because it is WAY CROWDED on Thursdays when it's free. We've been here numerous times on Free Thursdays and it has never felt as crowded as it did last time \u2026",

          "Clean and kept up. Doesn't have a lot of stuff for the very young. It is geared towards 3+ I felt. My daughter is just over a year and could barely reach most of the activities. I was really looking for a place where she could learn and \u2026",
          "We have been a couple times to the Children's Museum, but this last experience was unforgettable. We went on a Thursday with my daughters school, we drove ourselves because I also have a two year old son. If you do not do well with crowds \u2026",
          "I went with a friend and her two elementary age boys and was amazed at all that is offered to kids here! So many fun and educational activities; it kept them entertained for hours. I would NOT recommend coming during a school break. We went during Spring Break and this place was a madhouse; the volume never went below a quiet roar.",
          "Fun for kids and adults. So many interactive exhibits and they even have a toddler only area. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for something to do in the Houston area. It isn't cheap to get into, especially if you have multiple children but it isn't unreasonable either. You also have to pay to park.",

          "One of the best children's museums! So cool and so much to do!! My kids are in the 5-7 age group and absolutely loved it. They have obstacle courses, craft stations, hands on science projects, kidtropolis (mini kid town for them to have jobs and managed their own bank accounts), and cultural exhibits.",

          "There is a LOT to do here. It was crazy busy when we arrived and that made the experience not quite as enjoyable as there were kids of all ages running around everywhere. Chaos is a good description but overall was very fun.",
          "Please at least reserve 3 hours of your day for your kid to play here.  There are so many stimulating activities.  Also YOU HAVE TO BRING EXTRA CLOTHES  FOR THE WATER AREA OUTSIDE. My kid always gets soaked and I end up having to buy expensive clothes from them.",
          "I love this museum I take my 1 & 2 year olds the toddler area is amazing it\u2019s clean and they have a lot of activities. I\u2019ve been going almost every week since my girls love it so much!",

          "Very interactive experience with lots of ways to engage children to use their minds, solve puzzles, develop creativity and learn. It also is a good opportunity to teach in a practical way some real life skills like banking, saving, and working.  It's a great way to get kids away from the electronic devices and have fun.",
          "This place is pretty good for kids but no older kids. They are going not just to have a lot of fun but they are going to learn. if you in Houston this is the place for kids. My kids love seating outside and eating popcorn.",
          "Great museum for the kiddos! Enjoy the different activities. Went on a field trip. The tour guides are friendly and you can tell they also love kids as well.",
          "Our daughter liked this place. There is a toddler play area on the second floor. There are many scientific experiments on the first floor. But it is more suitable for kids above 5th grade. They have a mock bank, ATM, pet clinic, \u2026",
          "This place is really great.  The kiddo loves running around and it's great to interact with other children.  For those who don't know, they have an upstairs for 0-35 months.  Then, there is the ground floor with lots of cool things for kids \u2026",
          "Great museum for kids. I took my 5 year old and 1 year old. If you have food stamps (Lone Star Card Program) you get in free. You have to show proof plus your I.D. We had fun the only downer was there were multiple schools there on a field trip so the museum was very crowded on a weekday. But my kids enjoyed it and had so much fun.",

          "So many multiple areas of active play & interaction for everyday fun! Attended the Chinese New Year celebration w/many extra EASY craft activities and special Lion Dances!! Parking in the garage was quick, organized, & less than $10 for the whole day.",
          "Favorite museum in America! Great bilingual Storytime with donated books. We came two years ago and received a toddler bilingual book (Spanish) and it has changed my perspective of teaching my kids another language. We\u2019ve been here every \u2026",
          "My kids are 2 & 4, and they found plenty to occupy their time interests. We were there when they had different holiday celebrations showcased in home settings. Those were interesting and educational. Each one has a craft, but the supplies \u2026",
          "My kids had an amazing time. So many new additions I had no idea had been added. Definitely worth it!!! We will be visiting more frequently!",
          "Extremely polite and helpful staff very enthusiastic great atmosphere professionally. The kids in the place we're going berserk crazy like it was a daycare center and the people that work there were in charge of their kids. Birthday parties \u2026",
          "I really enjoy bringing the kiddos to the children's museum. Parking is easy (although expensive in my opinion), food is actually pretty good, and they have regular fun events in addition to the exhibits. I spend most of the time in the \u2026",
          "Amazing and lots of fun. If you are looking for somewhere to take the kiddos. It 12 a person/kid. We got there as soon at they opened and stayed until closing there is that much to do! If you want to do the waterworks out side pack a small \u2026",
          "The kids have a blast here and actually are learning and having fun at the same time!",
          "My grandchild and loved it. Kept her entertained for hours. Leaning was so much fun for her at 20months. Prices are great and so are the staff.",
          "This was a really fun place for a 5 year old. We went on a week day and it wasn't busy at all. My child especially loved the climbing tower. It also had a nice outdoor play area.",
          "Great place to take the kids",
          "We went on a Thursday morning and there were several field trip groups but we just tried to move into areas away from them and the 4 kids ages 4-8 that we brought all found activities that they enjoyed.  We take our kids every time we are in the area - once or twice per year.",
          "My family along with a few of our friends went on Sunday. Our 2 year olds highly enjoyed the time spent downstairs as well as the upstairs area in the TOT center. We will definitely return!",
          "Great safe place for children to play. This location has plenty of activities to keep the entire family entertained. Also with every activity comes a chance to lean something new. From the small children using blocks as building materials, \u2026",
          "Loved it. My kid was so happy today.. so many options and its all maintained so well. Thanks to the organizing team.",
          "Kids had a blast!! We were there for 7 hours and still didn't do everything. Best $12 a ticket I've ever spent.",
          "Loved going here this past Thursday! Lots of things for my little baby to do even though he is still under 2, the baby area is a dream for babies! The atmosphere was just so welcoming and overall very enjoyable experience am definitely going to try to make it a regular thing.",
          "Decently priced and has a pretty clean place for kids to be able to run around and have fun. The kids really enjoyed this location it\u2019s really big with a variety of things to do and look at. Wish there was more things for smaller children \u2026",
          "My kids love it! So fun that one day isn\u2019t enough for so many activities. Definitely a year pass is a great option.",
          "Much bigger and more variety than i expected.  My 3yr old son liked everything but would have spent the entire day outside with water toys or downstairs with invention area building rockets and legos.\nBring at least 1 change of clothes and be plan for food.  We easily spent the entire day.",
          "The kids have such a great time here. We went over spring break and it was busy, but not as busy as I expected it to be. We stayed four hours and the kids (and us parents) were totally wiped! Great day activity for the whole family.",
          "Great museum for toddlers. My 3 year old is having a blast. Just don't eat here. For a children's place I was expecting not the best but at least decent pizza or chicken strips. Both were awful. Even the ketchup was a knock off. Lol. For an \u2026",
          "It was super crowded and people seem to think it is acceptable to let children forget manners and general kindness in places like this. My husband and myself didn\u2019t care for it therefore we didn\u2019t stay too long; however, the kids probably \u2026",
          "It is one of the best places for family outings as well as to take kids along.Last week , i went here with my family and the kids in the family had a lot of fun along with learning.\nThe museum has various exhibits clearly depicting the \u2026",
          "Best place for Kids. There are huge amount of activities. One whole day is not sufficient to cover. Worth for the money. Loved this place even for adults",
          "The museum itself is nice but it is a parents nightmare. \n\n1. Way to crowed and not enough room. We spent all that money for the kids to walk around and not be able to do anything. \n\n2. There were attractions where the kids could go inside \u2026",
          "I honestly think we have one of the greatest children's museums in the country. There's stuff for kids of all ages to do, it's easy to navigate and even when it's crowded, there's still plenty of room to play.",
          "This was the first time we had been to the Museum by utilizing Groupon for a decent discount. The museum is a great learning place for both my younger (2+) and older (10) children. I was prepared to have either one of the two not enjoy \u2026",
          "The spy academy is fun and engaging. The exhibits are clean and we'll maintained. And the staff is fantastic!",
          "Huge place. My daughter loved it, I even enjoyed myself. It teaches the children so much in a fun way. I wish there were something like this when I was in grade school, hands on teaching. Just great overall.",
          "Besides the cost it is a very interactive and positive place for kids of all ages. My infant son enjoyed the Tots Lot a whole lot!",
          "This place is amazing! My sister and I took our older kids and the younger kids (13, 11, 10, 3 & 2) They had so much fun they asked to come again the next day! There are so many activities and everything is educational! I highly recommend this place! Plan for a full day because there is so much to do.",
          "Best place for kids. Also fun for kids and parents. Easy way to learn scientific concepts.",
          "Well I went on free family night Thursday. The place was packed which made it difficult to enjoyed . I being to other museum which offer a lot more for toddlers.",
          "Totally wonderful experience. I have a 7, 3, and a 1 year old son. We visited this establishment on 7-23-18 and we had the absolute best time. We were traveling from Louisiana (4 hours away to be exact). Upon arriving we were directed to a \u2026",
          "Lovely place. Great discovery for kids. I feel both my kids learned a lot while having loads of fun. We went during their family night free admission. thank you.",
          "Good clean fun place.  My 8 and 9 year old really loved it.  $12 a person is a great price.  Food court was nice and clean and food was pretty good.  There was staff everywhere cleaning and monitoring stations which was nice.  All the water \u2026",
          "Great level of detail put into all the exhibits. The same exhibit covers a wide spectrum of ages, with different levels of complexity based on development stages. Would certainly go back.",
          "The kids had so much fun. Rooms are divided up and they have an area where you can make stuff with the kids. The parking deck was full so we had to find somewhere else to park a block away.",
          "Everyone had a great time. Was something new to try and there were all sorts of activities to enjoy. Kids played for hours and didn't want to leave.",
          "Not worth the head ache on a Thursday night that's for sure.  The kids love it but parents will be agitated from the huge crowds.  Also not worth the$12 plus on any other night when not family size it's 5plus on any given day.  The kids do love it but it's very stressful for me as a parent.",
          "Fun place to go. Would\u2019ve had more fun if there wouldn\u2019t have been 50 elementary field trips at the same time.",
          "7/19 10:10AM \nToday I lined up at the kidsspot, because I am a member, so I don't need a pass. The lady who checked the pass told me that I had to go back to the entrance to get the pass. I showed my membership card, but she ignored it and \u2026",
          "We gave my daughter a 5th birthday party at the museum and it was fantastic! They were very accommodating to our requests, and Veronica (our designated museum guide) was extremely helpful.  I would absolutely recommend the Children\u2019s Museum of Houston for a birthday party.",
          "Unfortunately it was a very cold day and we did not get to enjoy the outside exhibits.  even then this museum had much more than the children's museum in Portland, which we frequent.  You could easily spend an entire day here, we easily spent 4 hours and the kids were busy the whole time.",
          "There are lots of activities children can do and lots of stuff to learn. Best to take your child when they are 3+ years of age so they can benefit from the learning aspect.",
          "My grandson and I visited here yesterday after not have been in a couple of years. They\u2019ve added a lot of new things for the kids to do and he had a blast! He really enjoyed the dinner and the tight-rope walking. Overall we had a great time!",
          "Excellent place to spend the hot summer indoor. Kids love everything inside. Food is reasonable. The staff is pretty friendly and loves kids. We also came here for birthday party. Location is also closed to good restaurants nearby.",
          "I really love the tot spot for my babies , but I was seeing a lot of kids that look like 3 and 4 in the area too I thought it was strictly for babies?",
          "Awesome place! There's something for children on all ages including the little ones. They keep everything in the baby/toodler area very clean & sanitized.  My older children also love it there.",
          "Kids had so much fun visiting here while in town from Fort Worth. Great experience and staff!",
          "My kids loved this museum. We spent the whole day here and could've spent more time. This is probably the best children's museum we've been to.",
          "Grandkids loved this place!!",
          "Best Children's Museum I have ever been to without a doubt. Water park in the back when the kids wanna just let loose and mom and dad need a break. TONS of activities inside. VERY HANDS ON. Cool lessons. Imax, tours, ever changing displays. \u2026",
          "Easy to spend hours here. Great place for the kids to get some energy out before we get some dinner. Great indoor and outdoor activities. Toddler area is good for kids 2 and under.",
          "Five, five, five!!! There are SO many different stations and places to go! You could easily spend an entire day there, and perhaps then some! I wish I had this when growing up! Fair warning though: it is extremely crowded during weekends and holidays.",
          "This place is great. Only taking a star off for two reasons. 1. The flow is a little confusing and 2. There is a great lack of employee presence and involvement throughout. Perhaps the second is part of why the first exists. I would like to \u2026",
          "Great place, my kids had lots of fun. But one thing parents please keep a real close eye on your children last time I went there we saw a kid unconscious behind a machine by the telephone area and no one seemed to notice him just laying on \u2026",
          "Has tons of things to do for kids to learn and play with. Just come Thursdays 5-8pm when it's free for everyone. Lots of other kids too.",
          "always friendly, but most importantly they keep children interested in different things every time we go. An opportunity to explore different exhibits & LEARN something new-every time is great.  My child never gets bored of coming here. \u2026",
          "Fun for everyone not just kids. The museum has multiple stories so prepare to walk a lot. It was very busy when we went on a Saturday morning but it was still enjoyable :)",
          "Great place for kids. Our family and friends with their families had a blast this weekend. Great place for kids to be kids. Great place for learning and interacting with other kids. Reasonable prices too. Love it.",
          "Love the toddler area upstairs and the water area outside. We seem to get sick every single time we visit though. I have never seen anyone cleaning toys, so they must do it at night and it makes for a lot of germs spreading by the afternoon. But, I suppose that's the risk you take with kids museums.",
          "Our great grandson loved the water part of the museum,  but he liked many other things there.  We will have to come back with him.",
          "Loved it my son had a blast, it was full of kids and buses but we still had a blast. Great place to explore and play.",
          "Eco-friendly and kids friendly places! Educational spot, tiny places but there are more things that our kids can learn or play.",
          "A great place for the whole family. I lived the hands on aspect of the museum my daughter had a blast",
          "Great place to take kids of all ages!  Very clean and well maintained.",
          "This museum is really for ages 7 and up. I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old. The totspot, which is the only area of the museum which is intended for young kids, is only for toddlers under 36 months so we couldn\u2019t go in there since my 4 \u2026",
          "I LOVE IT!!!! I SERIOUSLY WANT TO COME HERE AGAIN!!! YOU CAN COME HERE WHEN YOU ARE BORED!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!! I TOTALLY RECCOMEND IT!!",
          "I really loved this place. Perhaps even more than my son! They say this is for kids, which it obviously is, but there is a lot for the adults too. \n\nThis place is for kids of all ages as they have activities for every age group. The puzzles and tests could seriously test an adult. \n\nI would love to visit it again.",
          "Awesome place with options for every age, even adults in all honesty. Plenty of educational options and tons of activities, including a fairly large area dedicated to building paper airplanes! I mean that should be all it takes to convince everyone this place is the best place. \n\nWill visit again and again as my son gets older.",
          "Children's Park playground is an accessible and inclusive place for children to play and exercise. The park features a poured rubber safety surface, wide ramps.",
          "Absolutely the best museum in Houston for kids of all ages, but especially the younger ones (3-9 years old). One of the better children\u2019s museums in the country.",
          "The children's museum has something for everyone there. Between the outside exhibit, slides, interactive areas, abundance of other kids, free admission on Thursdays, it was a blast. My 9 year old and 2 year old both had the time of their lives.",
          "It has a lot of interesting stuff for kids, I have a 3.5 years old boy and he loved to play in the water and the police simulator place, rather than that, adult people can't find much things to do which make the place not interesting for them and always need to take their kids and leave!",
          "My kids just love this place i\u2019ve had my membership for almost 10 years and they never repeat themselves they always come with something new to interest the kids",
          "Great place for the family. Toddler friendly attractions keep the smaller kids from getting in the way of the bigger kids. Great value on membership.",
          "Such a fun an extensively educational and kids activities rich place! Had my nephew toddlers to visit last week and they extremely enjoyed it! We had a full day and it was not enough to enjoy all three stories with all the different types \u2026",
          "Best place for children play in \nIn doors. You must let them become a secret spy. They will never want to go home. The fresh caffe shop is full of healthy choices. The museum staff is the most helpful and kind group you can find. Love this place.",
          "Great place for the little ones. Honestly its so cool inside i find myself getting involved with the activites. Definitely a spot to hit up during those hot summer months. Parking is convenient as well, just a stone's throw away. Although though its paid parking im sure free parking is available close by.",
          "My grand baby had the time of her life, so she said. It's a wonderland of educational sections, fun mix with learning and hands on activities from entrance to the exit. All the staff there were awesome. Make sure you and your children visit the science experiments with safe chemistry mixtures.  It was amazing. I had a blast too.",
          "This was my daughters first visit to the children\u2019s museum and I was a little disappointed. I\u2019m originally from Indiana and I felt like this was very small and limited compared to to Indiana\u2019s. I love the exhibits they had but they were \u2026",
          "Great place for children ages 6 months old to 7 years old. Educational, interactive, and fun!",
          "They have updated it and my kids LOVED it. Amazing place to make science into digestible pieces for kids.",
          "We used to go to the children's museum in Indianapolis and it was a WORLD CLASS children's museum. Houston's children's museum is also TOP NOTCH. Take your kids. They'll love it. Good rainy day activity or probably awesome to go to when it's 110\u00b0 outside.",
          "Going on Monday morning was nice because there wasn't too many people there. We had a small stumble in the toddler area and everyone was very helpful in aiding my daughter. The tumble didn't slow her down at all, we were able to continue our visit and enjoy the museum.",
          "So much to do and see. My son was very engaged and excited about it all. It was chaotic but that's to be expected with that many kids running around. The cafe had decent prices as well.",
          "Great place to get out with kids and have a good time. Friendly staff and so many activities your kids will have a blast. Definitely will be visiting again when we come back to town!!!",
          "This is a dream place for kids. So many things to do. On Thursdays there is free family evening from 5-8 pm. Toddlers room, lego, climbing place, chemistry, supermarket, art room to draw your masterpiece, public library, and many more!",
          "Lots of fun and learning activities.",
          "Its a great place to keep kids away from tablets and TV. I highly recommend buying annual membership because a day is very less to explore the place. It offers activities of all sorts. My favorite is the two robots that u program yourself.",
          "We love this place but wish it had a little more activities and we were sad that they changed the down stairs. Kids really loved the rope course. Staff was very kind and patient but the staff in the little science creator lab room needs to \u2026",
          "My daughter and her classmates had alot of fun but being that they are kindergartners I feel that it was to advance and they didn't get the full experience... They need to create different age appropriate spaces!!!",
          "My kids really enjoyed it. They had fun with the activities they have there. The food they sell at the cafe is really good and has good flavor.",
          "Outdoor picnic tables eating area shaded but still hot in the middle of summer",
          "Amazing place. My 2 year old son absolutely loved it",
          "My kids and husband love visting on famiily night, only thing is they need new attractions from time to time, and dont take ur family durimg thr summer... To many people=limited fun for the kids or get there very early!!!",
          "Best place to take kids away for a weekend or a day outing , very interactive place for kids , they have a lot of tools and games and puzzles to deal with , It is fun as well as a mind developing process for children. They are just going to love this place.",
          "Kids loved it, we stayed all day! And only did the main floor.  A bit crowded during morning hours with school field trips so go later in the day.",
          "The kids always have a great time, and don't want to leave. If you go in summer, bring a change of clothes and let them have fun, because (some of) the outdoor activities include water.",
          "So many things to do for everyone in the family.  Kidtropolis has gotten a great update.  I love how the city all ties in together.  However I've gone several times and the supermarket is always packed no matter when you go.  It's cause \u2026",
          "It's awesome! Only thing what bothers me is it can get too stressful with too many kids there. Otherwise, so many nice play areas that teach my child one or two things.",
          "This is a great place to bring your kids, you can just basically let them run loose while you just sit back and relax your feet. Very friendly staff with a whole bunch of activities to do, there is even a small City where kids can be \u2026",
          "I stayed for about an hour and half and half that time was spent in the store. I have a 9 month old and the tot area is okay, it\u2019s overcrowded and the items seem a little old. There was an older kid off the side coughing up what sounded \u2026",
          "This was my second time here.  Very fun as always for the kids.  A lot of hands on activities to do with them. It costed around $72 for 2 adults/4 kids with like $10 parking.",
          "Wow!! Kind of expensive but this place is incredible!! My 4 year old loved visiting and getting to play with everything. Learned a lot. You do have to pay for parking and ticket prices are expensive. No outdoor food allowed either.",
          "This place really is amazing for kids. Unlike some of the other entertainment that you can find around the city this is actually an enriching experience. There's so much to do is hard to explain it all in a review. One minute the kids were \u2026",
          "We took the kids here to beat the heat and the kids love it. Our 17 year old still finds things to do. While the 3 year old loves the Water Works section. The staff is aways friendly and helpful.",
          "Need a full day to visit all stations. Our favorite was built your own Rocket.",
          "Great place to take the kids and let them be themselves. I feel like this is an indoor/outdoor playground than a museum.",
          "Kids had a lot of fun when we actually found the rest of the museum. Would recommend",
          "This was a wonderful place to take my 13 month old child on a hot day in Houston. Amazingly, the museum has a dedicated 0-36 month play area that was more than perfect for my child. We spent less time in the other exhibits, but they seemed amazingly engaging \u2014 especially the kid city. We\u2019ll definitely be back to explore more.",
          "My 2 little girls had so much fun! So many great things to do!",
          "The kids really enjoyed their time here. They learned a lot and had fun too !",
          "This is a great place to take the kids. The staff are great, and I really enjoyed my time.",
          "You could easily fill an entire afternoon at this museum. In addition to typical kids museum stuff, there\u2019s a climbing area, a kids metropolis for kids to experience earning and spending money, and even outside area with water activities!",
          "Awesome place for the entire family! Lots of stations to play and activities to do. Mind, body, and soul. Loved the water activities and the aviary.  Live chicks were a plus! I love the money concept were kids get a credit card to earn money with activities and then go to the atm or bank. Love the science area the most! Great staff!",
          "Absolutely great for my little one. Get the year pass and go any time it\u2019s convenient without the pressure to stay.",
          "We love going to the children's museum! We sometimes drive to Houston just to come here!! (We live 2 hours away). The children are always ridiculously excited to come here and there's something for everyone! Seriously, try it out if you haven't yet.your kids won't stop talking about it",
          "The tot spot was great fun for my 2 year old granddaughter. It is for ages birth to 3 years . Love having an area just for younger children!",
          "So much for kids to do, fun learning, great place, well worth he price",
          "Wonderful 0lace lots and lots of things to explore and cheap ... kinda wished they had some hand sanitizing stations but other than that I would recommend for a fun adventure  and it teaches the kids allot of stuff  ...  fun fun",
          "It\u2019s a wonderful children\u2019s museum. We spent around 5 hours in this place. My 4 year old son loved it.",
          "Took my son (two years old) and his cousin (five years old) and there was fun stuff to do for both of them. It's a cute place and it's very interactive. I would suggest waiting during the school year to take younger kids just so there isn't as many older kiddos around.",
          "One of the best children\u2019s museums we\u2019ve been to in the country. Very reasonably priced with lots to do for children of all ages, even little babies! I appreciated how there were workers constantly cleaning the \u201ctot spot\u201d...wiping down \u2026",
          "My kids loved this place.  There are several different rooms and levels for the kids to visit.  Each one has a different set of educational activities.  Building, money, science, etc. Expect to spend 3+ hours here.  Note is can get extremely busy here on the weekends.",
          "Plan for a full day here, because my son didn't get to see everything in a single afternoon. It's a very fun place with a strong interactive focus.",
          "Get there early and find a groupon! would have paid 48$ for a family of 4 paid only 29$ Kids love coming here. Be prepared for fun chaos and big smiles from your kids lots to explore.",
          "Great place for kids.  Lots of hands on activities for ages 3 to teens and even adults like this 70 year old grandfather can join in the fun.  You must go.",
          "My kid has always had a great time at this place except for this last time we visited. We went into the painting room in kidtropolis and I was reaching for a paper for my daughter to paint on when one of the employees stopped me, put her \u2026",
          "One of the best, if not the best, places to go with kids! They learn while having fun.",
          "The museum was great for our toddler. He enjoyed himself very much. The water area outside was a great way for him to play in the water and cool off from this Texas heat. The only downside was parking was pretty difficult as it was very \u2026",
          "Bad experience, cashier was careless and charged us twice. We won\u2019t be back.",
          "This Museum gave my child the best experience that he couldn't forget. Perfect to all family!",
          "Best Museum you can take your kids to. Has a lot of hands on projects for kids and adults to enjoy",
          "Amazing time with the kids and family",
          "We had a birthday party here and kids had so much fun!!! It's a great place, we have membership and my kids love going here...",
          "I wasn't aware that the children would love this Museum so much, they were so excited as they scurried from  each section accommodated for a specific learning experience. The Children's Museum is an educational wonderland!",
          "Visited in April 2018.  Very fun and not busy on the day we went.  It was a weekday.  Spent over 3 hours and still could have down more.  Cost was $12/person regardless of age, so we felt that was reasonably priced. There are a lot of physical activities to do in the museum and a Maker section in the basement.",
          "One of the BEST places you can take a child to satisfy their exploratory self...a well-known gem!",

          "The girls had such a great time at the children's museum. Definitely going back soon!",
          "Lovely museum. Always interesting events. My only complaint is about the officers manning the doors. Officers Jones and Walker are polite gentlemen who always have a pleasant greeting and hold doors for women with strollers. The other \u2026",

          "Excellent place to take the kids to to spend the whole day.  The only thing i dont agree with is family members have to pay a full price to accompany the kids.  They also had us pay for a baby barely 1 year old that was on the stroller almost 90 percent of the time",
          "Best children's Museum I have been to and I have been through a lot you can easily spend 4 hours here. It will however teach your child the ways of capitalism for better or worse",
          "Our family bought the Houston city pass and this was one of the options. Our kids loved this place so much and we had so much fun that the kids wanted to skip the other attractions included in the pass and just go back everyday. We spent about 3hrs here and only left because they closed for the day. It really was our favorite.",
          "Great place to visit with the kiddos. I visited, for the third time, with my grandsons, 8, 7, and 2. You'll need at least 4 hours to enjoy the museum. Remember, the museum is free on Thursdays in the afternoon, check for hours.",

          "Took the kids on a Saturday and it was packed. Even tho it was busy the kids still had a good time. There is plenty to do and lots to learn. I would recommend this during the weekday when it's not so busy. Overall a good family experience.",

          "I know this is a \"children's\" museum, but even I have tons of fun with it. They have a nice area upstairs designated for two and under kids. So even if you have a super little one, you should still go. Lots of sensory stuff to learn and expand their minds.",
          "I love this place! My daughter will be 2 in November and we wanted to try the toddler zone for her and she loved it (our 2nd tine coming, last time she was @6months). I can not wait til she is older for the big kid stuff; there is so many \u2026",

          "Lots of fun for the kids. You could spend days and still not have done everything. We will be going back. At $12 per ticket its not to over priced. My only issue was that the snacks were cash only so we had to leave early because the kids were hungry.",

          "Definitely a place for the kids to both learn and have fun. There are a variety of activities for all age groups. The mock up market place was my kids most fave one. It might typically take a day to look and try out all the activities inside the museum.",
          "My wife, son, and I had a great time there. Will definitely be going back again and again.",
          "My son\u2019s 3rd birthday party was great here and the experience there was great one! Our birthday coordinator was great, I didn\u2019t Really have to do anything because they did it all. Can\u2019t wait to get back for just fun!",

          "My daughter has always loved coming here, but it's always dirty. Such a busy place, maybe they should hire more staff to keep up with the demands of cleanliness. Specifically, the grocery store and tot lot. Otherwise we have a blast and learn alot.",
          "I brought the kids here one weekend while the weather wasn't nice.  All three of us had a great time.  We love all the interactive exhibits and love watching all the kids learn and play.",

          "My kiddos and their cousins love it. My membership gets a lot of use. Only drawback is, the toddler area (Tot Spot) doesn't allow kids over 3, so I can't take by little one there on the same day as my 3 year old.",
          "This place was awesome. There were tons of things for kids to interact with and learning from. The kidtropolis was very educational as well as the builder's lab in the basement. Wish we could have stayed longer.",

          "Great place to bring your kids to, but last time we were there, there was a band playing (a birthday party?) so loud, it was crazy. The band was louder than the racket produced by 1,000 kids. It was unbearable...\n\nIn response to the \u2026",

          "As an adult I enjoyed this place, alot to do for hours great for kids.",
          "I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old and they both had lots of fun. I figured four hours would be plenty of time to get them through the whole museum but I was wrong. almost every room or exhibit had them enthralled and we had to drag them \u2026",
          "It's good for children above 8 years ...my 3 years old daughter didn't enjoy the majority of the games as they were all scientific based made older kids.... so I felt that it was a waste of money in my case.",
          "Mi dos ninos had a blast!  There are little shops and costumes for them to play with.  They can be a banker or a vet.   Great way to spend the day",

          "Went on a sunday with the Bank of America deal, and while it was packed, it was loads of fun.  The kids had a great time, and I think it will be a repeat event.  The kids are 1 and 3, there is something for both.  The only thing to be aware \u2026",

          "Had fun, but could use a few wandering employees to help guide children around if they get separated from their parents. The fish area could use some help being more interesting, and less of a boring spot on the roster. The water area could \u2026",

          "Awesome place for the kids. Tons to do so wear your walking shoes!",
          "Several exhibits need maintenance. There are some fun spots throughout though. I wish there were more staff to help with the interactive exhibits, although we went on a weekday so there may be more on staff on hand on a weekend. My kiddo is 4 and had a great time but I would consider other destinations for older kids.",
          "Great place to spend entire day. Educational visit with lots of interactive activities. We sent about 5 hours and have covered all the areas.",
          "Two stars off because of it's location. It was a fun place to spend time and good education for kids, even teenagers.  The museum is relatively small and overcrowded even on a weekday morning. It's located in downtown Houston which is horrible, costly parking, terrible traffic!!!",

          "We love this place. They have something for every age. And the water works stuff out back is a nice place to cool off on the hot summer day. There is street or garage parking, and it is extremely close to Hermann Park.",

          "There are many very fun things here, but I have just 2 complaints.  \n\n1. The toddler area on the 2nd floor is for kids under 3 only, though several of the activities were more suited to 3 or 4-year-olds than tiny tots.  I have a 1 and 3 \u2026",
          "Beautiful place with all kinds of different centres to engage kids of all ages. My 22 month old and myself along with my friend and her kids equally enjoyed the adult like things in Kidtropolis. The Tiny tots space kept my 22 month old and \u2026",

          "A must see! It is pretty cool specially if you have 3+ year old kids.",
          "The kids were so excited 2nd visit. They went in every station and did every project available.  This place opens thier minds to millions of possibilities. \nThe boomerang project we are still playing with 3 weeks later.",

          "Love this place !!! The kids never get tired of coming here and it appeals to all age group. We decided to visit during spring break and both my 8 and 14 yr old had a blast. They always rotate new and engaging exhibits and labs for the kids.",
          "We love coming to the museum on weekends. Our 3 year old gets to run around trying new things and wearing herself out. Her favorite place is where the chicks and turtles are outside near the water play area(which she loves as well). It is definitely a very fun and stimulating environment for children of all ages!",

        "wiki": "The Holocaust Museum Houston is located in Houston's Museum District, in the U.S. state of Texas. The Holocaust memorial museum is the fourth largest in the U.S., and opened in 1996.\nHolocaust Museum Houston is dedicated to remembering the 6 million Jews and other innocent victims of the Holocaust and honoring the legacy of the survivors. Using the lessons of the Holocaust and other genocides, they teach the dangers of hatred, prejudice and apathy. The museum promotes understanding, remembrance and education with the goal that both students and the general population stay and become aware of the lesson of these tragic events. This lesson is that humankind must strive to live together in peace and harmony.\nA major commitment of the Holocaust Museum Houston is education. The Boniuk Center physically and conceptually houses Holocaust Museum Houston\u2019s Education Department. The physical space holds four classrooms, staff offices, storage rooms and a library. Holocaust Museum Houston Engines of Change Student Ambassador Program introduces Houston-area high school students to Holocaust history and enables them to better understand current issues and to develop their own informed opinions and voices. The Educator in Motion program is a free school and community outreach program that provides educational programming on the Holocaust, Genocide, Social Justice, and Active Citizenship in school and community settings. The Museum, working with colleagues from the Anti-Defamation League Southwest Region, and the Houston Police Department offers training for recruits, in-service and command-level law enforcement officers in this day-long session. Another educational resource the Museum offers are the Digital Curriculum Trunks. Each trunk contains a class set of iPad minis (30 total per trunk).\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nFIRST FLOOR\nMorgan Family Welcome Center\nThe Museum\u2019s patron\u2019s first experience will include entry via the Morgan Family Welcome Center, complete with an orientation film and exhibition materials in both English and Spanish.\nBearing Witness: A Community Remembers\nThe permanent Holocaust Gallery is personalized with testimony of Holocaust Survivors who later settled in the Houston area, featuring artifacts donated by the Survivors, their descendants, liberators, and other collectors. The exhibit also educates visitors about Jewish and non-Jewish resistance efforts, including the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, prisoner revolts, sabotage, the partisan movement, displaced persons camps and life after the Holocaust.\nWorld War II-era Railcar and the 1940s Danish Rescue Boat\nThe fishing boat like those used by Danish fishermen to ferry Jewish neighbors to neutral territory and the World War II-era railcar like the ones that transported Jews to concentration camps and killing centers are intentionally placed next to each other in the permanent Holocaust gallery to help teach visitors the continuing importance of each individual\u2019s responsibility to act when confronted with injustice. As part of the Museum\u2019s expansion, these rare artifacts were brought inside the permanent Holocaust Gallery to protect them from the elements.\nDimensions in Testimony\nUSC Shoah Foundation\u2019s Dimensions in Testimony exhibition, featuring Houston-area Holocaust survivor William J. \u201cBill\u201d Morgan, allows visitors to have \u201cvirtual conversations\u201d with Holocaust survivors by asking questions of their HD projections who then answer in real time via pre-recorded video images. Each specially recorded interview enables viewers to ask questions of the survivor about their life experiences and hear responses in real-time, lifelike conversation. Questions are answered naturally, as if the survivor is in the room, and through AI, the more questions asked the better the technology becomes. Dimensions in Testimony is housed in the permanent Holocaust Gallery.\nHuman Rights Gallery\nThe new Human Rights Gallery will feature educational displays of all UN-recognized genocides as well as tributes to international human rights leaders including Malala Yousafzai and Martin Luther King, Jr. among others. The exhibition encourages visitors to engage with one another, and the outside world, to understand their calling relative to these social ills and the choices that one single person can make to turn the tide and combat hatred and prejudice.\nThe Rhona and Bruce Caress Gallery \u2013 And Still I Write: Young Diarists on War and Genocide\nAnd Still I Write: Young Diarists on War and Genocide highlights the diaries of young people who wrote during war and genocide. The Gallery features six interactive diaries stations with 12 diarist stories rotating between them to educate visitors about the very personal stories of the Holocaust, as well as the existing dangers of hatred, prejudice and apathy. Visitors will be able to access and utilize these electronic diaries, providing them with the unique use of interactive, experiential technology. In addition, the Gallery will include a historical exhibit on Anne Frank.\nTwo Changing Galleries\nThe Museum also includes two changing galleries for art and photography exhibits. The Central Gallery is naturally located in the center of the Museum building. The Josef and Edith Mincberg Gallery is a larger hall for more extensive displays. The changing exhibits are designed to complement and further explore the issues presented in the permanent galleries.\nLack Family Memorial Room\nTwo other areas of Holocaust Museum Houston allow for reflection and meditation. The Lack Family Memorial Room is a quiet place for contemplation. It contains the three-part work of art comprising the Wall of Remembrance, the Wall of Tears and the Wall of Hope. The Memorial Wall is a place where local Holocaust survivors can commemorate their lost loved ones.\nEric Alexander Garden of Hope\nOutside the Memorial Room is a quiet garden known as the Eric Alexander Garden of Hope. It is dedicated to the eternal spirit of children and is in memory of the one and a half million children who lost their lives in the Holocaust.\nSECOND FLOOR\nThe Jerold B. Katz Family Butterfly Loft\nSuspended as if in flight, the Butterfly Loft sculpture is a kaleidoscope of 1,500 butterflies that connects all three floors of the Museum in an organically shaped swarm. Each butterfly represents 1,000 children and together are a memorial to the 1.5 million children who perished in the Holocaust.\nThe Boniuk Center for the Future of Holocaust, Human Rights, and Genocide Studies \u2013 Second Floor\nThe Boniuk Center for the Future of Holocaust, Human Rights and Genocide Studies will provide a research and scholarly forum to consider how to best educate our community and others around the world about the history and memories of the Holocaust. In light of ongoing genocides and issues of human rights, the Center will provide a venue in which to consider values and how our work shapes society\u2019s citizenry. The Center will explicate questions of morality and coexistence as these pertain to human behavior and decision-making.\nSamuel Bak Gallery\nThe Museum will debut the nation's largest gallery of artwork by Holocaust survivor and painter Samuel Bak, with more than 130 works in exhibition rotation. The gallery itself is circular, continuously displaying the exceptional work of the artist while teaching children and adults to apply an understanding of the events of the Holocaust and other genocides to their own lives and respond to them successfully by developing social resiliency.\nTHIRD FLOOR\nThe Boniuk Library\nThe expansion of The Boniuk Library, with more than 10,000 volumes and numerous resources for in-house research and education, allows for enhanced public access to its 285 oral testimonies for research purposes and genealogical searches. The Boniuk Library is one of the largest sources of data in the U.S. for communities that were destroyed occurred during the Holocaust.\n\n\n=== Museum Relocation ===\nHolocaust Museum Houston, Lester and Sue Smith Campus relocated to its new, permanent location in the Houston Museum District in June, 2019 after a $34 million expansion of its original building. By more than doubling in size to a total of 57,000 square feet (5,300 m2), the new facility will rank as the nation's fourth largest Holocaust museum, and is fully bilingual in English and Spanish. The new three-story structure will house a welcome center, four permanent galleries and two changing exhibition galleries, classrooms, research library, caf\u00e9, 200-seat indoor theater and 175-seat outdoor amphitheater. The exhibits now discuss overall history and other genocides. Some items had been temporarily moved to protect them during construction. They were the rescue boat \"Hanne Frank\" and a railcar.\n\n\n== Moral Courage Award ==\nIn 1994, HMH introduced the Lyndon Baines Johnson Moral Courage Award in memory of the 36th president of the United States. Recipients of this award are individuals who, like Johnson, exhibit moral courage, individual responsibility and the willingness to take action against injustice. The 2009 award honored U.S. Sen. John McCain for his heroism in the face of extreme adversity during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistory of the Jews in Houston\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAustrian Holocaust Memorial Service\nHolocaust Museum Houston\nLyndon Baines Johnson Moral Courage Award",

          "A thoughtful museum to learn about the events leading to the Holocaust as well as the horrors, and those who resisted and aided. A lot to absorb. Video on 2nd floor was good if you have energy. Two hours was plenty for us. Museum is well organized for visual and auditory",
          "You will leave this place with an ache in your heart. But it is a must see in order to educate yourself and your well-behaved children over the age of 12 years. Young people of today really don't understand what hate truly is. This museum defines it.",
          "Indeed surreal...it is impossible to try and explain the feeling that one gets from walking thru these hollowed halls. Do yourself a favor and plan a visit.",
          "Being from Amsterdam, The Netherlands myself, this has been a very rough period of time for Europe. Everyone in the world should know what happened exactly and this museum displays this black page in history very well. The human rights exhibit should be taught in school,",
          "We spent an afternoon at the recently modernized Holocaust Museum. Very well done overview of not only what occurred during WWII, but also genocides that have happened more recently. And interesting exhibits on human rights and labor rights. Lots of video and audio of survivors",

          "I lead a group of Active Older Adults and we did a tour of this amazing museum in November. This is such a moving place to visit and I pride myself with knowledge on this piece of history but still came away learning allot more. I highly recommend this as a must see for the",

          "Yes, it reminds us of the evil in man but that is the point. The reality comes to life with pictures and stories of real people who endured this horror, survived, and prospered. Not for young children but definitely somewhere the preteens and teens should go to see how the",

          "I thought this museum was amazing before the renovation. Now that they have finished the expansion and renovation, it is triply amazing! Job well done. This museum has well done exhibits that tell the history of some pretty awful times. It is a good reminder of what not to",

          "I spent 3 hours in this museum. Very emotional and I shed quite a lot of tears for what these people went through. Stunned at how cruel a man could be. Took my breath away. So very sad but a story all needs to know about.",
          "After years of wanting to visit, I finally took a friend from Canada to this museum. We spent over two hours absorbing the exhibits which were presented in simple formats. Although I am not a Jew, i felt the horrors and atrocity suffered by those victims. I couldn\u2019t help but",
          "What a disappointment. I\u2019ve been to the museum before it was enlarged and it was so much better. You can see that today\u2019s political climate had a huge influence on the renovation. It seems many aspects of the holocaust were removed to make the horror of what really happened",

          "This museum is pretty disappointing - there is not much there. Mostly photos hanging on the wall, five to six artifacts in a glass case. 90% of the photographs were reproductions of ones that can be viewed on the internet when the Holocaust is Googled. I am very interested",

          "I had mixed feelings about visiting the museum on a recent business trip, but it was totally worth it. The museum is thoughtful and informative. It is totally worth a few hours of your time. If you know a lot about the Holocaust or know little about it, you will be impressed.",
          "The final touches are taking place but this place is tremendous. The artifacts they have, the story the journey tells and the interactive pieces are world class. The second floor with a fantastic art gallery and educational rooms is really going to be good.",
          "While walking though seeing everything, learning, and feeling the history you cannot help but feel so many emotions. I had to sit a moment while it all hit me. The history books does nothing, when you see and are able to be so close to items and stand inside a train compartment",
          "We were at opening day for the new Holocaust Museum in Houston. It is much better than the previous versions. However the new museum is not yet complete as there were numerous exhibits that were not yet completed. It seems they opened too soon. Give it a few months to get",
          "The museum has been expanded and has intriguing exhibits. There is a humanitarian concept that is wonderful as well as an art exhibit, lecture and film options, library, and hologram of one of the original founders of the museum and a Holocaust survivor.",
          "Recently renovated and just opened back up from their temp location. This is a museum you MUST see. If you\u2019ve been to this location previously or have visited other Holocaust Museums you still should visit this one. There is plenty of interactive technology, pictures, personal",
          "Very nice exhibit, very educational, entrance is free on Sunday, highly recommended. It can be very emotional",
          "If you are remotely interest in the Holocaust you NEED to visit this museum. I was able to actually take a training class here and it was remarkable. I then was taken on a tour that explained each square foot of the building. Even the layout has meaning, the bricks have",
          "My wife and I visited this extraordinary museum and were deeply moved by the exhibits and the history of this inhumanity that the Nazi's brought upon the Jews of Europe. And even still today this same feeling exits throughout several regions of this world. Will we never learn",
          "I think the current location is temporary. Paying 12$ for this place is not worth it. Go on a Sunday when entrance is free",
          "The temporary location was quite a disappointment. While there was some good information it was mostly about individuals that became Houstonians after the war. There were some good pictures and historical information, but it was very limited. I feel a visit to the museum when",
          "I was sad and tearing but if was a part of history that you hear and read about but after seeing the pictures you feel (sad and angry) and I hope everyone feels the same way and never allow it to happen again.",
          "When I visited they were in a temporary space until their full museum renovation is complete. It's a small space but there is still a ton of history that is displayed. The best part was the documentary that was playing. Worth a look!",
          "I've visited many Holocaust museums worldwide, and the top of them were the Yad Vashem in Jerusalem and the one in Warsaw. Most of them are either free to visit or they have a symbolic entrance fee. Charging 12$ for the entrance in a temporary location was something I didn't",
          "When I visited, It was in a temporaty location. That\u00b4s may be why exhibition was so modest. This one, I would not cathegorized as a musseum, but as a poster exhibition/display.",
          "Houston has a very large and diverse Museum District downtown, but the Holocaust Museum is located some distance away. We were able to get relatively close using public transportation, but got soaked in a downpour the remainder of the way! I understand this location to be",
          "12 dollar entrance for adults. A very good and thought provoking museum. Not a huge place, there are several relics and historic artifacts. There are guided tours and a movie room",
          "The museum was in a temporary venue when I visited so I am not sure if all the exhibits were on display. What I found fascinating was that this museum is based on the holocaust survivors who came to live in Houston after being liberated.",
          "Very educational & absolutely a must see. The staff were stern but at least friendly in explaining the rules and such, at the time of this review posting they are missing a few physical objects from the exhibits (the library area was closed as well). Although it's to conserve",
          "A visit to this museum will open your eyes as to what went on during World War II in Germany. Lots of displays and photos as well as guided tour. Tour guides are very informative about the museum.",
          "This museum is very beautiful and educational. Take a walk through history. It is a sad reminder of how human love can fail and prevail. There are authentic items from the the concentration camp to view. Many photos. Paid my respects.",
          "As time goes by and memories fade this is a must, in my opinion, for all high school students to visit and see the horrors that man can inflict upon his fellow man.",
          "This is one of Houston's finest experiences. Trained docents are excellent. The history provided is unique to Houston, as many Holocaust Survivors settled here.",
          "Focusing in the Jewish plight during WWII but it includes other religions, other groups such as Gay's/Lesbians, Elderly, Handicapped peoples who also were persecuted and tortured during this fateful time. It relevant today with current events that have happened with other",
          "Well, treasure has to be understood in its real meaning of something of great value and clarity... this is a very serious place telling an awful story but it is a spiritual center of sorts. Must see",
          "I took my teenage grandsons. They said a guided tour was not available and they didnt have hand help audio so it was just reading pictures. I had gone years before and warned the boys about all the graphic pictures but there were hardly any. Very disappointed. We were in and",
          "As you would expect, a lot of the exhibits here are touching and hard to see. But the museum has done a fabulous job of preserving history so we are reminded of what happens when people who can do something choose to look the other way. This place is so important and so well",
          "We enjoyed the experience (if one can say that about a holocaust museum). It's currently in a temporary location so we're waiting for the completion of the remodel to go again. So check to see if that's been completed.",
          "I guess there\u2019s a temporary location while they build a new one. The temporary one is worth avoiding until they finish their permanent space. Some interesting stories, but nearly zero artifacts. For $12, it felt too pricey. We spent about 30-40 minutes here before finishing up",
          "the museum has relocated because of the recent hurricanes, but the new facility seems adequate for the display. seems to be a lot of offices attached which is ??. our tour guide named Hyman Penn really made this a great stop - his first hand knowledge of the Holocaust was",
          "This museum should have been more in-depth and extensive. We only spent 10 minutes in the museum and that included the restroom break we took. It is literally 3 rooms and the first room is dedicated to promoting homosexuality. Personally, I find the first room offensive. I would",
          "This museum is filled with first-hand accounts, documents and personal effects of those victims that suffered one of the ultimate human tragedies. Very reflective and the experience will stay with you a long time.",
          "We are staying nearby, and it seems to be under construction. I don't know if it is being remodeled or built for the first time, but it is already very striking. The architecture is dramatic and evocative. I will definitely look for it when I return.",
          "This review is for the temporary location on Kirby Dr. The museum has valuable information and you can get a good idea of the holocaust during the second world war in the pictures and articles shown in the exhibition. The museum also has a 20-minute video with interesting",
          "I went to this museum just out of curiousity. Their walk-through exhibit is very interesting and quite emotional - very tragic, what happened in WWII. Good for older kids, but there are graphic photos and a video, so not for younger children. There was an art exhibit there and",
          "We went for a Sunday visit and found it was tiny, no rail car or other things the internet said they had. I was really surprised at how tiny it was, the best part was the old man on video that you could ask questions.",
          "This excellent museum is a must see for everyone. The presentation of a horrific period of history is outstanding. It will help everyone to never forget.",
          "They are under major renovations so the museum is off site in a temporary location. It is small for now. There are the stories about the Holocaust but what I found most interesting were the stories of local residents and their experiences then and now. The video montage of",
          "The history and information that is presented here is a glimpse into a very tragic period in our world! A captivating experience!",
          "I have always been interested in learning more about the Holocaust and what took place. This museum was very informative and the tour guide was very thorough and was able to answer questions without hesitation. I learned a lot while visiting and wouldn\u2019t mind going back.",
          "I had been wanting to go and finally went. I had read and seen lots of movies and books on the Holocaust, but it so different to see the stories being told and see the actual physical items from the Holocaust. Very educational and enjoyable trip.",
          "The Art Circle group for the Holocaust Museum is on roll this year! Tonight we toured two private high-rise residences in Houston to see art collections. At the second residence, they had a young lady who is a third-generation Holocaust survivor play several songs on the harp.",
          "Very well presented/displayed. The horrific stories are there for all of us to learn and remember the truth about what happened. It is important that everyone know, and good to take the time to see this museum.",
          "Although I am not a museum person and I know about the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis during the war I went along to see what this museum had to offer on the subject and came away very moved indeed.The photos, documentation, letters and accounts detailing the inhumane",
          "The original museum is in the process of a major renovation, but that temporary museum is worth the reverent visit. This Sunday afternoon visit was to a fair and unbiased tribute to the human spirit in the face of evil. While the museum in currently under a major restoration,",
          "Excellent! Very educational for all ages. Clean and easy to access. Great photos of the brutal inhumane treatment of those individuals.",
          "My wife and I have been to Holocaust museums around the world and surprisingly, Houston has done as fine a job as any country, including Israel.",
          "It was awesome, we took a group to visit and since we were students they gave us free tickets! The staff was so friendly, it was a great experience.",
          "Not for young children, but teenagers and older would benefit from seeing this place. The exhibits are fairly self-explanatory.",
          "full of history. I really enjoyed coming here. there were a couple people there that i connected with and they knew a lot more then i did. they were very nice.",
          "This is the worst event in history. The museum is definitely a must visit. It illustrated the suffering of many people during this horrific event. Please donate.",
          "Being I have visitied Dachau in Germany, I was surprised there was this museum in Houston. I did learn a few things about history during our visit to this place. It was sobering and eyeopening expierence, although not as impacting as Dachau, but still will leave in impact on",
          "It's been awhile since I have been to this museum but I remember being impressed. Our docent was very knowledgeable and theatrical. When explaining some of the cruelties the guards would inflict he would begin shouting insults at us in flawless German. It made me uncomfortable",
          "A unique experience in prejudice education. You will find it hard to believe the the extent of Holocaust atrocities revealed here. The museum is unique in that it features Holocaust survivors living in Houston.",
          "This museum is very historically informative as well as emotional. It is a great place to learn more about history and to take notes as to not have such evil take place again.",
          "This place is a HUGE slap in the face of reality. I broke down in tears while walking through here, looking at pictures, reading stories of what those people endured. The children...it was just...well, sickening. Don't get me wrong, it's a must see for anyone, just very brutally",
          "Joined a docent tour of the centre and the gentleman really brought the story of the holocost and the link to Houston alive. Reminds us all to remember and not just stand by.",
          "We got a groupon and it was very much worth the visit. Lots to read so make sure you have a few hours. It was extremely sad to read about the stories. But to understand and know what happened during the holocaust, keeps the memory alive of those that died and suffered.",
          "This place is very good. The feeling you get seeing everything brings up lots of emotions. You just cant imagine what these people went through. There is a train car outside also.",
          "No matter how many books I've read or documentaries I've viewed regarding the Holocaust, I am still beyond touched by the pain inflicted on human beings by supposed human beings. The Houston Holocaust Museum charges such a small fee for such a huge display of history. The",
          "Everyone should know our past so not to repeat it. This is the place to go for that kind of knowlege. Please, just don't go smiling in your selfies.",
          "It is a small museum but they are about to expand. The photos and stories are touching and you learn more than you think you know. You get to see real artifacts as well as stand in a car and envision what they went through.",
          "Exhibits and video accounts are enlightening and very moving. Museum is rather small, but a worthwhile experience.",
          "This is a very powerful museum. Probably not too interesting for very young kids, but great for 12 and up, I'd say. It's not huge so it doesn't take a long time to see it all. They've really done an excellent job with this museum.",
          "Not impressed. Not enough to warrant a trip. After visiting the Holocost museum in DC this was a huge letdown",
          "A somber and serious museum with so much information. You can't help but marvel at the human spirit after visiting. There's no hatred here, just hope and inspiration for understanding. The pictures are heartwrenching and I had to pass some exhibits by. I wouldn't take small",
          "The Holocaust Museum in Houston is small but very informative and has excellent exhibits. It is second only to the one in DC. Everyone should visit this museum. History forgotten is history repeated.",
          "Easily accessed, only a couple weeks f blocks from the Museum Center stop on the red line. Several other museums in the area.",
          "Even if you have a casual interest in history, this museum is a must-see. The displays and interpretive information give a lot of detail; there was even information about what Holocaust survivors went through after they were freed. Don't miss the train car and the memorial",
          "Wow. I don't know how else to describe the Holocaust Museum. When I was maybe 9 years old, my parents organized a church trip with a class they taught and we got to tag along. I have loved visiting this place ever since. It changed my life. Throughout grade school every one",
          "The museum is excellent with a good mix of Holocaust history and specialized exhibits. Before entering the museum, do not skip past the large permanent exhibit identifying Jewish communities destroyed during the Holocaust. As we had been to other Holocaust museums, we started",
          "Not much to see here. Very similar to the numerous other such places that abound all over. Been there done that. Better use of time elsewhere.",
          "Very educational. I've been to other holocaust museums and they have more going on. Like showing you how they lived while in hiding. Rooms like the gas chamber.They more interactive features then this museum.",
          "A must see museum. Although it was quite sad to relive this era, everyone should experience all the information this museum has to offer. Well organized and it will take you two to three hours to see everything, especially if you read everything and watch the film.",
          "The museum was nicely set up but expensive to be a museum \"culture\" which should be at everybody's reach. Still worth while going to visit if you're into History and WWII.",
          "An informative and at the same time sobering look at the Holocaust, well worth the visit to this compact but well laid out exhibit.",
          "As the title says. You have to see it, so you can really appreciate the gift of life. This people suffered in a way no one can imagine, that it makes you wonder how lucky you are in the life you're living. There's a projection of a survivor in a dark room that you can ask him",
          "As you drive up to the museum you see the recreated smoke stacks and wire fence to remind us of what a concentration camp looked liked.",
          "I think that place was the best place in Houston I've ever seen, it has a lot of original stuff and also that place showed to me why we have to destroy the nationalism.",
          "The museum may not be great for the really young. But for 12+ and adults it presents the facts in a well organized manner with items from that time and place. Don't be in a rush and read everything.",
          "I have been living in Houston for 20 years and I just now made it, I'm slightly disappointed it took me this long. The museum is small, but packed with information. We took the tour given every hour or so, our docent was amazing, he took his time and was very knowledgeable.",
          "We were especially moved by the butterfly exhibit, where a butterfly was made in memory of a child that perished in the Holocaust. Too many children perished.",
          "Being Jewish, this is a great piece of history. I really enjoyed seeing the exhibits and some of the facts about the Holocaust. It's a must see place if you're in the Houston Area",
          "the docents on weekends are so knowledgeable and effective. It is a small museum but definitely worth the entry price. You will learn so much but leave with a hole in your heart. I've recently taken 3 sets of guests to the museum and they all give it high marks. I learn",
          "There really isn't any venue in Houston more moving and thought provoking than the Holocaust Museum. Local Holocaust survivors are profiled and the reminder of man' inhumanity to man is clear and vivid. While dedicated to seeing such atrocities won't happen again we live in a",
          "Place is well taken care of, I have been in some other museums and this is average, good story telling and pictures speak more than words, it is depressing how the Nazi's took advantage of people and killed so many, not for young kids.",
          "The exhibits were outstanding! We\u2019ve been to several holocaust museums in the U.S. and in Europe, and this was one of the best. Very few mementoes of the camps but the photos were spell-binding. Photographic history from early Jewish community life to Hitler\u2019s rise to",
          "This museum is much larger on the inside than it looks on the outside. I have been to a few others in various cities and Israel. This one offers a great afternoon of rich history that will move your heart. Great for all ages.",
          "I found this museum extremely informative and interesting. I've been several times for museum, movies, and exhibitions! I love it all of the events. It's very informative for school groups as well.",
          "This museum packs a lot of heart wrenching facts into a smaller than usual museum. What can be said other than this should never have been able to take place. The absolute destruction of human life is unimaginable! While you wipe away tears you can't help but feel the swelling",
          "How do you describe such a time as this in world history? Very moving, hard to see in places. Very young children might not understand. My 11 year old granddaughter had a difficult time with it. But, it was good that we could talk about what happened & she came to an",
          "Be ready to cry when visiting here. The presentation is wonderful but the sadness in seeing this all really happened is pretty overwhelming.",
          "This is much smaller, but has many interesting, sobering stories and displays, plus a movie at the end of several survivors. Very unique exterior memorabilia as well, the stack is a very striking and chilling. I highly recommend this exhibit",
          "I visited the museum with my family in February 2017. Parking is free, and there are discounted tickets for students and seniors. The museum takes you through a history of the Holocaust, paying special attention to the Houston connection. There are some very difficult images,",
          "A close friend and I spent a few hours here. It was interesting to see the way the museum portrays the past. It is a heart wrenching story but must be told. It is done tastefully and with respect. The photos and artifacts shared certainly bring home the cruelty of the",
          "We went with my students and the tour guide was extremely knowledgeable. There\u00b4s a train car to visit outside, and a memorial that\u00b4s a must-see.",
          "This visit was very sobering when you realize the persecution suffered simply because of one's race/belief. I recommend either a guided tour or they also have a cellphone audio tour that I didn't know about until I had already walked through. I learned some things that I did not",
          "this is a great place to take the kids to learn a little bit of history its sad looking at some of the picture but a great experience",
          "I was very taken back by what I saw. I learned about the concentration camps in school, but nothing can prepare you for what you learn in the Museum. I recommend it to everyone. It will educate you on the the real evils of this world.",
          "The Holocaust Memorial Museum of Houston is a brilliant expose' of photos, film footage, and reproductions of the most disturbing tragedy of the 20th Century. It shares the timeline from the early days of the Nazis rise to power to their fall bringing the culmination of that",
          "We decided to walk through the museum on our own. I left with such a heavy heart. I would recommend the exhibit if you're ever in the Houston area. Bring Kleenex.",
          "We knew from the history books how bad this event was but until we visited we could not comprehend the enormity of it all. The stories and the pictures shown really effected us. Amy was our docent and she was excellent. Our tour was 1 hour and 45 minutes long. It was a large",
          "Good location. Have been to other similar museums and this one met our expectations. Good overview of nazism and the holocaust with Houston connections. Friendly and helpful staff. Recignized some of the pictures which are also displayed in Auschwitz and Berlin. Necessary",
          "The Holocaust Museum Houston is extremely well curated and very compelling. I have been to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC twice, and in visiting the Houston museum, came away with having learned new information and a different perspective. The new exhibit, the Pinchas",
          "I'm a history buff and our son is now learning about this subject in school. Perfect, so I informed him about the museum will be a great opportunity to obtain more information through another resource. He thoroughly enjoyed the museum and did get better understanding of what",
          "We like this small Holocaust museum in the central Houston but think the Holocaust museum in DC is far superior than this one. The museum offers a small pack of information and exhibits regarding the Holocaust during WWII. The presentation is average but we love its 30-min",
          "I have visited several museums across the country, but never did it occur to me to visit the Holocaust Museum. In a way, I was afraid of hearing and seeing what Jewish had to go through during that catastrophic event. However, I made the decision to go and have the experience. I",
          "Always interesting to learn about what the Holocaust did to the world. Sad that it ever existed. Museum was interesting, however, not as good as the one in Washington DC. The Pinchas exhibit was amazing. Took about 2 hours.",
          "Come to Houston to share and experience what hate was and to help stop and get rid of hate. The museum teaches tolorance to one and all. Has programs for people of all ages. Would highly recommend for everyone",
          "The building is easy to access and always has more than one thought provoking exhibits. The selection of books are interesting as well. There is an outdoor train to experience seeing the inside of the \"cattle cars \" of Germany",
          "This museum helps to remind of what has happened in the past and even what is happening still today. A really sobering insight to \"Man Inhumanity\" This museum will help future generations realize the full effects of racism and bigotry. We must insure this never happens again!",
          "I have never been to a Holocaust Museum before. I assumed that it would have just a few stories, but boy was I wrong. This museum has not only stories, but pictures, videos, hands on exhibits and much, much more. We took my mother-in-law and she was moved to tears. We all",
          "Not overwhelming but factual and effective, sobering. Wasn't aware there were so many survivors that settled in Houston.",
          "Didn't know what to expect when I took my daughter to the exhibit. I found a great deal on Groupon and she has been interested in going since they learned about the Holocaust in school. They didn't teach much to my knowledge in school when I was younger but we got a huge lesson",
          "This is one of the best Holocaust Museums I have been to, all are necessary and informative. This one was extra special. They have a film of local people who survived the holocaust and their stories. The boxcar is there as well, but also a boat that helped transport Jewish",
          "The Holocaust Museum is a city treasure. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit despite it being so jarring. The displays are well organized and nicely presented. The staff is also very helpful. A must if you have a couple of hours.",
          "It was a very emotional trip. Learned alot about the people that existed back then and the way they was treated. Now I truly understand the star of David. Would like to take my kids there one day.",
          "I liked it. There were lots of information to know about the Jews in Europe and Nazi's existence at that time.",
          "The tour was good , very informative for visitor from out of town. May use a little more sculpture outside building.",
          "IT is not as big or in detail as the Museum in washington but you can get a Docent led tour which adds to the experience. Shows what can happen if hatred, apathy are allowed to grow",
          "My family and I decided to check out the museum Saturday morning. It was very informative and moving visit. I was brought to tears and really enjoyed the visit. Many Houston area survivors spoke in a video.",
          "I came across this museum by chance while walking in the area and am so glad I did. The story of the holocaust is well told through historical facts interweaved with personal stories of those affected by the tragedy. It was informative but more importantly moving. The staff",
          "We did not know what to expect, but there were survivors there that explained what we were seeing. I learned so much and the experience really moved the entire family. It makes you feel truly blessed for what you have",
          "I just didn't know how a Holocaust museum in Houston would be. However, it was a very respectful museum that doesn't allow pictures on the inside and flows you through the history with a perspective from Jewish houstonians tied to the holocaust. It leaves you feeling somber but",
          "The Holocaust Museum is near the Museum of Natural Science. The museum provides a history of antisemitism and the events that occurred during World War II. There is a gallery that has some interesting paintings. If you don\u2019t decide see the film at the end of the museum you",
          "I've visited a number of Holocaust Museums in Europe and the USA, and I have to admit surprise at finding such a good museum in Houston. It commemorates the Holocaust via survivors who are (or were) Houston residents and does it thoroughly and without fanfare. Guides provide",
          "A very well laid out museum. Very educational excellent for all ages. A very emotional visit, well done.",
          "Houston isn't the first city at comes to mind when considering he Holocaust or anything related to Jewish history. This museum is very well organized. It has a lot of exhibits and text related to those exhibits, but it really drives home the message with the photos, especially",
          "This was an impressive museum to visit. I took my 3 sons and the artifacts and media presentations gave a respectful yet solemn experience to dive into. I would not recommend to younger children as many of the pictures are graphic and disturbing (as they should be). The city of",
          "Very well presented history of anti-antisemitism through history, not just during the WWII Holocaust.",
          "If you have never been to a Holocaust Museum and are in Houston, take the time to visit this one. It is a tribute to all the Houston families that were part of the Holocaust and those who survived. It is very inspiring. They have a Butterfly display that is a tribute to the 1.5",
          "I felt this was just ok, but I am also comparing it to the one I saw in DC which I felt was phenomenal. This museum had mainly photographs and some video clips from the era, and a few actual artifacts. the theatre room has a looped video interviewing actual survivors - that",
          "Take the guided tour. Allow time to brouse gift & book selections for purchase. This holocaust museum is second only to the one in New York! Educational, emotional and inexpensive.",
          "This museum, given the content, is very sobering. It really is a beautiful tribute to the victims of the genocide during the Holocaust. I will say the main exhibit is a lot of reading, but I learned many new interesting facts and stories. It is a beautiful museum that will",
          "Thoughtful, informative exhibits. Haunting, with hope filled messages for the future, I alternately felt sadness and helplessness. An important museum to visit",
          "This museum was a must see. Off the beaten trail of other activities, but once you find it, it's worth the visit. Saw/heard videos in the auditorium (like a movie/documentary) of the survivors. Was very moving, telling. At times brought tears to your eyes, but is a story",
          "This is such a sad story. It is well worth going to see it. We have only been once but recommend everyone to go.",
          "I thought it was just ok. There is a self guided audio tour that was good, but I thought the exhibits were just ok. The exhibits were mainly photographs and seemed to only focus on Jewish victims and almost completely almost entirely ignored other groups that suffered.",
          "What a wonderful experience. I truly thought I new about the holocaust when I actually only knew so little. It is a sad place remembering all those that were lost, but so glad I came.",
          "Well done presentation of video and photography. In my opinion the museum displayed a very limited number of artifacts, which is a primary reason to go to the museum. However, be sure to not pass by the outside exhibits which includes the railcar. Also, not being from Houston,",
          "As with any museum associated with the horrific realities of the holocaust (we've visited some in Europe as well), this exhibit is a soulful, somber experience. It is also a sobering reminder of the fact that humans all to often continue down this gruesome path and of the watch",
          "Small but powerful. Plenty to read. More pictures and literature than items but that's enough. The pictures are haunting. Park is tricky in the museum district.",
          "The museum is about telling the story of the families and children. Remembering them is honoring them. Obviously the subject matter difficult to look at, but so important to remember. It stays with you in a way that changes your heart and the way you look at the world....",
          "We have visited many Holocaust museums (including the Auschwitz camps in Poland) so we are always interested in seeing how different museums convey the message. We were still able to learn new information from the Houston Holocaust Museum and thought they did a nice job with the",
          "Not wanting to join in with the tour group, we entered and began reading right behind the tour group. The guide was so very mesmerizing, we joined in. He captured the attention of the kids, teens, and adults alike. Having taught about the Holocaust and met a survivor and many",
          "Enjoyed learning about the Texas connection to the Holocaust. Museum is well curated and located in a good area near other museums. Highly recommend taking the time to visit this museum.",
          "I know that when it comes to the holocaust you tend to think about Jewish genocide but there were more people other than Jewish who also suffered at the hands of the nazi regime, some of them because didn't support the government because they knew they will be killing people of",
          "We spent an hour and a half at the Museum which was adequate to fully capture the main exhibit and the three special exhibits. We have visited the Wash DC Holocaust museum and this museum is on a much smaller scale but well worth visiting. The museum emphasizes the Houston and",
          "One of the most moving exhibits I have seen. Even though my family wasn't part of the Holocaust, we lost many members of our family in Europe during WW11.",
          "something everyone should go to, our children need to see this, everyone very friendly , real close to the other museums and train ,",
          "Visited in wheelchair. Could not find staff on any of the floors to direct towards bathroom or water. No signs available at all . After going in circles, returned to first floor only to be told again in automaton voice \"there are bathrooms and water fountains on every floor\".",
          "I went with a friend not knowing what to expect. the horror of what happened was documented so well and we wept with sadness over the atrocities that took place.",
          "having both of my parents as survivors of the Holocaust the museum is a place of reflection - i'll never know what it was truly like for them to be in Auschwitz but coming here allows me a chance to try to better understand the horrors they suffered at the hands of the Nazi's",
          "Such a somber time in the world but the museum presents the history in such a dignified and personal way. Very worth it.",
          "This is an amazing place to visit and has much history of the Holocaust.The short video at the end is very informative.",
          "Great time with my girlfriend who is into history. Everyone who cares about history must check this place out at least once in their lives. Nothing bad to say at all. Can get busy at times and staff does great providing information.",
          "We went expecting an emotional trip and it definitely didn't lack that. The guided tour offered a lot of information that I did not know. The museum has artifacts as well as photos. It is very well put together and and worth the trip. Just make sure to bring tissues.",
          "It wasn't a bad experience...We just expected a bit more for the admission price. Mostly photos, and a few items for viewing. We really liked the survivor interviews...it was nice to have an area to sit down, since it was a lengthy video.",
          "Get there early. I arrived at 2 and was rushed thru. Security guard was rude and pushed ppl out before closing. She only cared about going home. The multiple exhibits shows the history via photos, letters, written records, movies etc of holocaust including bonefish victims. Very",
          "This museum will take an hour of your time to visit if you take a guided tour. it's well worth having the guide take you through the museum. Details of the Holocaust are well explained without sensationalizing them. the facts alone are powerful enough.",
          "There is no way to imagine the horror of the Holocaust. The museum gives you a glimpse of what it must have been like. When you see the list of survivors near the end remember, some of those people are our fellow Houstonians. This is a very candid look at one of the biggest",
          "I spent several hours at the Houston Holocaust Museum located on Caroline Street. The displays, pictures and stories located throughout this museum remind us of how we should not be towards other human beings. You find yourself asking, \u201cHow could we let things get so far out of",

          "The museum is well organized and displays are well done. Staff is very helpful. Takes about an hour, but is really worth the time. Check out the perimeter of the building with the tiles and display.",
          "My family - myself, wife, two sons (ages 18 and 22), and my 79 year old mother, visited the Houston Holocaust Museum while on a two week tour of Texas. I have previously visited Holocaust Museums in Detroit and Richmond, VA. While this museum is much smaller than the other",
          "I was totally amazed with this collection or exhibits at this museum. The story chronologically takes you from Hitler taking over the power to the scariest stories of the 20th century. This is a must see place for all visitors in Houston.",
          "It's definitely worth taking the time to visit the Holocaust Museum. I've been multiple times, and with each visit I learn something new. A very difficult museum given the subject matter, but important to understand and remember this time in history. Ask if there is a docent",
          "Amazing collection for such a small museum. I joined as a member, and I had access to their library which is impressive. There are always interesting exhibitions which are perfectly curated. A definite must-visit, albeit somber material; it is important to learn of the tragedy",
          "A must visit for EVERYONE! To know our history as humans, all must be aware of the travesty our ancestors of human life experienced whether related or not. Each and every culture, race, gender, and so forth has suffered, yet those who survive with grace are those we shall",
          "The Holocaust museum was done well, but not excellent. The walk through exhibit was interesting and informative. They have a free audio tour you can use through your cellphone, so I would recommend bringing headphones. If you walk through the exhibit w/o the audio tour, you",
          "Beautiful and well developed museum Perfect for kids and teenagers Has a wonderful staff And a great way to visualize such an important history My family loved it We learned a lot Thank you so much",
          "I am a very sensitive person, I have to be aware of presentation of materials of this nature, because I can become extremely upset. The Holocaust Museum presents all their photos and articles to read as you walk through the museum in a very factual format. It is extremely well",
          "This is a good theme to make people understand about tolerance and empathy between races, it has history but lacks of something to make it going beyond. It is interesting visit but.. it will not make to change your mind.",
          "This place has tons of information about thongs I could really care less about. But, ironically I found interest in a lot of it. Good place, but not for children and would be better to actually know a little about the Holocaust before visiting.",
          "My husband and I enjoyed this museum. There were a lot of good pictures and artifacts. We learned a few things we didn't know before. A lot of good information connecting Houstonian survivors. We brought a 15 yr old and a 12 yr old with us. Both have learned about the Holocaust",
          "Very sad and humbling, but informative. Actual books, memorabilia, etc. You can't take pictures in there though (my guess is out of respect). Videos with ACTUAL footage with leave you in tears! There is a movie theatre room, with actual survivor stories that give you chills, but",
          "One of the most complete collection of Holocaust objects I have seen housed in a very nicely designed building. Impressive and interesting!",
          "I've taken my older grandchildren here as soon as they were old enough to express an interest in learning about The Holocaust. Not suitable for young children (<12) - it helps if the kids have a basic understanding of The Holocaust. I watched \"Schindler's List with them before",
          "This is a very unique place. I went there to listen to the stories of a holocaust survivor. Nice and informative displays and photographs of the trials, suffering and tribulations of the Jewish community in WW2. There are stones outside that represent the concentration yard",
          "This is a lovely museum with a nice layout and interesting exterior, which should be studied. Two of us visited last week, and spent half our time watching the very good film. There was not enough time before closing to review even the main exhibit, let alone see the two",
          "Wow! This was a very detailed an informative display about Jewish life before, during and after the Holocaust. There was a detailed video from Holocaust survivors, many photos, documents and detailed information about life experience throughout Europe. Artist Samuel Baku, a",
          "With the \"never again\" mantra hanging over everything you see and do here, the museum is a great way to pay tribute to those who suffered and died under unthinkable oppression. The care and respect used when handling the retelling of the survivors' stories is appreciated.",
          "This is one of those places that brings history to life. Unfortunately, the history itself is very uncomfortable (one might say sickening.) Having said that, the Holocaust Museum does a great job of telling the stories of so many people that were lost in the Holocaust as well",
          "The museum itself is great and very informative. We went on a free Thursday afternoon which is from 2-5. We arrived at 1:30 and waited for free hours. Well by 2pm there was approximately 40 people waiting to get in and they put us in one big tour group. The museum is so small",
          "This museum not only has a ton of photos from this point of time but also has an enormous amount of the glasses that were worn from the Jews and taken by Hitler's army, a box train whereas the Jews were huddled together for transport (we were allowed to go inside) and the tour",
          "Located in Museum District, this must see museum is near many other interesting places to visit. Your emotional journey starts outside with a sloping wall leading up to what reminded me of a chimney. listed are dozens of towns and cities in which the Jewish population was",
          "I took my mom to this museum on one of her visits. The museum is pretty large and there are so many artifacts that it's very easy to overlook a lot of items. We started with a guided tour; however, it was a pretty large group and it was difficult to hear the guide and many",
          "I heard about the place and wanted to see it. It's rather small but very interesting. Nice architecture too.",
          "This was a wonderful afternoon activity within the famous Museum District of Houston. It was well laid out with a movie and lots of pictures and artifacts as well. Time well spent!",
          "This was a fanatic place to get a great history lesson. Students are free so there is no reason to not bring your children. The memorial is simply gorgeous. The information is might be a little saddening or disturbing for younger children....but history is essential.",
          "What made this good was our tour guide, she had family that perished and family that survived this dark period in world history. She was very passionate about the museum and the history. There are important artifacts and photographs that we as a society must remember to prevent",
          "This is actually not a bad museum with free parking and reasonable entry fee. Most of the displays are quite accurate. However, the docent was an old man with many inaccurate details to tell. The sad part is that the group was mostly high school kids who could not filter his",
          "I found this museum to be small as far as size. However, though small, every inch of this place is filled with context. You'll find photos hanging on every inch of the walls, and there's also a film room where one can watch testimonials from Holocaust's survivors.",
          "A carefully illustrated and displayed museum with events, people, pictures and objects of our shameful past. There is one large gallery to the right with 3 different sections that has even videos of Hitler and the victims. To the right, there is one joyful collection of",
          "From the architecture to the amazing amount of donated memorabilia, this was an amazing museum. Out docent was the daughter in law of a survivor and was excellent as well. Take time to watch the movie!",
          "This is a good museum but can't compare to the ones in Europe. I did enjoy it and the movie is very thorough. Worth the trip.",
          "I enjoyed the visit but it was missing something. It was very cold and not any interaction with employees or volunteers. I believe it is important that everyone know what transpired and how it transpired. Any visit to a holocaust museum is expected to be sad although I think it",
          "We went with a group of middle school youth. They were fairly interested. The exhibits were very well presented and I learned some new stuff. I was able to talk to some of them and show them Dachau on the map - a place that I have visited. I was pretty impressed with the",
          "Do take one of the scheduled (hourly?) free tours. It adds so much to the visit. Our docent was very articulate and informative, and we wouldn't have gotten nearly as much out of the visit without the guided tour. It makes you realize how something so terrible can happen, and",
          "We came here after a morning spent at the Natural History Museum located only a few blocks away. We walked down from the Natural History Museum - as you never know how parking may be - but we ended up not having to worry about that as parking at the Holocaust Museum is free.",
          "Nice place to take your family if you want to know more about the holocaust. Very informative while using lots of visuals. I can't escape tears when I visit. However, my 6 year old wasn't quite ready for this lesson. It didn't peak her interest but she was upset after seeing how",
          "I have made the Holocaust Museum Houston one of my stops on nearly every trip to Houston. The exhibits within take you into the lives and times during the Holocaust. It is very respectful to those who lived through and perished during the Holocaust.",
          "Excellent display. May not be the largest Holocaust Museum but it grows every year and worth a trip every year. Always something new.",
          "This is a must see for everyone! It's haunting. Very well set up and easy to learn about this horrid time.",
          "Tour guide was amazing! Watched Schindler's list as a teenager for an ethnic studies class and have been interested in learning more about the holocaust every since. Was very excited when planning my vacation and realized that Houston had a museum because the National one in",
          "I came across this museum few weeks ago, the word \"Holocaust\" made me wandering with my complicated feeling. I know I sure will learn something, and also it will overwhelm me. It needs courage and bravery to walk into a timeline which full of tragedy. I made it today, and highly",
          "On Thursday, special time and fees are available. It is most thorough in the history they tell for this period in World History. All on one level and easy to read notations through out the displays. The visuals are easy to interpret to understand the tragedy. Outside is a",
          "Recently had my first visit to the museum and can't believe that it has taken me so long. The experience was sobering; uplifting and thoughtful. Depending upon how much time that you have, you can run through it quickly or really take the time to absorb the resources provided. I",
          "A great reminder of the worst of human kind. Many societies, including ours, could slip into this one day if we are not reminded of the horrors of the holocaust. This isn't the type of museum you feel good about going to, but I'm glad I visited. I missed the tour, but did",
          "I took a taxi from the Omni Hotel which cost $50. (The taxi's here accept cash or cards). The ticket price is $13. There is a 30 minute film to watch then a walk round of the museum. I didn't do the tour but was told I could download the app to listen to each station.",

          "I love history, period, so I was really excited to visit the museum. Having never been to a Holocaust Museum, I have nothing to compare this visit with. The architect built this place with sentiment and symbolism. The quotes along the inside and outside of the building make the",

          "I visited this attraction in a family trip. We really enjoyed to learn more about history details. So, this is a really nice place to know more about the history of the holocaust and how people were connected to the states. I highly recommend this cultural attraction.",
          "I went to visit here after going to the Bicycle Museum as they are very close by. If you get a chance you should visit here. Be warned the pictures shown are very graphic but they need to be. There is a film to shown which gives the stories of survivors which is definitely",
          "I really hated going here. I'm not good with emotionally tragic history. I cried, I was angry and disgusted at what humans can do. I wanted my kids to see what can happen if you just conform to one persons ideology. Also why I took them to see sound of music, but that's another",

          "Had a chance to go to the Museum while in Houston for a long weekend with my 12 year old son. He studied the Holocaust last year and specifically read Number the Stars. We were greeted by a gentleman who explained the layout of the museum and what we would be seeing in each",
          "I went with my daughter for a school assignment and found it to be excellent. My 13 year old was engaged and learned a lot. You will come out feeling sad but I think it's a good experience and well worth visiting to teach everyone about the holocaust. The museum isn't",
          "Had Family visit from out of state for a short 5 days. Had a wonderful time site seeing and of course we made to the Holocaust Museum. Very informative, great staff. Clean well organized. Not expensive and good selection of souvenirs.",

          "My wife and I have visited the Holocaust Museam in Washington DC. Both of us feel that the one in Houston is as good, and in many ways different and better. This museam deals with the lives of family members of the citizens of Houston. This museam uses photographs to tell the",
          "We arrived there an hour before it closed, so we did not have much time to read everything. But turned out we finished walking around all the exhibits. When you have a visit in Houston, getting into a serious topic like Holocaust is a very different experience. My younger boy",
          "A beautiful and fitting tribute to the millions lost during the Holocaust. The guide was very knowledgeable, this is a must for all to see.",
          "This museum is appropriate for teenager +. Due to the chains and live size figures in cages I would not take small children. It really opens your eyes and hearts to those who endured slavery. And realize we have come along way.",
          "We spent a Saturday afternoon at this museum and went through only a portion of the displays. I knew much of the history, but this was more. This was personal experience brought from many people. I had taken for granted that my children woukd have been somewhat exposed to this",

          "I have visited three times and each time I come away with a heavy heart for what mankind has done to themselves. It is very informative and has many actual items from the Holocaust. For those interested in history it is a must see.",
          "Lots of pictures & videos Very informative and moving. This plays on many emotions and you walk out somewhat numb. The final phase is the liberation and it leaves you feeling a bit better that some were rescued from the hell they were put through.",
          "I have always wanted to go to this museum and I'm so glad I did! It was very informative and heart wrenching. You don't have to pay but you can give a donation and we did because that is what helps it stay open and everyone must go see this you won't be disappointed if you love",
          "The story of the Holocaust is described in these walls. From the pictures, the tour, and the actual movies of survivors, you will be amazed. It is an important part of history that an atrocity like this does not happen again. Also, visit an actual rail car that people were",
          "I wouldn't say a museum predicated on genocide is a \"Must See\" for anyone, or even a top pick for \"Things I want to do on vacation.\" Nonetheless, this museum is extremely moving and offers an incredible collection depicting a stain on the history of humankind.",
          "This was the second time I visited. This time I took my adult daughter who found the presentations very informative. There is a wide range of artefacts on show too. The work done by US citizens in rescuing and relocating Jews in WW2 is also well-documented.",
          "Well deeply explained by monitors, beautiful building (not that large as Houston standards), but very nice. If you are a ww2 interest you gonna enjoy",
          "In my opinion, having been to Berlin's Holocaust Museum, this Museum is a little small space-wise. But it makes up for the lack of items and space with an amazing amount of information and history that left me, quite frankly, speechless. It doesn't take long to go through the",
          "This is a very moving museum that tells this history well. Be sure to see the movie inside first. If not always free it is sometimes. Closed on Jewish holidays. Parking lot on site too. We were there about 2 hours. Located in Downtown museum district. The train runs",

          "I went on free museum day: it was super packed, it reminded me of herding cattle... I don't recommend going on this day. It is definitely a museum worth seeing; it does a great job of communicating the events of the Holocaust.",
          "Very sad, deep and serious. I thought it may have too much for my younger daughter but my 13yr old son and 11 yr old daughter did learn that this was an unforgettable, horrific event that should never be repeated. Our tour guide emphasized the hate and spoke how to speak up and",

          "I am and have always been a believer that if you don't educate yourself about the past, you are doomed to repeat it. This museum will definitely give you a front row seat to the atrocities that were committed by the nazi regime... A ton of pre, and post war narrative. Absolutely",
          "very small. Short tour, but very intense and powerful. Glad to have gone. Not for very young children.",
          "This is a local effort and many survivors who live(d) in Houston share their stories in a movie. The museum is a good size to offer a full experience without totally overwhelming you (though the subject matter is indeed overwhelming). Best experienced with a docent.",
          "It is with deepest respect that we go to remember. It's important for us and future generations to never forget what happened. Always a moving experience.",
          "Just an excellent and moving experience. We should never forget. I have a lot to say about this museum, but it is best if ppl have their own experience. Wonderful, moving, unforgetable, worth the time/money.etc.",
          "It was free after 2pm on Thursday. It is worth going. It is mostly regarding families in the Houston area. If you go and there is a school group they usually will have a guide describing the exhibits And can follow along as they provide a bit more information",
          "This museum is very well done and not just about the Holocaust. It does a wonderful job of sharing the history and lessons of the Holocaust but also connects things to how you as an individual can make a difference in today's world keeping in mind the lessons learned from",

          "I feel weird giving a holocaust museum a 5* review, but as far as a museum to help people understand what the holocaust was and how it really changed the world, this museum does a great job at a tough issue. They tie in the holocaust to Texas and it was interesting to see a",
          "Though I have read extensively concerning the holocaust, this museum is exemplary in bringing together so much information in one place. Bits of history I had never heard before explained many things I had wondered about.",
          "We went on a Thursday afternoon when it was free. It takes about 2 hours to get through if you do the audio tour and then stay and watch the movie at the end. Just make sure you have your cell phone charged enough to last the whole audio tour, and bring some headphones. Smaller",
          "My husband and I went on a Thursday afternoon, between the hours of 2:00 - 5:00 admittance is free. The place is small and of course sad, but very informative. I believe everyone needs to go at least once, to put things in prespective - realize how great/good things are now.",
          "We had a guided tour through the museum, which I strongly recommend. It appears to be small but is one of the best museums for content we've been to.",
          "My daughter and I visited the museum due to her introduction to the holocaust at school. I recommend their guided tours, as their tour guides are a fountain of information. If you are the type of person to read every label and description, do plan to be there for a couple of",
          "We are in Houston for a couple of weeks and wanted to see this museum. As we pulled up the building looked small and we believed it would be a short tour. The information they have inside is massive and emotional to see. From picture, videos and artifacts this is a must see to",

          "reviewing these sort of places is always difficult related to the subject matter of the museum itself. to say one enjoyed a visit here is not quite accurate. regardless i feel this is a must for everyone, particularly if you havent been to a holocaust museum before. it does",
          "Very moving place to see. Take tissue. I would go back every time I could. Seeing the train car so many people were forced into was very overwhelming.",
          "This was our first holocaust museum we have been to. While it may make a vacation or pleasure trip a bit somber, it was very educational and is something I never want to forget. The displays were very well done and excellent. They have a great many artifacts that allow us to",
          "I was not sure what to expect and was surprised by the number of artifacts. Our tour group was not too large so you did not get crowded out or have to strain to hear what the tour lead was saying. Good museum for adults and school age children with an interest in history.",
          "Even though it is small but covers a lot of informations of 1930's -40's. Some old artifacts of that time and documentaries. A rail coach is a strong reminder of that black chapter of the history.",
          "This museum is great to learn all about the event and the smaller details you do not learn in school. My girlfriend really enjoyed it, but i myself am not the tragic event museum type. However i did enjoy my visit and was very informative",
          "The Smithsonian offers free admittance to a limited number of museums once a year, so I chose the Holocaust Museum. The museum is very informative, and the Garden of Hope is beautiful and peaceful. An actual German railway car used to transport Jews to extermination camps was",
          "This museum is very interesting. There are a lot of evidence of holocaust in WW2, photos, personal belongings of victims and artefacts. The exposition of the museum is very impressive.",
          "Excellent history of Holocaust - with focus on local relationships as well as comprehensive world view. Moving video testimony by survivors. Memorial garden in rear has a restored Danish rescue boat and a boxcar used to transport prisoners on way to execution camps. Free",
          "The exhibits are fine and of value. But I was greatly underwhelmed by the political correctness of the tour guides. So involved in the memory, can't see the forest for the trees. I was disappointed in the absence of the sense of history. The souls of the victims are crying out!",
          "Lots of history packed into this museum. Take the time to visit and make sure these people are never to be forgotten.",
          "The museum is a good experience for teaching those who have not been exposed to the Holocaust. At the end of the museum tour, there are taped videos from local Houstonians who survived the Holocaust which help to show how much the entire World was impacted by this evil.",
          "What a great museum. It really opens your eyes into this part of history. I will always remember the pictures and stories I saw here.",
          "I've been meaning to get the museum for the several years. A few months ago I finally got the opportunity. It was a super experience and our guide was great. he was also very knowledgeable about all the significant events that transpired during that time period. He was a",
          "The information is very interesting and fun to learn, but the tour we took was a little long-winded. Good experience, and would recommend a visit if you are a history buff.",
          "a very moving and thought provoking environment. The images are haunting. The trip through the museum is very emotional. You can really see how these people were so mistreated.",
          "Not as big as DC but still great and humbling. Take the time to soak up all the history and see the movie they play.",
          "What an amazing museum. I learned so much about not just the Holocaust butabout Houston too. I highly recommend this museum if you are in the area.",
          "This is a very moving and interesting museum to visit. It gives you a little bit more of a history of the families of the holocaust versus the Nazi perspective. They have two exhibits showing how they were transported to the camps. There was also a exhibit for the 9/11 tragedy,",
          "What an incredibly eye opening experience! It only costs a couple of bucks to get in but well worth every penny. We can all benefit by learning the history and pain that was suffered so we never repeat it! Every emotion is felt!",
          "A very well coordinated museum. It's a little small - not like the one in D.C. However, I would highly encourage spending a half day at this museum. On the Saturday that we were there, they had Holocaust survivors tell their stories. It will change you.",
          "Very informative sobering experience. You get a feel for the grief and dismay of the time. I have been twice and each time I discover some new factoid.",
          "Much detail to linger on. Photos, stories, biographies... very interesting. The horror of it all needs to be told over and over. You will not be disappointed. The guided tour was exceptionally hard to hear so I went at my own pace. The only thing I found upsetting was the",
          "Beautiful museum to reflect on and remember the atrocities of the Holocaust. We should never forget!",
          "My friend and I went here not knowing what to expect. She was a little disappointed, but I thought it was interesting. You can either do a self-guided tour or wait for the docent's tour which is at specific times throughout the day. We chose to do our own. There are lots",
          "It is a must see for all those visiting the museum district. So much history that we must learn so we don't repeat it. Came out feeling sad and lucky at the same time. Such atrocities that humans can inflict on others. SO sad",
          "The holocaust is something that we have all heard of and kind of feel like we get it. We understand what happened. (not that we understand what is what like to go through it) but that we understand the events as they have been told to us. With that said, I learned a lot from",
          "Please take the time to read and remember. This is a place where you go and spend the day and the education you get here is amazing.",
          "I'm a museum geek. That is the first thing I look for when I visit a city. I have never experienced what I did when I walked through this museum. I studied about WW2 in History but I didn't realize what happened until I saw the faces of the people who lived it. There are",
          "The main exhibit was all in one large room. There was a lot to read but it was very informative. I was a bit disappointed that there were very few artifacts. The exhibit was mostly pictures and a 30 minute video. I liked how they tied in the personal stories from survivors",
          "One of main sites to visit at Houston, Texas. Respects and honor for jewish. They mark history. Mark history from 30's and 40's in history.",
          "Loved the many forms of presentation, especially with film of survivors living in Houston. Librarian was very helpful to share my particular interest in the Armenian Genocide of 1915.",
          "Let me tell you this experience with my family will be a conversation for many years ! The experience that my family and I had here was amazing , the tour Lady was so knowledgeable. We learned so much from it so detailed but very sad . by the end of our tour we met a holocaust",
          "side trip during 4 day stay in Houston. Stayed about 2 hours. easy access and parking. Very well organized and presented. It is sobering so plan your trip accordingly.",
          "This was my first visit and I thought the museum was excellent and quite moving. I think I read every placard and tried to absorb as much as possible. The film at the end was very moving as well. I was there about 3 1/2 hours and would recommend this museum to everyone but I",
          "When I think I've learned everything about this tragic episode of history, I know I can head to Houston's Holocaust museum to find a new nugget, and be moved again.",
          "Informative and helpful-- this is a well run little museum with friendly, knowledgeable staff and interesting programs.",
          "This museum is beautiful! I highly recommend waiting for the guided tour; it does not cost anything extra. Then go back through and look more closely on your own. The lady that gave us a tour was extremely knowledgeable and told us that there are survivors living in Houston",
          "We actually visited the museum some time back and I'm just reviewing now. This is a great place to look at what really happened to the unfortunate Jews in Germany. We've been to the Holocaust Museum in NYC which is much larger, but we still were impressed with the information",
          "Because of the nature of this museum, it was one that I put off visiting for quite a while. When at last I did visit, I was glad I did. In addition to the expected, historical Jewish Holocaust exhibits, they include temporary exhibits on other Genocides around the world such",
          "I saw a photo exhibit here. It's actually dedicated to all instances of human atrocities, not just the Jewish holocaust.",
          "I visited the Holocaust Museum during a field trip. It is so well done. I brought students and son by bus. The docent was so accommodating. The subject is horrifying, but the museum has presented it in a factual manner. It presents history in a step by step, so to help us",
          "It told the Holocaust story well, but could have had more seating to take in the information. Would have liked more history and artifacts of the Jewish culture and migration.",
          "Very knowledgeable docents. Quiet, dignified - clear presentation of information with no sensationalism.",
          "I took my kids over the weekend to this Houston treasure. We went over the items on display with great care and looked at all the exhibits. The Wall of Tears is a beautiful piece. All in all its a great educational treasure for middle school kids who have questions about our",
          "My wife and I have now visited four different holocaust museums. Each is a bit different, but each time we have left with a great feeling of sadness and we always say \"How did we let this happen?\". The Houston museum is small but very informative. The interviews with local",
          "This is a (relatively) small Museum, but it's informative and has some very powerful exhibits. I have read much about the Holocaust, growing up Jewish, and having an avid interest in history; but this museum still was very informative and educational. The exhibits were both",
          "This was an experience that leaves you practically speechless. You may think you know the history of the holocaust but you don't actually FEEL it until you come see something like this. It was a great, touching experience and all of the exhibits were great and informative. I",
          "My mother's family is Jewish. I thought they all died in the Holocaust, but thanks to the DNA testing offered by Ancestry and 23 and Me, I have discovered family and links I never knew existed... and countries I didn't know family was/is from. The reason I bring this up is one's",
          "Absolutely moving and thought provoking. You will be different after having experienced the exhibits. I also had the opportunity of viewing the Carl Lutz documentary--what an amazing hero to have saved so many at great personal risk.",
          "The museum really is a beautiful dedication to all the pain inflicted by the Holocaust and does a wonderful job portraying the events that occurred during this horrible time. The pictures are exceptional and really show the horrors that the people faced. Towards the end of the",
          "Tour fee of $12.00/USD per person. One-story building. We were greeted by a wonderful guide who gave us a brief history of the museum and the Holocaust itself. We opted for a self-tour, although a guide can take you through if you wish. Has a small section of books, etc for",
          "Breath-taking museum that should be on every Houston visitor's (or resident's) list of things to see. While hopefully the story about the Holocaust is known to most people, it's a good reminder about what happened, why it happened and what the consequences were. The exhibits",
          "i just wondering how this museum got a high rating in trip advisor. Its small and photographs are the main artifacts here.The story of holocaust was nicely explained by the guide but i couldn't hear much of it because of her mild voice and a large number of people",
          "The museum size is smaller compared to giant museums nearby but if you have time don't give it a miss. Has got nice historic items and collections.",
          "This is a holocaust museum that gives special attention to Houstonians who were interned. Of course, the one in Washington D.C. is bigger, however this one is much more personal. You feel more empathy for the victims because they live in this city. There is a huge permanent",
          "As with other musuems on this topic, including those in Washington and Los Angeles, this is not a place to make you happy. But it is well done, and provided a vital reminder of this black piece of world history. The exhibits are informative. Well worth a trip if you are",
          "Went for a school project. This is a small museum with other exhibits around the time period. Overall a good visit.",
          "I went by myself. Enlightening. Well...the first thing is to leave those little crumb snatcher at home or drop them off at Grannie's house. It might be a little too much for them...I take that back, it will be a little too much for them. Use your discretion as to exactly what",
          "I went here with my son's 9th grade class (they just finished Anne Frank). We had 3 different curators leading our group around, and each one of them was extremely knowledgeable. They've packed a lot into this little museum, and there's a boat and train car used during this",
          "There is no way to go through the Holocaust Museum and not be deeply affected by it. We learn that some stories need to be told and re-told lest we forget the barbarity with with humankind often treats its own.",
          "What can one say about that horrible historical experience? Thank God we have this museum to counter doubters of the Holocast with actual relics from that period. Every school child should visit and learn what happened. Hopefully, this will never happen again. Plan on spending",
          "Disliked?? That the Holocaust happened. That aside, the museum was very moving and informative. Once inside I don't think my family said 10 words until we left. You just read, look and absorb and for us, there were no words to be said.",
          "an excellent museum that really helps one understand the history and the people involved. lots of photos, videos, and artifacts from WWII. Even the exterior architecture Is impactful.",
          "A must visit.Their indoor and outdoor exhibits are superb and the audio is very well presented. Staff is very helpful as well.",
          "It was very emotional however, they only showed the \"Jewish Side\" of the story. I believe that there should be a section added where the German soldiers would state their opinions and beliefs over the situation",
          "We went to the Holocaust Museum on Yom HaShoah. There was a very informed guide who spoke about each section of the displays. The images are very graphic and hard to imagine how anyone could have survived when many did not. While the displays were impressive. The Wall of Tears",
          "very interesting artifacts and video of survivors in Houston. Very nice to walk through alone or with a group. The boxcar out back were incredible to see. It's wonderful that so many families donate so much time and money into this place.",
          "I took my 15 yr old daughter here, she wanted to go. Kids today don't get the lessons about WWII that we got. She needed to see the horrific acts that happened. She came away with a deeper understanding of what the Holocaust was and the people affected by it. Free parking in",
          "Be Prepared to have your eyes opened fully! I thought I knew what I was going into, yet came out in tears.",
          "Instead of teaching youth that there will always be hate and they need to recognize it and be ready to stand against it, they sanitize this horror and call themselves a museum of tolerance. Maybe we should learn that there are behaviors that should not be tolerated. Maybe the",
          "The whole tone of this museum seemed just about right for the horrific subject matter. From the approach to the entrance to the main exhibition the atmosphere was of respect for the victims and the story told by the exhibition was a complete condemnation of the Nazi behaviour",
          "Houston is very lucky to have such a museum. At times there are family members of the victims of the Holocaust that are there to speak to the guest of the stories of their relatives. You can go audio so you can go at your own pace. It is surrounded my great restaurants to and",
          "My review isn't exactly objective because I am comparing it to the museum in DC, which is the very best! I did enjoy the history of the local Houston families and how their lives were touched by this horrific event!",
          "A start reminder of the evil that was Nazism, and the threat to the world by the growth of anti-Semitism.Tours of the museum can be harsh, and may not be appropriate for the under 10 generation. The museum often has guided tours by excellent docents.",
          "The Holocaust Museum Houston is an impressive jewel in the museum district. The tour is absolutely the way to go - learning details from this time in history that you likely haven't heard. Stepping into the rail car and seeing the boat, standing in the memorial - sobering",
          "I always wanted to go and when I finally did, I was impressed with what I learned. It's a hard place to visit based on the history it represents but it's important not to forget what happened.",
          "Must see if you're ever in Houston. Beautifully conceived, respectively showcases a tragic period in our world's history",
          "Very good museum. Not so much touchy-feely things in it, it is mainly story boards, photos, and videos. However, it was very educational - I learned a lot of things I never realized. Staff there is very helpful and friendly. Free parking adjacent to the building. Museum is",

          "We did a guided tour of the museum, and our docent, Kurt, was absolutely excellent and imparted so much of his knowledge to this experience. I'd recommend starting your tour by viewing the 30 minute movie that runs on a constant loop at the entrance to the museum; it consists of",
          "In one word, history. Never forget! It could happen again and to any race. A MUST SEE! Not a lot to see, but very powerful!",
          "I listened to the audio tour on my cell phone. I highly recommend it. It is an hour and 15 min and I was able to complete it after we left. I didn't expect my 11 year old to want to stay that long but if you are willing...there is enough to see/hear/read to take up more than an",
          "The exhibits are informative and horrifying. However, the museum is small and the space isn't sufficient to develop the overall narrative.If you know the history, the exhibits will engage you. If you don't know the history, I'm not sure that the experience will be as powerful.",
          "I walked in and it was free for students. They had a few tour groups going but since I went alone, I walked past them and listened to their stories. I was fascinated by the art and pictures that were portrayed. This was a good learning experience.",
          "This museum is very well designed. The exhibits provide a great mix of emotion and information. My main issue was the crowd. Our Saturday tour group of 30-40 barely fit into the exhibit halls. It was difficult to hear the guide at times, and I felt claustrophobic. When the guide",
          "The museum is a great place to visit and learn about the Holocaust. It has so much information and was very interesting.",
          "Thought provoking and appropriately sad. Remarkable how positive, hopeful and courageous the prisoners were during one of the darkest hours in human history. Gives us an opportunity to reflect and appreciate.",
          "Nice overview of Holocaust. Pictures, descriptions, and tour guides paint an adequate picture of the events. Excellent for young people to learn world history. Only asks for donations.",
          "This is a very well done exhibit of one of the worst times in our history. There are photos, art work and the guides are excellent. Everyone should see this place!",
          "Excellent museum. Very well done. Meaningful, educational, interesting and important. A must see for older children, teens and adults of all ages, races and religions.",
          "Worth seeing for sure. The wall of tears, the train car, the boat... Very moving place to educate us and for us to pause in remembrance. Didn't take the tour because it was an hour long. We were not sure we would be staying that long. Students got in free- at least when we",
          "Pretty small, but still remarkable! Very organized with easily accessible elements to see. Free parking and for students it was free -- we didn't have our student ID's with us and they took our word, which we thought was super nice.",
          "This museum is full of great information about the Holocaust. I've visited many different museums on this topic, and this one had information and photos I had not seen before! The only down side is it is quite small, but don't let that deter you. Also, it is FREE for students",
          "Took my family to see. Very well put together. Also shows other countries that have gone thru genocide and shares personal experiences from survivors. Very informational and emotional.",
          "This is the third holocaust museum that I have visited in a year. Each one has been different. This one disturbed me more than the others. It was in a small space and maybe that bothered me given the story being told. The docent was very knowledgeable and was gracious but firm",
          "This museum has limited material, such as original artifacts, but does a wonderful job with what it has. They use photos and storyboards to present the holocaust and how it affected the victims. They also do a wonderful job of personalizing the stories, particularly in telling",
          "Been to the Washington D.C. and the Chicago museums, this was amazing in terms of the architecture, and the attempt to relate the museum to the Houston Jewish community. If you are going to the museum campus, take the time and go, so you don't forget.",
          "I went with my High School daughter as part of a history requirement. I have always been interested in history and the museum was a incredible learning experience. Everyone needs to know this history. I liked the way it connected Houston survivors.",
          "The sombre industrial look to the exterior of this small museum sets the tone for one's visit despite the friendly welcome received from the staff. The displays are well set out but some of the information boards are difficult to read as they are on the back of the displays and",
          "I sat through the movie twice... thank you for capturing the survivors and their memories on film. Take a guided tour and take your time.",
          "With an interest in anything WWII related, I always find these types of museums/ memorials appealing and the Houston one does not disappoint. It is a small museum but offers regular tours (we didn't participate, but it sounded hugely interesting and in depth). The film at the",
          "My family and me are history lovers' and this museum has everything we want to know about the WWII from a very special point of view, the history is well shared and there are a lot of images to complement the story lines, but if you are not a fluent english speaker is not the",

          "This place is somber as it should be. It is very respectful and displays the necessary honor regarding the victims and survivors of the WWII Holocaust. It is a place of integrity and remembrance that really allows young people to gain a proper appreciation for the horrors and",
          "I wasn't sure I wanted to visit this museaum because I am an emmotional person, but I'm sure glad I did! It isn't that big, but by the time you spend time on reading everything, it takes a few hours. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know. Good experience for teens, but",
          "Few places who tell the story of The Holocaust can boast of the tremendous collection and stories as Houston's Holocaust Museum. Survivors guide you through one of the most horrendous atrocities of our time and there are so many surprises. It is both educational and",
          "I did not know quite what to expect. The Holocaust Museum is located near Hermann Park in a pleasant, tree-lined area. Once inside, I was moved beyond words. Every exhibit was highly personal yet presented in a tasteful manner. Please take the time to watch each video.",
          "This place was very depressing. For obvious reasons. I've watched movies and documentaries and have read books but none of those compares to being at the Holocaust Museum. They had interviews with Holocaust survivors playing and all these visuals there that made it that much",
          "It's a small location, but really packed with interesting pictures and history! Well worth the visit! It's not suitable for young children.......Best for Teenagers and up!",
          "Thoughtfully designed, the museum takes you through a journey of understanding. Never preachy or overwrought, the effect of the exhibitions is one of wonder, horror, understanding, empathy. Houston citizens are profiled in terms of history, how they survived and even thrived",
          "Although it was heartwrenching to get through the exhibits including the 911 exhibit, this was my first time at a museum om this subject even though I have read a lot about it.Well worth it.",
          "The holocaust museum is one of the best museums in Houston and the most poignant. Tours are available given by docents who have been trained by the museum and are completely knowledge about the history of the period. There is also a 9-11 exhibit at the museum with artifacts and",
          "Very nicely done museum. Be prepared to read lots of small note cards on the walls, however, The most moving part of the museum for me was watching the movie were survivors tell their stories. Once viewing, step outside and see the train car and boat.",
          "The WWII exhibition was excellent, though as expected, very similar to what you may find at other holocaust exhibitions. The temporary 9/11 exhibition was very good too, and made me very emotional! As did the railway cart outside, truly poignant and thought provoking.",
          "If you've never been to a Holocaust museum, you need to come see it. It's a really good experience for those who've never been to one before. If you've been to other Holocaust or WWII museums, you probably won't be that impressed and may be better off skipping it. I've been",

          "This is a wonderful overview of the Holocaust with some local input too. Everyone should see it once.",
          "Not quite as descript as the one in DC but if you want to learn about the Holocaust this is the place to gather information and run with it. Very well done and decript enough to get the picture inside and out. Totally reccommend this musuem if you want to learn....many parts",
          "this is a place that we all need to visit ..It's a very sad shameful part of the cruelty that humans experienced & it must teach us to NEVER EVER let this happen again There were many brave & amazing people who risked their lives for others so it also shows hope & Love",
          "Excellent history and connections with local residents was very interesting. Extremely moving. near museum of art and other cultural venues",
          "The museum was interesting and presented part of it in terms of survivors who lived in Houston. The subject is terrible but it needs to be seen. The most interesting parts for me were outside the museum. They have a railcar that was used and also a boat that was used to try",
          "You better read or see a movie, but the experience was not good, there is not a good arrangement of the information in the museum, I felt lost.",
          "Our visit to HMH was a little unnerving for some of my family members but was heart-opening. It wasn't overwhelming like our Dachau Concentration Camp visit but we definitely got the message. Holocaust Museum Houston is free each Thursday from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. and on Memorial",
          "It is very well done and presented. Being in the museum district makes it very assessable and full of history about the Holocost",

          "The museum is small by most standards but definitely gets the message across. From video testimonials from holocaust survivors to an actual railcar that carried victims to the gas chambers. Very well done.",
          "I loved our visit to the Holocaust Museum in Houston. Since we're college students we got in free of charge and I was ecstatic. It's rare that museums allow that nowadays, especially since we were paying a lot to go to other museums in the area. The museum was very nicely laid",
          "It is a small but interesting museum. That place make you feel and think in everything that happen to this persons and how the human being is capable to hurt",
          "This is a jewel! Go on a day they have guided tours, it is exceptional. We met a survivor and heard his story, it was truly exceptional!",
          "Great information, displayed in a very easy to read and follow fashion. They have some neat artifacts and great tour guides. It's also usually fairly quiet and calm, which is nice if you are looking to do a solo trip.",
          "This museum covers a very emotional and serious topic in a sensitive manner that honors the memories of the victims while educating people on the historical significance of the Holocaust. You won't get museum-fatigue.",
          "It is totally unbelievable how some people don't believe that this really happened. I wept through many of the exhibits. I thing everyone should walk through this piece of historical information. One of the most moving things was the video of he people that had lived through",
          "Everyone of every faith and ethnicity should visit this museum to see a part of history, often overlooked. It is meaningful, beautiful and the staff does a great job.",
          "This is one of the best museums I have ever visited. The verbal testimonies of the survivors were especially moving. It is very well laid out with the history of the Holocaust in words and pictures and outside a railway carriage that was used to transport people to the",

          "We learn about the Holocaust in school. But even that does not prepare you for what you are about to see and hear. Even though it brought it all to full light and caused us all to have such a depressed feeling, this museum should be visited by all. You will quickly learn to",

          "Very well done. Not too big, not too small. A history lesson we should NEVER forget. Lots of personal items and stories. The most moving exhibit is the train car. This is an original train car used to transport Jews to the extermination/labor camps. It sits outside of the",

          "Very informative spot to learn even more about the holocaust and WW2. There were many facts I did not know and I have read a good deal about WW2 and seen concentration camps in person. The only downer of the trip was the tour guide that snapped at me for taking a picture",

          "My family and I went to visit this weekend. I am so happy that I went. I learned so much about  the holocaust and the history of those who made it out scarred but alive. I was truly humbled by the experience.",
          "Amazing new design, the exhibits are awesome and the staff is very welcoming and always so helpful. I've learned so much by going there.",
          "It was a memorable experience, but the artifacts need better labels to tie them to their description.\nSome artifacts were missing, and some electronic exhibits were not functioning. Overall a good experience, but it felt lacking.",
          "A good place for history enthusiasts",
          "Beautiful place. Extremely interesting.  Sad but we all need to know about our past history.",
          "Great museumn for history lovers and anyone wanting to expand their knowledge. It's very informative. Due to the subject matter it can be an emotional experience, I encourage everyone to visit.",
          "It takes 1.5 to get through the first floor. You can read everything... it is not overwhelming. A great museum. They do not allow pictures in the museum which I think every museum that outlines such horrific events should do. The second floor has an exhibit of Samuel Bak's art. You can take pictures up there.",
          "Everybody should go to this museum at least once in their life. We all need to remember what people are capable of, and as human beings make sure that nothing like this is ever allowed to take place again.",
          "I would recommend everyone visit the Holocaust Museum.",
          "Loved the way they included stories of survivors who settled in Houston. A very well designed and fascinating experience!",

          "Somber reminder of a terrible moment in human history. We must never forget.",
          "Must visit.place. After the renovations you will see all you need to know. I loved the exhibit on hunting down the Nazis",
          "Saw the museum at the temporary location. Interesting, but small. If you\u2019ve been to Holocaust or WWII museums in DC, or Europe you could probably skip this. Would be interested in checking out at the permanent location after the renovation.",
          "If you wanna come here make sure your kid (or you) aren't to sensitive, when I went as a kid I was kind of sad, but that's just because well, it's the Holocaust and I was sensitive. Overall informative though",
          "Very nice remodel. Check it out.",
          "Very Informative place. Tour was done by a actual man that escaped as a child.",
          "Worth the visit, small but informative and well done.",
          "It broke my heart to watch the story testimony of holocaust survivors. It also make me realize that genocide was happened in the past and must watch for future possibilities of another genocide. Share and tells if we knew  about human rights violations.",
          "I went to see this exhibit a few years ago on Christmas Eve. It was a really humbling experience",
          "Great place, you can see everything in 1.5 hour. Not too big but great.",
          "The local Houstonians that provided there story was very well done. Yes I truly agree on that fact. It\u2019s very informative and sad but needed to learn. My friends and I will visit again but it\u2019s truly a very informative experience. Please visit more museums like this it\u2019s truly an aw experience. I highly recommend",
          "I pray we can learn from history, because we humans have done unbelievably bad things to one another.",
          "This place is amazing.. Its depressing and eye opening, but well worth coming and experiencing for yourself!",
          "It was very informative and unfortunately very sad. Worth the trip.",
          "Less the world forget man's inhumanity to man.  The museum is a great reminder of this. To think that only 70+ years after this evil was done, there are still people/groups that say it never happened.",
          "Quite an experience, The stories of the survirors really touch Your Soul.",
          "The expansion and additions are a great touch to the Holocaust history.",

          "Incredible, shocking, a must-go",
          "Sad .but infomative",

          "We must remember that this must not happen again.",
          "It was a neat experience. We went on a Sunday since it is free to attend Sundays. It is currently at a temporary location until the main location opens this summer. It is a lot smaller, and of course some items weren't there, like the \u2026",
          "Despite that I already knew the story, this place still moved me. It's hard to put into words the feels. I highly recommend that everyone visit this place at least once. Of course they're about to move so you'll have to wait until the new location opens!",
          "Current location has a few items, I know it\u2019s temporary. Other current down for me was military discount is only for active duty personnel. At 12 dollars a person I would of waited till they move back. There is some pictures and items you can see. The video room was down and same with the talking hologram when I was there.",
          "This taught me many things...",
          "Great Museum. Sometimes history is Obviously sad but educational none the less. Other than observations on the holocaust they also had some really great art.",
          "Not much to it. Went there with the woman for her project. I've been to Dachau and several other sites in Europe so I've seen the real deal. This museum leaves much to be desired in terms of museums. Start to finish in about 20 minutes. \u2026",
          "Lots of information and displays. It was a very educational your.",
          "Even tho this was only the temporary location while the official museum is being remodeled, it was truly touching. I was fortunate to have a tour done by the son of a family who survived the holocaust. It was truly special and he was magnificent.",
          "Well-created exhibitions including original paintings.",
          "The new exhibits are organized in a deliberate way. This museum is a sober reminder of what happens when bystanders stay silent.",
          "I have only been to the temporary location, but it was very well done. The local Houstonians that provided there story was very well done. Looking forward to the new building this year. A top notch education stop for teens. My daughter and I had a long discussion afterwords. An eye opening for her.",
          "I thought that it would be a fun place to visit, but when I got there it was extremely boring, they mostly had pictures. I just intended to see the items recovered after the holocaust but all they had were shoes and burnt clothes. The kids \u2026",
          "Poor content, but automated audio guidance is great.  Be sure to bring headphones because you may dial a phone number and you can start the tour, unless you take guided tour (check by phone/website prior your visit)The staff in general in spite of security is professional and polite.",

          "We got here on re-opening day around noon.  They had just remodeled and still didn\u2019t have everything inside completely set up, but it was still amazing.  I had been there over ten years ago and now was checking it out after remodel.  It was \u2026",
          "Its a place I will never forget you get to see tangible proof of the Holocaust and artifacts it's a very sobering place I do plan on returning again",
          "It\u2019s been a good time since the last time I visited the museum. It appears the location has been moved to Kirby Dr temporarily as the original location goes through renovations.\n\nI will speak about both. Either place the experience you have \u2026",
          "A sad but real place.  Humanity should never forget the holocaust or we are doomed to repeat it.",
          "Good place.",
          "I like that it's free on Sundays, it's not a big tour, you can walk through yourself pretty quickly or have a tour guide. The tour guide gives you a TON of information that makes the tour probably about 45 minutes to an hour long. We were \u2026",
          "This place was truly amazing. We got a Groupon for it. Walking in you could really feel that you were in the presence of history. The guide took us on a tour and walked us through ancient to modern history of the Jewish people. It was \u2026",
          "At this time, they are in a temporary location. They'll be moving back to the museum district when they're permanent facility is fully renovated. Even if this time, it has very good displays about the Holocaust and even features the \u2026",

          "Gives you a better understanding with the photos, video and audio of people who lived through it.",
          "It's a very sombering experience. Our guide today was well versed and very sweet.  It's heartbreaking really -what man is capable of... But I think EVERYONE should go and learn about the atrocities of man so that we are not doomed to repeat them.",
          "Very good customer service",
          "Very humble experience",
          "Very educational & absolutely a must see. The staff was stern but at least friendly in explaining the rules and such, at the time of this review posting they are missing a few physical objects from the exhibits (the library area was closed \u2026",
          "The staff are nice and the displays are interesting but it is emotionally difficult to see how horrible the Nazis were to the Jews during World War 2. The movie in the theater is especially tough to watch as you hear the survivors stories.",
          "Pretty good, but some of the omissions seemed selective.",
          "I was able to learn a lot on the tour guide and our guide was fairly interactive.",
          "Great staff. 1.3 to 2hr to complete tour.",
          "liked the neat place, an enriched history of Jewish people. Helpful representative.",
          "A testament of man\u2019s inhumanity to their fellow man. Racists and Alt-Right folks should spend a day here learning what their ideals a modeled after.",

          "My youngest daughter and I have visited this museum many times and we are so moved by the displays therin that we know we will visit again and again. I cannot wait to have the opportunity to see the $34 million dollar renovation that \u2026",
          "An amazing and emotional experience",
          "My 6 boys from 6-24 were speechless. My little ones have never been and were stunned at what they saw. They were saddened but understood about the value of life",
          "Grand reopening was on June 22th... but closed on the June 30th, my planed visit day. It will reopen on July 3th.",
          "A place everyone should visit.",
          "Very well done! A fitting tribute!",
          "New additions are incredible",
          "Do not go to this temporary location, there is nothing meaningful or engaging about the experience here. Wait until they move back to their permanent location in the museum district.",
          "The museum is interesting.  They push you to take a \"tour\" where the guide explains almost every wall hanging photo and article.  It was a bit monotonous,  but it was slightly informative.  If you are in your 60's, like us, and have studied \u2026",
          "Good little walk-through place. I enjoyed hearing the survivor stories and looking at the artifacts.",
          "Nice place and easy parking",

          "Learned so much. Definitely, a place to take the kids. Eye opening conversations.",
          "The museum is in a transition between its old and future locations. There are interesting and informative displays, but it is very small considering Houston is a major city with a substantial number of museums. It's definitely worth a visit, but it doesn't have the impact it should.",
          "Very informative, lots of things to look at and free tours with the ticket! I only cried 3 times.",
          "Went through the tour, the tour guide stops in the middle to yell at a poor lady with her phone out. Not to mention his droning on and on about his life story. Anybody planning to visit go on your own through out the exhibit.",
          "Its was very educational, the history was very real",
          "Our to tour guide was full of personal information about the Holocaust. My grandkids we're very interested and all the information she provided.",
          "Walked for about two hours with my 7 year old and it felt like we were there for a couple of minutes. My daughter was very focused and interested. Having the tour on your phone helped alot to have a better understanding. Great place and friendly staff!!!",
          "Found out the 442nd",
          "Great, a lot of history",
          "Great Exhibits and presentation. However, the price is a bit steep. I would recommend if you could visit on a reduced price.",
          "Will be better come june 22nd when they reopen in their original location",
          "I haven\u2019t been to this one in Houston \nBut I have been to the one in Israel \nBut would love to visit this one",

          "A must see when in the Houston area!",
          "Good place, very informative.....however it sets a sad tone for the day.",
          "Has a number of taped interviews with Jews who survived the Holocaust and settled in Houston.  Artifacts not so exciting.",
          "We caught them in transition to the new place, so there weren't a ton of exhibits. The temporary exhibit (City of Numbers) was pretty sparse, and presented little context for the data it presented, but enjoyable.\n\nThe good.\nWhat they had \u2026",
          "It was very informative",
          "They've currently relocated because of the floods and it's fairly impressive how nice the place looks for a temporary home. They have plans to make a huge museum that looks great. I highly suggest anyone to visit here, because even though \u2026",
          "We ended up spending 2 hours there even though It's a small museum. Very informative. The movie at the end of the museum almost made me cry, but it was an experience to hear from the Holocaust survivors.",
          "This is a must see museum. You can walk the museum at your own pace or participate in the group tour they have. The museum also includes stories from local Houston resident who survived the holocaust. In addition, they have a 30 minute \u2026",
          "I had to come for my History class. I needed to visit, take notes and write a paper back home. That was very hard to do because the museum was so small and I didn't learn anything new. \nIt's inside an office park which is super odd. I like \u2026",
          "A moving experience. Highly recommend the tour! Our guide was very informed and polite in answering questions. The video of interviews from survivors brought me to tears. A must see. Learned so much. They also had a Syrian refugee exhibit in the back. (Picture)",
          "Creepy collection of arts they have but yes I understand that it's about the Holocaust. One thing that I like are the staff quite knowledgeable to entertain questions.",
          "For me, this museum is much smaller than I expected. However, smaller doesn't mean something bad. It might be small from the outside, but the inside contains all of the richest information about Holocaust and WWII. For that reason, I'm \u2026",
          "Very informative and also depressing.",
          "Its actually unbelievable but I am glad to open the eyes of their understanding. The history, the knowledge.. It touches you deeply to read, see and hear what happened. Great place to visit.",
          "Temporary Location is in the Office Park! I strongly recommend going to this museum. It is somber and sobering jolt to the reality of how far people can go off course. Very professionally laid out exhibits and excellent narrative educate \u2026",
          "Very moving and excellent information about unknown facts provided.  Great way to expand knowledge.",
          "An amazing experience, educational and sobering. Definitely will be making another trip.",
          "It's not in its usual place, it's getting a remodel, but temporary area was not hard to find, and we were blown away by the actual items and pictures detailed here. Very interesting and solemn tour given by volunteers.  Actual survivors \u2026",
          "Not very many things to interact with",
          "Absolutely AMAZING to learn Houston has a museum. Took my children & learned some things that I never knew before. What an honor it was to hear some of the stories & see some of the objects from that time. And an outstanding new bit of \u2026",
          "Was pretty detailed though the venue is temporary. Found out about new stories and experiences that really moved me. Still wearing a bracelet that encourages me to remember what others have gone to.",
          "A place to learn some history and teach kids.",
          "Very modern.",
          "Really a great experience!  You need to be quiet and there is a lot to read though you can use your phone and get much of it read to you.  I found it difficult to listen and look at it all at the same time so i just read it.  The only \u2026",
          "I have been to many hollocaust museums around the world...  in Germany,  In India, Israel and Uruguay... Whenever I find out that there is one I will make it a point to tour it. Lest we forget! Each time I go I learn a little bit more \u2026",

          "Very organized museum and you'll always leave with a very informed and transformed mind.\n\nLots of things to look at and a myriad of emotions to feel. It is a rewarding experience. Not one that should be passed up.\n\nFree passes for students. Free parking on the premises.",
          "Liked the animatronics",
          "As HUGE WW2 historians this place was not as big or as detailed as one would expect. The security guard harassed us about having a multitool - which made me wonder, why not have them wear brown shirts?",
          "Absolutely the best museum in Houston. From start to finish it is just impacting how much thought they put into this. The ending (not going to spoil it) is perfect.",
          "Everyone should go there, it's sad to think about what they went through but it being shown hopefully will make people more aware",
          "Very sad place but worth the trip",
          "Unbelievable how vivid the museum makes the nightmare of this low point in humanity.",
          "Pretty neat place.  Only 3 stars b/c it's a little overpriced for what it is.  But if you're into it, it's definitely something to check out.  I'm a museum buff.",
          "This Holocaust Museum was very nice, I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about this history topic.",
          "The tour guide made the experience exceptional. She was well knowledged. If it wasn't for her, I may have rated the experience 3 stars since the temp facility is so small. I will definitely be back when the remodeling is completed. I do \u2026",
          "Overpriced, not enough artifacts presented. Most of the information is good, but you can see that on the history or national geographic channel. The person presenting the tour spends about 15 minutes in each of the 4 partition sections, and \u2026",
          "Historically important",
          "Such a deep feeling place! We must never forget! When they have their new building I am sure it will be a 5 Star!",
          "So they don\u2019t give veterans  discounts but you give active military discounts on this day which is really messed up they Fought for our country much as active military does",

          "I really love this place. It's unimaginable what these people endured. Love and respect.",
          "I went with my family and we decided to take the tour of the museum and the tour guide was awesome. He was very knowledgeable and told us interesting facts and stories about the pictures and objects in the museum. I really enjoyed my time here and I definitely recommend the tour!",
          "Really powerful, moving experience - definitely worth checking out, but only in the proper state of mind. It can be a heavy, deeply-upsetting experience, but vital and necessary.",
          "The New Holocaust museum has doubled in size and now boasts an expansion & 2 addtl floors. There is a parking for fee lot and meter parking that takes cash or credit on the street  Discovered their lot is cheaper!  Appropriate for all ages \u2026",
          "I would have thought that the museum should have been more emotional and thought provoking in order to ensure that this NEVER occurs again.  The ONLY thing worth seeing was the interactive display with the survivor where you could ask questions and get answers to 1600 prerecorded sound bytes (ask him his favorite joke!!)",
          "Great place even in there temp location.  We cannot forget what happened.  If we ever do forget, it will happen again.",
          "Not too large, but very nicely done, and such an important place to visit. It's tough to see, but oh so important that we keep these memories alive, so that awful history such as this one never repeats itself.",
          "Economical, very important historic experience. Age appropriate for 11 and 13 y/o familiar with the history. Very well thought out and kept up for 20 yrs. Note: major renovation coming up in next month. Temporarily relocated.",
          "So cool",
          "Very small. Good info he basics. \n\nthe rent a cops took their job a little too seriously.. didn\u2019t have to walk by every 30 second to remind everyone no pics or food. \n\nThank god we didn\u2019t have to pay (was free for military members this \u2026",
          "Excellent museum",
          "Note: this is for the temporary location.\nTip: Groupon is easy to get, $11/2 people\n\nInsightful permanent exhibit, I enjoyed walking through and learning some detailed history. It is nice to have a reminder from time to time of what we do \u2026",
          "I visited the HMH a few years ago and it was the most humbling experience ever. What a beautiful experience. The exhibits were so heart felt and extremely touching. So sad yet so lucky for the ones that made it out alive.",
          "Overall, I left feeling pretty disappointed. The holocaust museum was at a temporary site while they worked on the primary site. However, it was very small (like 4 small hallways) of exhibits. Having gone to the holocaust museum in DC, my \u2026",
          "Good story..",
          "Was being re built but this was one of the best experiences i had, had a tour and learned everything about this sad event.",
          "GREAT place to get more info and become aware of what happened. Tour guide was very informative and the care of rhe museum is very apparent. Staff was also very nice. Great place for children to learn what happened to these people so that the mistake foes not occur again. They have a small give area.",
          "I try to come here about once a year. Always learn something new.",

          "A very moving place.",
          "It was a great experience. I loved how everything tied into the Holocaust  (the exterior, the smoke stack, the metal structure inside was for the railroad tracks). \nI was sad to hear that they were going to tear down the existing museum \u2026",
          "I have taken many students here. I am always excited to see the amazement in the eyes of my \"adult\" students. Many of them are not familiar with the Holocaust. Its actually unbelievable but I am glad to open the eyes of their understanding. Happy that Houston has a Holocaust Museum ",
          "A very, very bad place to wind up when you've accidentally consumed LSD-25 (long story), but I'm not going to hold that against them. It's bleaker and realer than you'd expect if it's been a while since you really dug into the Holocaust and \u2026",
          "A nicely realized memorial. Chock full of history, memories, horrors, miracles).  With all due respect to the docents, I would have liked a self-directed tour, perhaps by audio tape (on/off).",
          "We were lucky enough to take a tour with a daughter of a survivor... truly magnificent story and though the main site is being worked on the temp site is still very much worth the visit. If you get the chance, take the guided tour.",
          "Museum did a great job with the students. The videos at the end are very good and need to be watched by all. Staff was very friendly. Definitely not as good as the regular muesum, but for being an off site they did well.",
          "So much sad but wonderful education, great place to visit",
          "I was hoping for more artifacts. It\u2019s really small. If you are someone that knows nothing about the Holocaust, then this place might be enjoyable. I was expecting something more in depth.",
          "Very informative display of the Holocaust. Easy parking. Musem was very clean and quiet. Not a place to take children, as it is a lot of reading. A bit disappointed that so many of the artifacts were out for cleaning. But still obsorbed a lot of information. Students were able to get in for free and tickets were only $12.",
          "Eye opening.",
          "I visited the temporary exhibit. Expected to see more artifacts. Still very informative nonetheless.",
          "This museum is a perfect place to learn of the atrocities that were brought upon the Jewish people. My heart continues to sense the grevious acts committed by Hitler and his henchmen. The photos and the relics are amazing! The museum \u2026",
          "Great place to walk",
          "Lots of information. Very interesting. Definitely recommend visiting",
          "I found out when we arrived this was a short term location.  So the museum was very small but packed with a lot of stories and history.  If you like history you might like attending this museum!",
          "A truly special place to remember a horrific time in history. The entire museum contains many symbolisms and many stories from Holocaust survivors. If you are a student - elementary to college - it is a place you must go and visit. Truly a \u2026",
          "The actual museum in the museum district is under remodeling so this is a temporary location. My recommendation is to visit in June once the original location reopens.",

          "Absolutely loved It! This was my 1st time going, ironically on the day they are shutting down for a new location to be even bigger. We had the kids so we didn't see as much as we had liked but, it was amazing. The history, the knowledge.. \u2026",
          "History reminds us, of how cruel someone one can be and how much we need Gods direction in our lives because men can only be so mean to others.",

          "Very educational. Our tour guide was very informative and patiently answered all questions.",
          "It was shorter than I expected, but that may be due to a temporary hosting venue being used during renovations the original location was undergoing. Looking forward to visiting again once it has been moved back and experiencing it in it's full scale.",
          "I think every one should visit.",
          "Small but amazing use of the space. A thirty minute video showing touching interview with survivors shows on loop followed by a walk through of literature, items, and photos for the Holocaust. There is a separate art exhibition showing art relating to genocide that is small but very good.",
          "Excellent narrator and eye/ mind opening experience.",
          "I have been here 3 times and it is truly an experience that everyone should have. I've also been to the one in D.C., as well as have visited the camps in Poland, including the infamous Auschwitz. I believe this to be the best experience of \u2026",

          "Just the outside was amazing to see. Unfortunately when I visited, the main location was closed due to renovations. The renovations were scheduled to be completed in September 2017 per the sign on the door. I visited November 2017 and they \u2026",

          "So interesting to learn about what happened in the past and why we must understand so it does not happen again.",
          "Should check out. Hits History to know about and be aware of",
          "One of the first exhibits, a prayer book....they hyphenated the word \u201cGod.\u201d From that point on, I \u2018saw\u2019 other exhibits, but all I could think about was that sign. The museum to teach us about the genocide of Jewish people and could not spell God. \nBut, in general, the museum was informative.",
          "It is way smaller than I expected but they have some very cool artifacts, but again not very many.",
          "Always impressed by the programs offered here. Saw the film Sarma Neighbor about a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan. Afterwards, Dayana shared her experiences as a Syrian refugee with her husband and kids relocated to Houston 3 years ago.",
          "Very humbling experience",
          "Went on a Sunday (it was free this day). We went late so we missed the tour, but everything was spaced out great and flowed very nicely. we will be back to complete the guided tour and watch the doc.",
          "This was an excellent display of history.  It was super reading intensive.  If you don't want to read every sign, you aren't going to get much out of this.  Be patient and take it all in.",
          "Very informative, really humbling. Recommend to visit to learn more about this time.",
          "Meabingful reminder as to the history of the SS. Somber details and graphic images are for us to not forget and never allow this to happen again. Namaste",
          "I have been to the one in DC and this one is great also",
          "The exhibition is laid out chronologically. The theater offers a variety of survivor testimonies & documentaries. A revolutionary experience that stunningly depicts how hate fueled genocide.",
          "Very nice & educational",
          "Very interesting and informative. Wonderful employees and awesome displays.",
          "I was disappointed that the exhibit was not more interactive.  Without that layer it fell flat and evoked no emotion.  It is IMPERATIVE that we learn a lesson from our past and without emotion you cannot form empathy.\n\nOn another note, the interactive interview portion with the holocaust survivor was and deed \"all that and a biscuit\"",
          "Very nice and well educated museum, If I ever find my self back in Texas, I will be visiting again!",
          "The history here is well laid out and a great learning experience. My 10-yr old daughter learned some history and had a great civil rights lesson.",
          "Very informative and great staff!",

          "Very informative but the desk clerk was a bit unfriendly.",

          "Stories and artifacts enlighten the mind and creates awareness of this difficult period in history.",

          "It was a very educational and emotional experience.",
          " Everyone should visit this museum. It is the 4th largest in the U.S. and is very well done. We took the tour and then went back through to read more. I was incredibly moved. ",
          "Highly recommend coming on Sunday. Admission is free and it\u2019s a great learning experience for the little kids.",
          "Enlightenment",
          "Excellent presentation of history in a format for all ages. My 12 year old son loved it and learned so much. I also learned so much more. This is a definite \" must- see\".",
          "It was sobering. I knew the major details of the Holocaust, but there were so many things I was unaware of. Walking through the museum was heartbreaking. Seeing pictures and reading what so called humans can do to other human beings tore at \u2026",

          "Love this museum and the message they spread. No more hate! Can't wait for the new building. ",
          "I took my 13 year old stepson here and we absolutely loved it.  It is such an informational museum - the guided tour is amazing and eye opening.  The museum is free admission but they do take donations, which I suggest doing.  The people who work here know what they are doing and do a terrific job. ",
          "Very educational.  I know a good bit about the holocaust and I still learned something.  It is a very sobering experience.  I've also visited the Washington DC Holocaust Museum.  I feel like DC is set up just to wreck your emotions (perhaps \u2026",
          "Better wait until the museum is finished .this is a scam",
          "Great experience",
          "Can't wait to see the place once the new building is conpleted.",
          "The guides are great at it's an extremely informative tour. I highly recommend getting a guide.",
          "I was a chaperone to a school event. At first glance, it is visually disappointing, especially since it is a temporary location while they have a complete overhaul and expansion at the permanent location, but that is just a superficial \u2026",
          "It's a small museum that is very heart-wrenching. It has very many interesting stories, pictures, and artifacts. Would definitely recommend. It's important to keep these stories alive.",
          "I enjoyed the visit , the tour guide was very nice and informative, he did a great job. The museum is in a warehouse area not in the musem disctrict and not as well decorated like I had expected I went to one in DC and it was a night and \u2026",
          "Very educational spoke with Sam in the interactive exhibit it was beautiful even if he was only a simulation of the real man.",

          "Learn some new information while there.  Very poignant pictures & memerobelia, made it very real!",
          "This museum should have been more in-depth and extensive. We only spent 10 minutes in the museum and that included the restroom break we took. It is literally 3 rooms and the first room is dedicated to promoting homosexuality. Personally, I \u2026",
          "Amazing space where people can really reflect on history and its connection to current issues.",
          "The place us small but you do learn a whole lot. I've been here a a couple of times and I've never been disappointed. There's so much history here.",
          "A must see!! Even if you aren't a history nut, I'd recommend it. They will be opening in their brand new building in spring 2019 with a children's room and an Anne Frank room too. I'll be going back then to see more! It doesn't cost a lot either.",
          "Nothing I haven't seen.  Disappointing.",
          "a real experience",
          "Recommend visiting, especially if you're traveling on extended personal or business trips (Most definitely visit the one in DC if you have the opportunity). Prepare yourself mentally for the tragedies of WWII. It is an important reminder \u2026",
          "Very well done museum on one of history's most horrific events.  The film is very moving and the rest of the museum walks you through some of the most impactful aspects the Jewish culture and life during nazi Germany. Must visit if you're in town, it will change your life.  Takes about 1.5 hours.",
          "The ladies at the front desk were wonderful! Thank you for being so welcoming to us Montana people!",

          "I love taking my kids to this place so they may never forget....",
          "The docents are excellent and there is so much information there despite it's relativity small size. I've recently went there as a field trip, and I learned so much! I recommend this museum to anyone who wants to learn about this tragedy and why we shouldn't let it happen again.",
          "Having been at the Holocaust Museum in D.C.,  this one is rather lacking. Perhaps when their new location opens, they will have more to display.",
          "Great museum, everything is nicely displayed. The Holocaust Museum is simultaneously a very calm but also disturbing place. Definitely worth a visit when when in Houston.",
          "I am glad there is a Holocaust Museum here. And the displays and movies are accurate. But I listened to a docent tell school kids many many inaccurate \"facts\". So sad when these kids could learn how to recognise signs of fascism in their own country if they heard the true and accurate story.",
          "Its good to not forget the past and really see what happened. Good place to reflect whether Jewish or not. ",
          "I loved it, it was a great piece of our history. But it smelled of gas and burnt bodies. I loved to see all the starving kids and the terror on their face. 10/10 experience",
          "I went on a Thursday and it was free. Very nice and informative. It's quite sad of course but you learn a whole lot more than what schools would cover. ",
          "Ok. I preferred the old Holocaust Museum. It was more personal.",
          "Temporary location, still a very moving experience. The guided tour was touching and informative.",
          "Not original place...very small and not alot to see. Their permanent place is large with lots to see and do",
          "Helped me and my classmates understand alot of what really went down in WWII. With the real life surviers, artifacts, and the awesome tech they have, it was a cool, educational experience.",
          "Very informative",
          "All the information was wonderful to read.  Make sure to allow yourself enough time to be able to read all the information.",
          "Not really something to be happy about, but the museum is very well designed. The exhibits are not for the faint-of-heart, but seem to really capture the horror and depravity of the holocaust. I never knew we had such a great museum for the \u2026",
          "Small, but incredibly well-maintained museum. \n\nThe exhibits are small and close together but provide extreme depth and perspective. \n\nSheds a truly informative and sobering light on a piece of terrible history. ",
          "This is one of the first places I came to visit when I moved to Houston 7 years ago. It is excellent. Please note it is currently not very big, but it is preparing to go a major renovation to make it much larger. I'm not sure of assessiblity during tenovation.",
          "Their temporary location is not worth it. I would wait for the permanent exhibit to open",

          "A complete testimonial of the Holocaust, showing both the terrible things humans did to other humans  and amazing individuals who risked everything to prevent it/help the ones in need. Not pleasant to see but very much needed. ",
          "Great placer to remenber What hate can do yo te people oficina this world",
          "EVERYONE should go here.  See the results of pure evil. When Hitler marched into the the Rhur Valley the world did nothing. When Hitler took Austria the world did nothing. When Hitler took the sudatenland the world did nothing. Evil can and will rise again if we choose to remain silent.",
          "Wait until they are finished moving they had very little artifacts to see.",
          "Rating only because it is not at the same level in it's current temporary location during their growth stage and remodeling. Will definitely go again after the new building is completed.",
          "By the end of it I was offended because they'd chosen to focus on the villains that are dead and gone and completely neglected to mention those that are still with us. Afterward I asked the staff (who acted as though they were all righteous \u2026",

          "Very informative but is concentrated only on the experiences of Jews who later immigrated to U.S. to live in Houston. After having gone to the Holocaust Museum in D.C., I was a little disappointed. Free parking. ",
          "Going through renovation at the moment but the smaller museum is fine.",
          "It was an amazing learning experience. It was also overwhelming, even for a history-nerd doctor (myself) used to blood and gore. I couldn\u2019t shake off the melancholy for about two days after that.",

          "A very humbling and honest portrayal of the Jewish Holocaust during WWII.",
          "It can have disturbing images but they truly show what it was and have this display outside of this boat and train where Nazi's transported Jews. This video clip also leaves an impression of what happened. Best of it...at no charge....you can visit this place.",

        "wiki": "The Menil Collection, located in Neartown Houston, Texas, refers either to a museum that houses the private art collection of founders John de Menil and Dominique de Menil, or to the collection itself of approximately 17,000 paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings, photographs and rare books.While the bulk of the collection is made up of a once-private collection, Menil Foundation, Inc. is a tax-exempt, nonprofit, public charity corporation formed under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Additionally the Menil receives public funds granted by the City of Houston, the State of Texas, and the federal government through the National Endowment for the Arts.The museum's holdings are diverse, including early to mid-twentieth century works of Yves Tanguy, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Max Ernst, Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, among others. The museum also maintains an extensive collection of pop art and contemporary art from Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko, Robert Rauschenberg, Vija Celmins and Cy Twombly, Jr., among others. Also included in the museum's permanent collection are antiquities and works of Byzantine, Medieval and tribal art.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Renzo Piano-designed museum opened to the public in June 1987. It is governed by The Menil Foundation, Incorporated, a non-profit charitable corporation established in 1954 whose stated purpose was to promote understanding and culture, primarily through the arts. Initially, the Foundation also pursued land banking to stabilize the neighborhood surrounding the museum, and structured the administration and operations of the collection. With Dominique de Menil (a member of the Schlumberger family) serving as president, early board members included the Menils' son Francois, daughter Philippa Pellizzi, Malcolm McCorquodale, Edmund Snow Carpenter, Miles Rudolph Glaser, and Mickey Leland. Dominique de Menil ran the museum until her death in December 1997.\n\n\n== Campus and neighborhood ==\nThe museum campus has grown to include two satellite galleries to the main building: Cy Twombly Gallery (also designed by Piano) and The Dan Flavin Installation at Richmond Hall, which houses Dominique de Menil's last commission (a series of three site-specific installations by Dan Flavin that were installed in 1998). Two other buildings founded by the de Menils, but now operating as independent foundations, complete the campus: The Byzantine Fresco Chapel and the Rothko Chapel.\nThe Menil Foundation began buying bungalow style homes in the area in the 1960s, painting each the same shade of gray to establish a commonality. When the museum building was constructed, it was painted what has become known as \"Menil gray\" to coordinate with the bungalows. Though subtle, the result is a neighborhood that feels aesthetically unified.In 2013, the landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh was appointed to enhance and expand the Menil Collection\u2019s 30-acre campus. The master site plan, by David Chipperfield Architects, calls for the creation of additional green space and walkways; a cafe; and new buildings for art.\n\n\n== Admission ==\nThe Menil Collection is open to the public, and admission is free. The Museum is open Wednesday through Sunday 11 am to 7 pm. It is located near the University of St. Thomas in the Neartown area of Houston.\n\n\n=== Rothko Chapel ===\n\nThe Rothko Chapel, built in 1971, is an interfaith chapel commissioned by the de Menils. Each year, it hosts more than 60,000 visitors from as many as 85 countries around the world. The entrance-way contains holy books from various religious traditions that may be used in the chapel. The space is sky-lit, with kneeling mats, prayer benches, and meditation cushions. Fourteen canvases by Russian-born American painter Mark Rothko hang in the interior. The Rothko Chapel is an independent, non-profit organization. In 2001 the Chapel was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It is also a featured entry in National Geographic's book Sacred Places of a Lifetime: 500 of the World's Most Peaceful and Powerful Destinations, published in 2009.South of the entrance is a reflecting pool with the sculpture Broken Obelisk by Barnett Newman, installed in memory of Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n\n=== The Byzantine Fresco Chapel ===\n\nLocated in a separate building near the main collection, the Byzantine Fresco Chapel formerly housed two 13th century Byzantine church frescoes, an apse semi-dome of the Virgin Panagia and a dome featuring a depiction of Christ known as Christ Pantocrator. After having been removed from a church in Lysi in Turkish-occupied North Cyprus by the illegal art trade, they were recovered during the 1980s. According to the museum, they were the only such frescoes in the Americas. They were held at the museum by agreement with their owners, the Church of Cyprus.\nIn September 2011 the Menil Collection announced that the frescoes would be permanently returned to Cyprus in February 2012, an example of art repatriation. In January 2015, the Menil disclosed its plans to reuse the former consecrated chapel space as a site for long-term contemporary installation work. The first exhibition in the reopened space is \"The Infinity Machine,\" a new work commissioned by the Menil by Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller.\n\n\n=== Cy Twombly Pavilion ===\nIn 1992, Renzo Piano was commissioned by Dominique de Menil to build a small, independent pavilion dedicated to the work of Cy Twombly, Jr. in the grounds of the Menil Collection. In contrast to the Menil\u2019s main museum building and the surrounding bungalows, the Cy Twombly Gallery is built of sand-colored block concrete, is square in plan and contains nine galleries. Similar to the main museum, it is lit through the roof, but here with an external canopy of louvers, shading the sloping, hipped glass roof, below which a fabric ceiling diffuses the light, giving a reduced intensity of around 300 lux.\n\n\n=== Menil Drawing Institute ===\nThe planned Menil Drawing Institute, according to the Menil Collection, is the first ground-up building in the United States dedicated to the exhibit, study, storage and conservation of modern and contemporary artworks on paper. Los Angeles-based architecture firm Johnston Marklee and New York-based landscape architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates designed the Drawing Institute. They worked in close collaboration with the New York\u2013based structural engineering firm Guy Nordenson and Associates. Johnston Marklee was selected to design it after winning a competition that also included David Chipperfield, SANAA and Tatiana Bilbao. Rhode Island-based Gilbane Building Company, a subsidiary of Gilbane, Inc., was selected as the general contractor. The opening of the building was delayed by nearly a year to allow for additional testing.The $40-million building, with a total of 30,000 square feet (2,800 square metres) on two floors, one of them below ground, is located near the southern edge of the Menil campus, adjacent to the Cy Twombly Pavilion and north of the Dan Flavin Installation. Modestly scaled, the flat-roofed building tops out at 16 feet (4.9 metres), no taller than the neighboring gray bungalows on the 30-acre campus. Half of its space is for underground storage, while the ground level will contain a large, flexible central living room, about 3,000 square feet (280 square metres) of exhibition space, a scholar's cloister, rooms for seminars and other events, and a conservation lab, all wrapped around three courtyards.\n\n\n== Vandalism ==\nIn June 2012, a museum visitor named Uriel Landeros defaced an original Picasso at the museum, Woman in a Red Armchair, using black spray paint to stencil a bull and the word Conquista on the work of art. The vandal, a self proclaimed artist, said that he did it to make a statement, and did not intend to destroy the painting however Landeros was sentenced to two years in prison. \n\n\n== Management ==\n\n\n=== Menil Foundation ===\nThe museum continues to be governed by the Menil Foundation. The foundation has been solely responsible for acquisition funds, which during the first years averaged more than $1 million annually, and operating disbursements of between $2.7 million and $2.9 million a year. Nearly half of the money for the museum building was derived from outside sources in Houston, in particular the Cullen Foundation and the Brown Foundation, which contributed $5 million each. By 2001, the Menil Foundation's endowment is $200 million. The budget pays for the museum's operation and for exhibitions, research and catalogs.Brown & Root heir Louisa Stude Sarofim has been president of the Menil Collection and Foundation since 1998, following the death of Dominique de Menil. She has since become the museum's largest donor. The Board of Trustees includes, among others, Suzanne Deal Booth.\n\n\n=== Directors ===\nThe museum's first director was Walter Hopps. Before joining the Menil Collection as director in 1983, he had worked with Mrs. de Menil on planning the museum and its program. Between 1999 and 2003, Ned Rifkin served as the museum's director; during his time in office, there were frequent clashes over the museum' direction and whether Rifkin was departing from the vision of its founder. Josef Helfenstein was named director in 2004. Until his departure in 2015, the Menil doubled its annual attendance, increased its endowment by almost 54 percent, and added more than 1,000 works to the collection, including pieces by Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Serra and Kara Walker.\n\n\n=== Curators ===\nMichelle White took up her post at the Menil after honing her skills at Harvard's Fogg Art Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; her endeavors have been as varied as projects with the Houston collective Otabenga Jones & Associates (who aim to \u201cteach the truth to the black youth\") and the Richard Serra drawings retrospective that traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Among others, Flash Art and Modern Painters have published her writings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCharmstone (sculpture)\nIsolated Mass/Circumflex (Number 2) (1968\u20131978)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nByzantine Fresco Chapel official site\nMenil Collection from the Handbook of Texas Online\nCy Twombly Gallery",

          "This was the highlight of our Texas vacation. In fact, we returned the next day to see a few things again. The Fabiola Project was entrancing.",
          "I go to the Menil Collection every couple of months and I am always amazed with the collections they have (such as Rene Magritte, Ernst Max, Picasso, etc). Every few months they have new exhibition and they usually have paintings of surrealists, impressionists, but also have",
          "A gem of a surrealistic collection - wonderful Magritte...which appeals to young and old. Even the youngest art lover can appreciate the humor in some of these paintings.",
          "collection of heirs to Schlumberger fortune. Many early and mid 20th century works such as Magritte, Ernst and Dali. Mark Rothko chapel outstanding. Free.",
          "So The Menil is in itself a modern piece of art. A world class museum, deconstructed. But not the Frank Gehry way. From the point of view of urban impact, The Menil is a series of very distinctive buildings and galleries spread out through the very fabric of the city, tightly",
          "They have a wonderful collection of my favorite artist's (Joseph Cornell) works. The entire collection is solid and it is worth the trip.",
          "The Rothko chapel is interesting, as is the personal collection. The museum lacks good lighting on tiny labels, and signs. The Bistro across the street is very nice.",
          "Mindblowing art collection that is a must see for anyone visiting Houston. Of course you know about the Rothko and Twombly works housed there but there are also Magritte, Dali and Warhol works. Some of the best surrealism style paintings ever created. Do not miss.",
          "The Menil Collection is a splendid museum wth a mix of classic and contemporary art. In a single visit we saw only part of the collection. Alas, we did not have time to return to it, but will surely do so when we return to Houston. Each piece that we saw was choice, a tribute",
          "Beautiful gallery worth seeing the collection and the surrounding area with open parks and restaurants.",
          "They have great exhibits here, and it is free! It's nice to visit during the day when it's almost empty.",
          "I have been visiting The Menil and its beautiful grounds for over 25 years. The museum exhibits a diverse group of artist and their works. Picasso, Matisse, Jackson Pollock, Warhol, Monet, and so many others. I like the architecture of the building and most of all the old",
          "The menil collection is fabulous. I've visited several times and it is outstanding! There is a bistro on property where you can get brunch and then walk to the museum for a perfect afternoon. The surrounding grounds are great for a picnic!",
          "And that isn't really a good thing. I have loved the museum way back then and had a marvelous experience. I was so looking forward to giving same that experience to my husband. But where do I start. How about the darkness. The Surrealism galleries were so dark, the labels were",
          "A wonderful private collection. The special highlight is the Rothko chapel with the Martin Luther King memorial sculpture outside.",
          "I took a friend to the Menil, which is coming up on its 30th birthday, who had never been before. I find the setting of the Menil and its surroundings so peaceful and beautiful. We saw the three current exhibits: The Beginning of Everything: Drawings; Holy Barbarians and",
          "The best way to summarize this: my wife, my mom, and I went for the day. We simply wandered and quietly soaked it all in. When the day was finished, we had dinner and enjoyed two+ hours of amazing conversation regarding the brilliant collections. The Menil is a must for",
          "Wonderful collection of art at all times and plenty of fresh exhibits. You can't go wrong with free either! Loved years ago seeing Andy Warhol's exhibit too! You won't be sorry you visited!!",

          "I have the good fortune to live in a place with several museums and have seen a lot of art over the years. But unquestionably this collection is one of a kind. Many brilliant, (sort of)lessor knows artist that might have one or two pieces in a museum in NYC, London or Paris have",
          "We had heard that this collection was good and so went along. We tried to arrive via public transport which required a fair bit of walking, but it was well worth it. The building was lovely and the collection well displayed.",
          "This is a very clean, contemporary museum housing some of the most unique and very distinct collections ranging from a variety of ages and movement periods. My particular favorite is the Dan Flavin Installation at Richmond Hall. Its simplicity is pure bliss.",
          "Everywhere I visit in the world, I try to visit the city/town's art museums. After visiting more than 40 countries, every time I visit The Menil Collection in my home city of Houston, I can not help but appraise the richness of the collection and feel fortunate to be able to",
          "I guarantee you'll have a good time visiting the Menil. Plan to spend at least an hour or up to 2 or 3, and then get lunch at the cafe across the street. It's free, so feel free to just pop in and go down the road to the Rothko Chapel, or stick around and slowly walk around",
          "I am by no way an art enthusiast, so this gallery was perfect, offered a variety off exhibtions of differing genres.",
          "We love the Menil. It is part of a wonderful inner-city neighborhood. The permanent and special exhibits are always interesting.",
          "This is the largest owned individual collection of art in the U.S. So much diversity, not to be missed and nestled in a quaint neighbor hood",
          "I love this place. The size makes it easy to see everything, and pause and enjoy the art and read the descriptions. I love the breadth of the regular collections, and coming back by to see the new exhibits. The fact that it's free makes it a true gem in Houston's museum scene.",
          "Good collection of art at this lovely small museum. It's very easy to do in an hour and isn't overwhelming like many museums can be. There's a good collection of modern art, and it's FREE! Definitely worth seeing though I didn't see anything that blew my socks off. I recommend",
          "Delightful journey in beauty and tastefully displayed enjoyable and inspirational go on a pretty day and walk there it's just a great must do experience",
          "The Menil Collection is a very \"manageable\" museum that can be enjoyed over a couple of hours. While the collection is much larger than what you see on exhibit, on any particular day, you see small examples of multiple art forms and styles. On our most recent trip, there was an",
          "My wife and I visited here for maybe the second time. The building is beautiful and elegant. It lets in a glow of natural light. So go on a nice sunny day to really enjoy it. The collection is average - but that's considering that it is free. The size is very manageable as well.",
          "Exceeded expectations. I was anticipating a short visit to view a few pieces of modern art. What a nice surprise to find a mix of periods and styles from antiquities to surrealists, the collection has something for nearly everyone. Definitely a worthwhile experience.",
          "My friend and I enjoyed our visit to this museum and to the restaurant! Such interesting displays in multiple rooms inside the museum. Lunch was delicious as well.",
          "The Menil is always a great visit and an interesting discovery. The permanent collection has some great Pacific art from Polynesia, Micronesia, etc. Right near it is the Byzantine Chapel and Rothko Chapel, which make a nice afternoon - we even take a picnic meal and enjoy it",
          "The Menil collection has several galleries of art and archaeological collections. There is one gallery that is for mature audiences, but the rest is pretty family friendly. It's free to enter, and there's a park and green area nearby. While like many galleries, there is no",

          "Great art for free and so you can spend as much time or as little as you want and always get your money's worth. The Bistro Menil north of the museum has wonderful food and a great atmosphere.",
          "We enjoyed the layout and friendly staff. The collections were well organized and thought provoking. We especially loved the Surrealism collection. The Menil is wonderful and Andy Warhol is usually wonderful but the movie was AWFUL. 33 minutes of monotonous poetry watching a",
          "It was certainly worth a visit. A wide-ranging collection of very unusual pieces of art from all over the world - ancient Egyptian, Greek, aboriginal, oriental, modern, pop, etc. It took us only 40 minutes to see all so it wasn't tiring at all.",
          "The Menil is the top of its class in every way. The building is beautiful and the collection could not be displayed better. I especially like the Surrealist, The Modern and Contemporary and the Witnesses sections. There was a Picasso visiting exhibit there when we visited which",
          "One of my favorite art collections in the world housed in a wonderful Renzo Piano building. Do not miss the magical Cy Twombly wing and the Rothko chapel respectively across the street and close by.",
          "I have lived in Houston for 12 years, but never visited Menil. As I am off for a couple of weeks and have a 13 month old daughter, we were looking for some low impact things to do. Yesterday we visited The Menil Collection - it was a beautiful day and perfect for walking around",
          "The standard fare if the Menil is a must, and I very much enjoyed the monographic exhibit, which serves to educate by focusing in on a single artist's progressions/tacit decisions about art-making/ general professional trajectory. I also enjoyed considerably the room devoted to",
          "The Menil Collection makes up for lack of size with the quality of the collection. The emphasis is on modernism, and the gallery sports a surprisingly comprehensive collection of Magrittes along with works by Picasso, Ernst, Leger, Robert Rauschenberg, and others. Special",
          "Wonderful museum complex with amazing art. The main building by Piano is a gem. The Rothko chapel is impressive. The fact that there is no admission fee is all the more impressive. The Bistro had excellent food and was good value for money.",
          "We were in town for a concert and went by the Menil Collection on our way to another attraction. What a great peaceful place in the middle of a fairly ordinary neighborhood. Reminds me some of the new pavilion at the Kimbell Museum, which was also designed by Renzo Piano. The",
          "We loved our visit here.A nice modern structure. Check out their exhibits but I cannot believe that any show there would not be GREAT. Definitely worth the visit. It opens late, at 1100 I believe.",
          "Very interesting collection. Eclectic, diverse. The layout of the space is great, easy to see in a hour. Should have a picnic out on the grass. Beautiful....",
          "A museum made up of a few individual building. Some very interesting modern art. This is a complex dedicated to an unusual collection. One must walk a short distance from one building to another.",
          "I don\u2019t want to steer you wrong. If you\u2019re visiting Houston and only have time for two museums, go to MFA and Natural Science. But, if you can squeeze one more in, make it the Menil Collection. Right now, in addition to its permanent works of art, it has two extraordinary",
          "The Menil Museum is wasted on Texas. This incredibly fine collection of surrealist, postwar and ethnographic art displays the keen and hard-edged eye of Dominique deMenil and would be mobbed if it were anywhere else. The collecting aesthetic would almost be a cliche if the",
          "The Building is world class and the collection is outstanding. It is a must do for taking visitors to Houston, but also fun to just go see.",
          "Being a supporting member of the Menil Museum (full disclosure here) I have to say this is great places for modern art. It might not be to every bodies taste but you should visit. And it is still free entry",

          "what i like about menil is that it is free and has different exhibitions in different seasons. i like the naborhood where it so located called Montrose, which is a good place just to take a walk. i don't recommend this place for children but art lovers will find it worthwhile.",
          "So many people told me to be sure to see this museum, but I was disappointed in the cold uninteresting building, and many of the pieces in the collection. The primative and ancient collections were good, but modern collection was uninspiring. No restaurant but bistro across the",
          "As an avid museum-goer, the Menil has been on my list forever. I finally got to Houston, and I came away from my Menil visit much richer for it. The art, architecture, lighting (all natural), scale of the building\u2026not to mention the adjunct spaces: Rothko Chapel; Dan Flavin",
          "This is a great looking gallery set in park like surroundings. As a legacy to Houston by John and Dominique de Menil one has to be inspired by their vision. Not all the surrealist works of Max Ernst and other are my favourites however the Picasso works are numerous many on",
          "We are not modern art lovers so a lot of the collection didn't appeal to us. We loved the Magrittes and some of the Picassos. The Rothko Chapel was interesting. The collection was presented beautifully and in an intelligent and thoughtful way.",
          "Not a large gallery but with a wide range of attractions. Free to visit. A little difficult to get to via public transport. One downside is that photography is not allowed, which is a bit unusual in the USA.",
          "Beautiful airy building designed by Renzo Piano. The art is extremely well displayed (Menil is world standard). There is now a special exhibit on Picasso The Lines, about 90 of his drawings from start to finish of his life. My favorite room: ethnography used by the surrealists.",
          "I really liked the architecture of the building and felt that it enhanced the viewing of the art pieces. Several of the works were quite interesting and we especially liked the room of artifacts that were inspiration pieces owned by previous artists. However, our visit was not",
          "Wonderful collection, great breadth, but a lot of exhibits are labeled \"African sculpture, wood\" or something similar, as though no effort has gone into discovering the origins of the pieces not commissioned from the artist.",
          "This is a free museum with free parking across the street in a lot near the bistro. The museum has contemporary and surreal art by famous artists: Rene Magritte, Max Ernst, Picasso. There was an interesting temporary exhibit of self taught artists. There is also a collection",
          "Houston has a lot of great museums. This is the best I've been to. I always recommend it for art-loving travelers. Regardless of what's exhibited at any given time, the neighborhood and the building itself are worth learning about and seeing for yourself. Killer collection of",
          "A group of friends and I made reservations for brunch on a July Saturday morning then viewed the Stephanie Smither's folk art exhibit which is amazing! The late Mrs. Smither's took pride in collecting folk art and has donated parts of it to Houston's art world. It's a MUST",
          "but the exhibitions were not as good as they used to be, I had better visits before. It's still great that there are severyl buildings scatterd in the neighborhood, just in case you don't mind going for a stroll. Crazy enough, the museum is for free, only donations.",
          "This intimate museum offering free admission is a personal favorite among all U.S. art museums. Founded on the superb taste of the founders, the Menil remains true to its founders' spirit, imbuing art with spirituality. The scale is modest but the quality is extraordinary. It",

          "We went for the Picasso exhibit and saw so much more. Loved the Magritte. The antiquities are stunning. If you look at etched elk on bone dating to 10000BCE and are not amazed, you aren't breathing. The Chapel, the campus, the foresight and philanthropy of the Menil are a",

          "Having spent several years in New York, we genuinely miss the Met, MoMA, AMNH, the Frick, and Historic Hudson Valley. That said, thus far the Menil Collection comes closest in Texas to our longings for fine art. The modern/contemporary and surrealist collections are probably",
          "I guess I\u2019m of the minority opinion, but I was underwhelmed by this place. Having heard so much about it for years, I was excited to finally visit Houston and head for this art lovers\u2019 shrine. The architecture, despite its tony credentials, felt dated. The collection boasted",
          "I've been here several times and each time I am more impressed than the first which is saying a lot! If you like contemporary art chances are pretty high that you will like the Menil Collection.",
          "There are reasons to see the Menial Foundation - the brilliance of a small but discerning modern and contemporary collection; a thrilling collection of Cycladic figures; a stunning Gaelic head; the Rothko Chapel (oh my!!!); the Cy Twombley building; the Dan Flavin installation;",
          "The Menil has rotating collections as some permanent/semi-permanent fixtures. This is a great place to go when looking to do something during the dog days of summer. There are many eateries in walking distance and a bookstore across the street. I love going to Menil!",
          "The permanent exhibition in the museum is stunning, I especially love the room filled with artifacts the inspired the surrealists. This is very unique and though provoking. Their special exhibits have become interesting again. The cafe is way overpriced and the bookstore should",

          "An extensive collection Surrealist paintings from Magritte, Max Ernst etc. The other side of the museum is devoted to African art, some exceptional pieces. Spend some time on their lawn and in the Cafe too. The whole experience makes for a very calm, soul-filling afternoon.",

          "I love art but not really wild about modern art because most of the time I think, \"I could have done that\"! The Menil Collection is a very nice museum and it's free. They have works by Picasso, Rothko, Matisse, Warhol, and others you would recognize. Even if you aren't into",
          "It is a wonderful place to visit and see a wide variety of great art in a well designed building. Whenever I am in Houston I try to visit this museum. The Rothko chapel is also a great place to see with the art installed in the space it was intended to be.",

          "The Menil has a few rooms, with permanent and special exhibits. I saw Salvador Dal\u00ed with other surrealist painters and also a very daring Willam Copley. You should make sure to go check out the Dan Flavin lights installation and the Rothko Chapel, both outside the main Menil",

          "We took a group tour of the Menil in March and it was amazing. The collection that is available for all to see for free is unbelievable. Afterwards we had a nice lunch at the shop beside of the Menil and it was equally amazing and delicious. Can't wait to bring our visitors",
          "The entire collection is amazing, but the Surrealist section is particularly amazing. Dali, Magritte, Ernst, Miro, Picasso, Bacon, De Chirico ... Amazing.",
          "When myn friends and family from New York, Chicago, or LA come to visit, this is where I take them. The DeMenil truly gives Houston bragging rights, and is a place known all over the art world. The collection of surreal and expressionist painting alone is worth the visit, but",
          "I go here about once a year. There are a few exhibits that have always been there, and a few that rotate. It's not a huge museum, so you can get through it in a few hours, and of course the price is right (free!). The temporary exhibits have astonishing depth. Also drop by",
          "Was recommended by friends I was staying with to visit The Menil Collection, and it happened to be a highlight of my stay in Houston. Beautiful collection, quiet, peaceful, and not too many people. Have highly recommended to my parents who will be visiting Houston for the first",
          "A lovely discovery in Houston which I have been frequenting for a couple of decades now. Paintings and ancient objects beautifully displayed in airy, well-lighted modern surroundings that are extremely interesting and also easy to navigate. It also has photographs and a couple",
          "Amazing that one family collected all this art. Rothko chapel was awe inspiring. Bistro was delicious.",
          "We took a long walk from our house one day and happened to pass by the Menil Collection. It was an unexpected pleasure. An absolutely beautiful collection.",
          "A perfect, leisurely weekday outing in May, included an elegant and reasonably priced lunch outdoors, followed by an hour stroll through this lovely collection.",
          "Interesting mix of edgy and classic art. From Dali to Copley and ancient artifacts. Free parking is available around the museum. Unless you study each piece, an hour here is good enough. It's a nice place, but not a must see unless you want to see a very specific piece of art.",
          "The Menil Collection has a chapel built exclusively for Mark Rothko's works. It is a beautiful setting, very quiet and peaceful. They have a excellent art collection in the main building as well.",
          "The best tranquil, quiet and peaceful visit. It's time for another visit. Walking distance from small neighborhood eats. Perfect in any weather.",
          "Focus on surrealists in beautiful building and location. Well worth a visit. Had a yummy croissant at the restaurant which was served with creme fresh and lemon curd.",
          "Visited the Menil Collection on a stormy day in Houston. Although not a large collection, the objects at the museum are uniquely excllent",
          "I am a local and visit the Menil Collection every year. A must see for locals and visitors. A very unique collection. The environment inside and outside has an energy that must be experienced. The cafe on location, Bistro Menil, highly recommended as well.",
          "The building is astonishing.The collection is a mixed of great pieces and some others brought from different parts of the world where the drillings took place",
          "Any time you go, you find more that you did not see the first time. Exhibits change often. The opening nights of an exhibit are fun however, most crowded. This museum complex is composed of 3 separate buildings. The Bazantine Chapel is now being refitted with a new exhibit.",
          "My children took me on a visit here and I really enjoyed the different artists from a lot of different time periods. It had a lot more to offer than I was expecting.",
          "Wonderful find! Free and very interesting. Such an eclectic collection. I especially enjoyed the very ancient small things. We happened on to one of the last days of a special sonic and visual mobile in the Byzantine Fresco Chapel by artists Janet Cardiff and George Bures",
          "As a Houston native, there are few places I have as a revisit on a regular basis, but the Menil is one. I've loved this place since my school days when I was introduced on a field trip. The amount and type of art available is expansive and the touring exhibits are always",
          "There is quite an eclectic collection here for everybody to enjoy, a mix of different things. Something for everyone then... The place is small, so you cannot be bored during the visit.",
          "The Menil family was very generous to found an excellent museum to show their personal collection. Do not miss.",
          "This is a great museum, always has some great exhibits and I really enjoy the building and grounds very inviting and a fun people watching place as well as the art.",
          "This smaller gallery is easily digestible but has some outstanding pieces, including original Matisse and Picasso. The natural light and indoor greenhouse sections made the inside unique for this kind of museum.",
          "I've been reading about this unique art museum since its inception in the 1970s and finally had reason to be close enough--Galveston--to tack on a few days in Houston and schedule a visit. It's well worth it; in fact, you can't lose as there is no admission fee, although a sign",
          "Hidden gem. Small free art museum hidden in an artsy neighborhood. Beautiful live oaks line the streets surrounding the museum. Very cozy and worth the visit.",
          "There's really nothing like this museum anywhere. A spectacularly gorgeous building, outstanding collection arranged suggestively, the separate Cy Twombly gallery, and the Rothko Chapel. An inspiring, invigorating experience.",
          "I love art, and the Menil Collection is very nice. The Rothco Chapel, however, doesn't really do anything for me. It reflects Rothco's dark period and all the paintings in the Chapel are black.",
          "I spent two hours studying the many paintings at the Menil Collection during my recent trip to Houston. In particular they have two Picaso's and a Savadore Dali on display! The collection is well laid out and accessible. Informative information about each painting.",
          "Many people do not realize how wonderful this museum really is and the Rothco Chapel too. Many, many really hidden treasurers.",
          "Fascinating, huge-size pictures. Its great news for art lovers that Dominique de Menil had the Schlumberger riches at her disposal, because when she picked art, she picked well! Few cities have the resources of the Museum District-area group of small museums of which the Menil",
          "I checked out the Menils during my trip to Houston and fell in love with their extensive surrealist collection. If you're a fan of Magritte, Dali and the other surrealist painters, don't pass up seeing this awesome collection of art, which includes an entire room filled with",
          "The Menil collection just keeps getting better as the years go by. This is a true destination museum that will delight the true art lover. The DeMenil's have given our city an amazing gift. Not only the museum but the park and the Cy Twombly are all within walking distance.",
          "The Menil Collection is a museum displaying art and artifacts including modern art and abstracts as well as carvings and masks from cultures residing in areas prior to the arrival of Europeans. There are many paintings by Max Ernst, a few by Salividor Dali and even a couple by",
          "Very nice exhibit, building is very clean and spacious. When i was there it was not very busy, so sufficient time and room to check out the works of art.",
          "I love Matisse The have lots of Matisse They have deer from 6000 bc They have painting by Indians of the north west They have a Calder mobile The have African carvings They have medieval church art They have Greek pottery that's really old It's a cool place we had 2 wheelchairs",
          "We had just visited the Rothko Chapel and had noticed this other interesting-looking building up the block. When the skies darkened and the rain began to fall, we made a mad dash and got inside. We ended up visiting a couple of the exhibits at this lovely museum. And we learned",
          "So much to see from art exibition stand point. Beautiful collections that will not disappoint collectors. But the story of how it all came into fruition, even more impressive. Going through the surrounding neighborhood and understanding how each of the homes must have an artist",
          "I've been to a lot of places over the years that say no pictures, but I'm not much of a rule follower, so I usually still sneak in a pic or two (with no flash of course). This place however, had a guard/employee around every nook and cranny though, so there was never a chance. I",
          "Being local I go to the Menil all the time. I do suggest to anyone coming to Houston to put this on their list of TO GO places. It's not that far from other galleries and a short drive to the Museum of Fine Arts of Houston. Make it a day of art. The Menil has their permanent",
          "My daughter from Connecticut visits us twice a year and looks forward to going to see the new exhibitions with her brother who lives downtown Houston.",
          "A small but well maintained art museum with many fine works of art by famous artists. The surrealist gallery was especially impressive. Nice variety of ancient and African art, too. Be fore-warned: the William Copley exhibit is not for children",
          "Always interesting, new exhibits year round, great choice for a cultural, relaxing experience in one of the most beautiful building used as museum in the area. And all for free!. If you go, enjoy the surrounding gardens, where you can even ride a bike or enjoy a pinnic and",
          "The William Copley Exhibit at the Menil (Februry 19 to July 24, 2016) is not to be missed. As the first comprehensive exhibit of Copley's work in the United States I was not very familiar with his art. His style is abstract/surreal often cartoonish but very interesting weaving",
          "Beautiful day in the park - love the giant red jack by Jim Love - and the Menil was very busy with musicians and art. We went to see the Secret of the Hanging Egg by Dali, but equally enjoyed the Byzantine and African works. Great Museum.",
          "I'm not big on modern art but this is worth seeing just for the building. The surrounding area is nice also. Be sure to go by the Rothko Chapel and the Menil Bistro.",
          "The Menil Collection was on my list of things to do whilst in Houston for a week and I thought it was a really interesting place to visit and have a look around - could have stayed there all day.",
          "Never a dull moment at the Menil Collection. Wonderful place to begin a day with friends / family or coworkers who love and appreciate art.",
          "This is a fantastic museum and its free! A wonderful place to spend the afternoon. After you can stop by the great Menial cafe and have a coffee or light meal.",
          "I often need to collect my thoughts when I'm in Houston for business or holiday. The Menil Gallery and Rothko Chapel are where I head.",
          "This is actually a collection of several galleries and the Rothko chapel all within easy walking distance - a map is provided. The main gallery is an impressive long high building and houses mainly 20th century paintings along with displays of artefacts covering many cultures",
          "Archeological artifacts especially of the masks were well displayed in well lit rooms. Very accessible.",
          "We wandered up to the Menil Collection as well as the Rothko and the Byzantine Chapel. The Menil Collection is free. No photographs are allowed inside the building. It houses a wide variety of artwork--all very avant grade. Some of it I thought was absolutely wonderful and",
          "Great place to visit. Always have great exhibits and nice location. Located close to St. Thomas University.",
          "There's something quite relaxing about this collection of museums. The artwork itself demands a sophisticated viewer but anyone can stroll along and enjoy the different experiences each museum/chapel offers. Although its inside the Loop it feels like taking a retreat. Nice new",
          "The best art museum in Houston and always free. They have a collection that never changes (~50%) then the other half rotates in either more art owned by the Menil Foundation or works of new and interesting artists. As well as traveling, on loan, exhibitions. To ensure you see",
          "When in Houston, the Menil Collection is a certain stop for me. It's free and not very large. It's well worth the time you spend there. Across the street is an excellent Bistro that serves lunch and dinner and interesting wines and beers. I'm not sure if it's better to see the",
          "An intimate and personal collection I love everything about it! It's free, naturally lighted and full of Man Ray, Magritte, Rauschenberg, northwest Native American and African art. Incredible Cycladic collection as well. Picnic in the park next door and don't miss the Cy",
          "Free. Always a good stop when passing through Houston. The temporary exhibits change frequently enough that you are likely to experience something new with each visit.",
          "This museum space has more world class paintings with a storage space contains more! Go to the internet and be awed. Remember every visit you make will \"set your heart on Fire\"!",
          "Great (free entry) collection, with surrealism, ancient Egyptian and Greece art, Alaska, paintings, sculptures, ... great variety. I was impressed, I'm not a big museum person, but the variety and the unpretentious atmosphere makes it a great place to visit for a rainy afternoon",
          "If you are planning on spending any time visiting museums in Houston you cannot miss the Menil Collection (and by extension the Rothko Chapel next door). I'm not sure which is better; the fact that the menil collection is free or the actual collection itself. If you are",
          "It's always insightful to see a collector's personal taste reflected in their holdings, and the Menil Collection is a superb example of a stunning collection of contemporary art. For me, probably too much surrealism, but I respect that that is their taste, not mine. The",
          "The Menil Collection is one of those really spectacular things that we are so lucky to have in Houston. The art and artifacts are outstanding and the grounds are just lovely. Best of all, it's free! It's a must see for any art lover. I come again and again. I can't wait to",
          "The Collection has paintings by Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko and Salvador Dal\u00ed and much more. There is also physical art by Alexander Calder. The museum's permanent collection has significant collection of archeological art. Park like",
          "The campus, the neighborhood and the collection are all excellent. Be sure visit the separate Cy Twombly and Dan Flavin galleries and the Rothko Chapel. Highest recommendation.",
          "Have been there various times, the setting is nice and always great exhibitions for free! Different types of exhibitions with paintings as well as sculptures, it is definitely a place to visit.",
          "The design of the building shows off the exhibits to their best advantage. The current antiquities exhibition is broad in coverage. However the identification and explanation of the items are minimal. No context is supplied. It is basically an interesting potpourri of items.",
          "We only get to the Menil once a year. But every time we go there is Something that catches my eye. This time it was a Rothko painting that had not gone to the retrospective exhibition at the Fine Arts museum. And there's lots more. It's free. Part of the museum is very",
          "The Menil collection is located in the Museum district. This is bohemian, trendy, safe area in the city. It has a very convenient, free parking area. The museum entrance is for free! It has a lovely collection of surrealism with beautiful paintings and sculptures by Renee",
          "The quality of art work in this hidden gem of a museum is wonderful. We love the Surrealist collection the best, seeing many Rene Magrittes. The other shows were equally as nice.",
          "The Menil Collection is one of my favorites museums in the USA, beautiful building by Renzo Piano. They have great exhibitions and the permanent collection is fantastic. Great!",
          "I definitely recommended this museum for more than two hours! Modern building is design piece in very nice area.",
          "We really enjoyed the exterior and interior of this building . DIverse collections from african art, surrealism, modern, etc. The modern exhibit was our favorite. Nice bookshop across the street and friendly greeters at the museum entrance. Would def. good back . I love the park",
          "Some awesome contemporary art, and great for experiencing art that is... different. A step on the wild side but eye opening to what art can really mean. Side note: if you have a friend who is big into art history bring them along, they might have something to say about the",
          "The Menil Collection is a small museum. It is okay to do as an additional outing but not a solo. The exhibits change frequently. They are well displayed. The artwork is modern and contemporary.",
          "Beautiful space. Fascinating and eclectic collection from ancient artifacts to modern art with an almost homely style of curating. (Think a room full of beautiful nic knacks and Dali paintings). Lovely bistro on campus for a leisurely glass of wine or a full lunch. Love",
          "The collection is first class. The pieces displayed are just amazing. You can do in less than an hour for just the collection, but better to plan a little more time. Must see if you like modern & contemporary art. Or just interested in art, period. Admission is free and the",
          "First, I don't like museums where photos are not allowed and with limited information on these. Applicable here. The surrealist exhibition is amazing, especially the works of Victor Brauner. And the collection from around the world. I am not a huge fan of super modernism so I",
          "The Menil Collection is a delightful surprise very near to the Awesome Museum of Fine Arts Houston. It is nestled in a quiet, tree-shaded neighborhood that belies the magnitude of the art housed inside. The inside is spacious, very open and airy and filled with delightful",
          "I grew up in Houston and never had visited this museum. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The permanent collection is diverse and expansive. The special exhibit was very interesting and no visit is complete without a visit to Rothko Chapel. Parking is a HUGE challenge so if you can",
          "Very interesting exhibit. A great way to enjoy a rainy afternoon. Beautiful grounds and amazing inside. And free, of course my kids didn't let me off that easy when we stopped at the bookstore across the street on our way to the parking lot.",

          "We visited the Menil and we were greeted by a very helpful staff member who gave us information about the exhibits and other sites nearby. The collection tends toward the contemporary with some ancient artifacts and a great collection of surreal art. There is an interesting",
          "The Menil is a Houston icon. This clean, well manage museum offers rotating exhibitions from prehistoric to contemporary. We enjoy the Menil every year or two for a relaxed, \"artistic\" afternoon.",
          "If one only has a few days in Houston, then The Menil Collection must be part of your excursion. It's free. It's a collection of artwork put together by Dominque De Menil over her lifetime of travels. She befriended surrealists, abstract expressionists, minimalists. Some of",
          "The Menil has extensive holdings of works by Ernst,Magritte,and Brauner and renowned for its collection of surrealist art..The day we went they had on loan The Eggs on the Plate without the Plate by Dali which was phenomenal.Nearby are the Rothko Capel and the Obelisk statue",
          "I love this place. Beyond the world-class art collection, it has a peaceful vibe about it. I feel good when I go there. My favorite part, however, is the room that houses the items that the surrealist artists collected. It is so fascinating. There is a little information",
          "When in Houston, I adore visiting The Menil Collection. I love the space, the collection, the atmosphere there. It is one of the nicest museums in the country, in my opinion.",
          "Spent a couple of hours viewing the collection, walking the grounds and visiting the chapel. Beautiful property, modern art and a cafe too where we had lunch.",
          "The Mentil Collection houses beautiful works of art. Some permanent, some rotating. I went and saw some Salvdor Dali, Andy Warhol, and Man Ray on display (wow!). I saw a lot of diversity in the exhibits, like the surrealism exhibit. Staff was friendly when I asked questions.",
          "Houston is very lucky to have a museum and an organization such as the Menil Art Organization. Simply great from the Renzo Piano designed building to the Rothko paintings inside.",
          "The Menil is easily Houston's classiest museum. It's size is deceptive. It is actually huge and houses carefully chosen exhibits. Make it a definite stop on your Houston vacation. If you must go to one museum in Houston (which hosts quite a fair number of excellent museums),",
          "For 20+ years now I've enjoyed stopping at the Rothko Chapel (which is close to the Menil but not exactly next door). A couple years ago I \"discovered\" the Flavin light display in the converted grocery store a couple blocks from the Menil. This past Thanksgiving weekend I",
          "It is one of my favorite museums, not just in Houston. The collection, the building, the neighbourhood. A must see when in Houston. There is also a wonderful bistro across the street. The Cy Twombly collection/museum, which housed in another building next to the Menil, is",
          "Another fantastic art space in Houston. Free. Check opening hours and programs. Small venue, won't take too much time to enjoy. Allow some time to park, so.etimes their lots full and you must steet park, read signs carefully.",

          "This museum houses the private collection of the de Menil's, famed for their philanthropy and support of avant garde artists. It features an outstanding selection of Surrealist works (Max Ernst, Rene Magritte, etc.), a very strong collection of 20th century American paintings",
          "Most interesting museum in Houston is also free and because the floors are wooden easy to walk through. Usually there are exhibits which will challenge most visitors and the permanent collection is one of the finest in the world.",
          "The Menil Collection is amazing. Many great paintings, entry is free. Also on the same campus is the Rothko Chapel - beautifully done, very serene. A must see. The Menil's - Domique de Menil and her husband, John de Menil met in Paris in 1930. Then they settled in Houston. The",
          "A much larger private art collection than I expected, with free admission. Grounds provide a very peaceful setting.",

          "Loved the building and the Rothko chapel next door and the fabulous art gallery across the car park as well as the restaurant. Lots of average modern art pieces but the ancient pottery and figurines were well worh the visit as were ther Warhols on display.",

          "It has a wide range - from Picasso to Paul Klee in paintings to very modern abstract art. There are art works, masks and sculptures from Africa and many small islands. There are wonderful \"artworks\" outside the main building too. I loved \"The infinity machine\" and the Rothko",

          "The Menil gallery houses a substantial group of widely varying art including rubbings, Arctic art, contemporary art including a couple of Ptcasso paintings And some rather funky collectibles. For the free price, it is worth a stop.",
          "Magnificent and large collection of Magritte. For Cy Twombley fans, a large collection in a space created just for his works. Well worth visiting for diverse collection of modern art in many forms.",

          "Excellent museum, even though small. The indigenous artwork(my fave) is outstanding and the art of ancient civilizations just a step behind(probably due to my personal preference). The wall of masks at the entry really catches my eye. The surrealism exhibit is good-do not miss",

          "My favorite area was the surrealism room. My son's favorite room (he is 15 and had no interest in the other rooms) was the room with the artifacts in it. There were some areas of the museum that just didn't appeal to me like the modern art room. I don't really understand huge",

Unfortunately they don't let you take pictures, but the collection is very much worth seeing. It's also free, which is a huge plus.",

          "Very nice collections..a must see",
          "It was nice. You make a donation for your entry. You can not take pictures of most of the art. I wish they would have the more adult content separate from where the children tour. Some art is obviously politically motivated but you have to study it to notice...",
          "Great pieces of art. The area around it is really nice. You can just enjoy walking around the park and campus.",
          "I love this place! It is half the size of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, but it encompasses everything the makes a true museum/art gallery. They have art from all corners of our world to fit every mood and style. The atmosphere is \u2026",

          "Anyone who is giving strong 1 star ratings is a bit too emotional.  Let\u2019s start with the easy 5-star - this museum is free providing access to contemporary masters that most other galleries would charge for.   The collection also contains \u2026",

          "The facility is nice and extremely clean. Some of the staff is very aggressive about where you stand. They run over and ask you not to lean over a line. You are not allowed to take pix of the displays but if you have your phone in your hand...some assume you are taking pix. I was simply just doing a Facebook check in.",
          "Many different styles and artists and entrance for free. Nice staff and interesting visit for a couple of hours.",

          "One of my favorite galleries anywhere. Just the right size too.",
          "While I am not a fan of abstract art, the Menil features a grand variety of artwork, with quality paintings. It is quiet inside, and is one of the best museums in Houston.",

          "I didn't realize that viewing Menil Collection was always free until we arrived! It's absolutely amazing to have a place of art and culture that's accessible to everyone. Be sure to read the little pamphlets and ask questions about the weird or \"ugly\"pieces  it makes the experience more interesting.",
          "A fun collection, some interactive. I will be going back to see the dissection machine. It apparently works at 12:15 each Saturday for 2 minutes.",
          "I mean, you get to see Warhols and Picassos for free. Friendly staff. Security may seem a bit overbearing, but googling the Collection's issues in the past will help id why they're a bit more cautious",
          "Beautiful and FREE! Loved seeing the ancient Turkish and Egyptian pieces. To stand in front of items that are 2-3,000 years old is amazing! I do wish photography was allowed!",
          "I absolutely loved this collection. I came here with a group for a college project but what an interesting gallery. The art district is wonderful and I love the scope of designs here. There really are some abstract ideas. It\u2019s also a very \u2026",
          "It was a little chaotic tbh. Recommend avoid going on busy days if you have children.  Also the information on art was hard to read/ not there OR just very hard to find.",
          "It's a wonderful museum. When we visited they had pieces by Picasso, Gris, Mir\u00f3, Jackson Pollock, Georgia O'Keefe, and more - all for free to the public! Aside from the main building, there's also a Drawing Institute, the Cy Twombil \u2026",

          "This museum architect is blending the nature light and green garden with its collections very well. The neighborhood house is also blended very well with this museum. They change collection display often so I always feel fresh each time \u2026",

          "Kind of boring.  Little to no close parking available.",
          "There seems to be at least three-to-four collections of art present, some rotating every few months or so. It is always free admissions, and every-time I see and learn something new about the Surrealist genre that I didn't know before. I am glad that this extensive collection is housed in Houston.",
          "This isn't the most exquisite collection but it got some really great pieces to see. Admission is usually free so that a huge plus. Overall I suggest this as a good place to go for a cheap date that invites a more subtle touch to your life. \u2026",

          "Like the founder of the \"museum\" said, it is more like a gigantic personal art collection. It seems like the things are displayed in haphazard manner but that is the charm of this spot. Free admission, and great place to visit. Personally, I think it is better than Houston Art.",
          "My favorite museum in Houston!  Beautiful park too!",
          "Couldn't stay to see all.collections. I love the mentality of the Menil family and what their collections mean in the context of social justice and cultural harmonies. Went to the Rothko Chapel nearby which they financed. Don't miss that! Powerful expetience.",
          "Amazing rotating collections! Warhol, Mondrian, van Gogh, Magritte, Dali, Pollak, Picasso, Monet, the list goes on... The building itself is a work of art, with louvered ceilings that let in natural light, an atrium, and simply an amazing \u2026",
          "Excellent atmosphere for quiet and thoughtful contemplation of art.",
          "Out of all of the galleries here in Houston, the Menil is an all-time favorite. With an extensive African  and historical collection as well as surrealist section, the gallery offers art which you can realize something new every time you visit.\n\nIt's revolving space offers wonderful contemporary works as well.",
          "I like the Australian Aboriginal dreaming art.",
          "I absolutely love the Menil because of the top quality art it brings at a publicly accessible level. Could not ask for a better experience. It's amazing that you can see works by contemporary artists, along with Dali and Kahlo just to name \u2026",
          "Just a lovely experience.",
          "I truly love this museum/gallery and take all my out of town visitors. You can get up close and personal with the art and take all the time you want. Even though it\u2019s free I always make a donation. Be sure to visit not only the main building but the Twombly building just behind. Looking forward to the reopening on Sept 22..",

          "They followed me and a friend of mine the whole time and constantly told us to not go near the artwork, looked at us constantly as if we were committing a crime, and some of the \u201cart\u201d they have in there could be made by a child. DO NOT COME HERE",

          "Is good.",
          "One of the best private collections of modern art and art that inspired modern art anywhere. The Rothco chapel is a meditative mecca.",
          "The art gallery takes up a whole city block. It's easy to find an easy to see from the Main Street. The building looks really cool. The grounds are large and have interesting artwork around outside. Large trees. The roads are a little bumpy around building. It was my first time here and I enjoyed it. I recommend it to anyone.",
          "Closed when I finally found it in a regular neighborhood; no parking; auxiliary museums, Rothko Chapel, Byzantine Chapel closed for restoration",

        "wiki": "The Beer Can House is a folk art house in Rice Military, Houston, Texas, covered with beer cans, bottles, and other beer paraphernalia.\nHoustonian John Milkovisch worked through the late 1960s to transform his Houston home at 222 Malone Street into the Beer Can House. The Beer Can House is now one of Houston's most recognizable folk art icons. It is covered with flattened beer cans, bottle caps, bottles, and other beer ephemera. The house is estimated to include over 50,000 beer cans.Milkovisch started his project in 1968 inlaying thousands of marbles, rocks, brass figures and metal pieces in concrete blocks and redwood, all of which were used to make patios, fences, flower boxes, and an array of other items. The result was a yard with no grass, as the entire front and back yards were  covered with cement. When asked why he did it, John simply answered, \"I got sick of mowing the grass.\"\nToday, the Beer Can House is owned and operated by The Orange Show Center for Visionary Art,  a non-profit organization founded in 1980 to preserve and present works of extraordinary imagination and provide people the opportunity to express personal artistic vision.\nOn March 2004, John Milkovisch was named Man of the Week on Spike TV. In 2010 comedy news site Cracked.com said, \"if there's ever a vote on who the awesomest guy ever was, John Milkovisch ought to at least be on the ballot.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of public art in Houston\nTin can wall\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBeer Can House official site",

          "Easy to get there, an available parking place was available right in front of it. I must admit, it's quite a piece of art.",
          "I first went to 222 Malone in 1969, when the house was not surrounded by 3-storey cubist urban hip monstrosities. It had side yard and airspace and trees. It became a favorite place to show visitors to Houston over the next generation. I've been inside the house, the back",
          "This little house is really an experience. Fun for the kids too! From beer can labels to pop-top tabs, nothing was spared in this creative piece of art.",
          "I quite enjoyed this little unusual spot in Houston, i was happy to contribute to look around and did enjoy reading all about it. I would suggest a visit if you have some spare time",
          "With not much seeming to do in Houston we decided to check out the beer can house. This was completely random house in a regular suburban street made of beer cans. I wouldn\u2019t make a special trip there but we had some free time to kill so it was good for 10 minutes of laughs at",
          "Texas has no zoning laws and a tourist attraction is born. At $10 a piece and a 30 minutes look around the house. I got my money's worth. Friendly staff and a clean bathroom too.",
          "This \"attraction\" has been around a long, long time and frankly has seen its better days. Everything is faded and looks bad...its gone from an interesting thing to drive by and see to an neighborhood eye sore.",
          "We were there in the middle of a weekday, so I guess the owners have day jobs (weird to think what those might be, that they come home to a house made of beer cans) but it was enough to get a view from outside. The beer cans were used in different ways - whole, or flattened, or",
          "I lived in Houston for four years (I left in 2016), and I tried (a few times) to visit the Beer Can House but it never worked out! This past weekend, I met a friend of mine in Houston for a weekend of art and food, Houston-style. I knew I wanted to FINALLY check out the Beer Can",

          "You can pay a $5 fee to go inside the house, which is kind of like a musuem with a ten-minute video about the family and the house. The gift shop has several items available for purchase. It is an oddity just to stop and see, in a neighborhood, so not many people who live in",
          "This is not to be missed. Located right off Washington, it is a place you can drive by and be in awe. It's also Free to look at from the street. So drive by there and see this unique work-of-art.",
          "We didn\u2019t go inside, but we stopped by the house to take a look at it. Very interesting to see. Just something quick to do while doing other things in Houston. Street side parking, but it\u2019s easy to find a spot.",
          "Unique structure. Cans have faded over time. There is a five dollar fee to enter the house. The fencing is also beer cans. Malone Street is in a residential area. Limited parking.",
          "We stopped by but didn\u2019t pay for the tour. If you are in the area it\u2019s worth driving by. It\u2019s amazing this is in the middle of a nice neighborhood.",
          "30 min tops, $5 per person to come inside. (nothing for outside) Good for adults, boring for younger children Inside there's not much in terms of beer can decoration, but I'm happy to help keep a place like this from being bulldozed.",
          "I would definitely recommend visiting the house, whether you take the full tour or just look around the property it is pretty cool to see what all was done.",
          "Worth seeing, my wife and I enjoyed the tour. The history of this man's project was very interesting Recommend taking it in when in the area.",
          "At the time of our visit the Beer can house was closed, but to be honest I doubt I'd enter even if it was open. As I saw on TA pics the interior is not that unusual. Apart from that, the facade and fence made entirely of beer cans is very unusual and never seen. But, all that",
          "Not sure what it is about hot climates and religious, outsiderist folk art bordering on hobby as self medication for OCD, but they aren't all out in the desert, Houston has its fair share and the beer can house is one of them. Ignoring the frustration of having to park in the",

          "We just drove by this location and stopped for a few photos. It is on a residential street next to other houses. The house is decorated with beer cans not built out of beer cans as I had thought",
          "Many years ago, when I was a young man, new to Houston, as I spent part of a Saturday wandering around aimlessly on my bicycle, I encountered this oddity at 222 Malone Street. An odd-looking old guy with rather long white hair and a beard to match was standing in the driveway.",
          "I know of no plans to do that, but this little treasure is unique, quirky and a fun place to visit. Add it to a trip to Bayou Bend or Memorial Park. Or the other way around.",
          "A fun stop to see a neat house stuck in time. Worth a quick stop. Easy to find. The staff is friendly. $5 to tour the inside and see memorabilia. Loved seeing the before & after pictures inside.",
          "Looks very neat online but its not much to see. The yard needs some attention, and the inside is pretty bare. Don't waste your money on a tour. Just take a look at the outside and be on your way.",
          "My husband and I were looking for free attractions to go to one weekday and stumbled upon the Beer Can House. It was actually impressive. We took a few pictures and admired the work and were only there for a few minutes. I would love to go back when it was open though! Also,",
          "Surprised my husband with a visit to the Beer Can House. I thought it was an oddity, and that he would get a kick out of it. We did not call ahead, so we didn't do the tour. We just parked on the street and walked in front of it. We spent about 10-15 minutes out front admiring",
          "It's interesting, but it's basically just a house made of beer cans. Just drove up and looked at it. Nothing else.",
          "Passed by and saw it from the street. Very interesting to look at. We did not get down to get any pictures. I'm not sure if you are supposed to get down. Very interesting to look at. Kids thought it was cool.",
          "If you are in the neighborhood it will be nice to stop by the house and to check it out. If you are interested in the modern and alternate arts, you might also want to come inside ($5) for a quick visit. But I wouldn\u2019t come from far away just to see the house. This house was",
          "So much fun!! We learned so much about beer cans. The story of the house is so sweet! I don\u2019t want to wreck the story so go and see for yourself! I would recommend this tour and the tour guides were so nice! Impressed!",
          "So this is the opposite of lifestyles of the rich and famous, but it\u2019s a great for those looking for something unique. The house on the exterior is covered with aluminum beer cans. Hey a take on aluminum siding. If you just stay on the outside there is no charge. You will pay a",
          "This is for imaginative, not yet jaded travelers. There doesn't need to be a reason for bizarre. Just immerse yourself in one of Houston's super funky spaces.",
          "We did a quick stop to see this house covered in beer cans. It was pretty easy to find after we drove through Memorial Park to get there. It was surrounded on all three sides with newer homes so it was good to see that it was still there. I just parked on the street across",
          "Won't be to everyone's taste, but if you're driving by you'll no doubt want to stop and have a look. It looks a little old and dirty from the outside but it was closed when we passed by and it would be interesting to see if the eccentricity of the owner was continued inside.",
          "This is worth a visit - even if you just check it out from the pavement. Incredible to imagine the effort that went into this. You can go inside for a small fee.",
          "You can pay a small fee to go inside, or you can admire for free from the outside.The stone steps and walkways have marbles inlaid. The house itself is gorgeous. Others may not use the word...but it's not about the beer cans and pops tops themselves, it's about the time and",
          "If you're in the area it is worth a stop as it is not every day you get to see a house covered in beer cans but I wouldn't make a special trip. Interesting and different.",
          "How many other beer can houses will you ever see? If you are a fan of kitschy folk art, like beer, or simply have a good sense of humor, this little house will be a delightful visit.",
          "The Beer Can House created by John Milkovisch from 1968 to 1988. At the site of the Orange Show Center for Visionary Art open 12pm-5pm Sat/Sun, admission $5.00 children 12 and under free. We didn't go into the center just took pictures and admired from the outside.It's amazing",
          "Was sceptical at first but once we saw it.... Wonderful piece of recycled artwork and all from beer cans.",
          "Just pulled up outside the house to have a look, didn't have time to actually visit. Maybe next time but there is a small charge.",
          "This is a quirky but fun place to visit. Won't take very long, but you'll gain insight into what a man with an odd hobby can do over a lifetime of beer-drinking!",
          "Everyone who visits me is taken to the Beer Can House! For many years, this unique property elicits laughs, jokes, but always PHOTOS!",

          "I have been going by this house since the 1970's. Roznoski's Hamburger place is nearby! It is truly an amazing house!",
          "For $5 you can\u2019t go wrong! This cute, quirky house has a great story and it worth a quick stop. We had a tour round which was quick and informative and is certainly a place which makes your heart smile!",
          "Didn't go on a tour but it was very fun to experience the Beer Can House. Everything is made out of beer cans; the fences, the sidewalk, the mailbox, the curtains. Was watching a baseball game a few months later and it was featured as things you must see in Houston. Totally",
          "If you take the tour, you will learn about how this house came to be. This was a normal couple who raised their family then things changed after retirement. The husband was a collector of beer cans and a tinkerer. He was a man after my own dads heart. Let\u2019s come up with",
          "Visited this place for years whenever I have guests from out of town. Of course it was much better in the \"old days\", before all of the construction around it...but it is still a marvel, knowing someone actually took the time to create this! Definitely worth seeing!",
          "We arrived about 11.00am and the sign showed that opens at 12.00 Should have checked the website. My mistake. From the outside it looks very interesting and wondered if the maker drank that much beer. Showed to have taken 20 years to complete. House sits in the middle of",
          "Really cool place to check out if you are looking for something unique. The house is small but all the beer cans make it something to marvel at. The staff on site was also very informative and nice. I would check their online site to make sure you go when they are open. Photos",
          "It was interesting, but not too exciting, They take donations to walk onto the property (your choice on amount), and asked $5 each if we wanted to tour inside. I was not too impressed with the outside, so we did not go inside. The entire visit took just a few minutes.",
          "The Beer Can House is one of the most unique homes you'll likely ever see. Constructed exclusively from beer cans... we'll just say it sticks out like a sore thumb. You should check it out if you like things that are a bit 'outside the box'. I enjoyed it.",
          "Intriguing house to stop and learn how one man could think of siding the house with beer cans and decor. We stopped around 3:30PM on Saturday, August 12,2017. We walked around outside before stepping inside to view the short video and tour the inside. Prefect stop for seeing an",
          "One of the most unique sights in Houston. If you go during correct hours, you can get on the property and go in the backyard and even inside. There's something to see around every corner!",
          "The outside of the house and grounds are very neat to see. The cost was $5 a person to go inside the home. There wasn't a lot to see but there were some displays and informative books, also some art original to the home. It is just basically an older home on the inside without",
          "Stopped by to visit but they were closed on the day we visited. A neighbor was walking by and offered to take a photo of the two of us in front of it. That was a really friendly gesture.",
          "This was a really neat house with a wonderful history. I enjoyed looking at some of the older beer cans that weren't from my era. It's a cool place to have a little fun and learn something in the process. I'd go again if in the area.",
          "As we took Texas in on our adventure to visit all 48 continental states and collect beer caps along the way, this was a must stop. The tour guide was knowledgable, passionate and spoke to what each person was interested in. A very unique and fun place to explore.",
          "Old home in RIce Military where the owner used every bit of a beer can and the wrappings. They ae tours. Fun spot!",
          "No idea why this household thought this was a good idea. If you're in the are, stop by. Not really worth going out of your way to see.",
          "This is a cool thing to see. No one ever believes us when we say lets cruise by the Been Can House on our way into town. Got to see it!",
          "Certainly a sight to behold, if in the area. An example of one families creative expression. Think of all the energy put forth to collect and repurpose so many beer cans! Good dining establishments in area- another reason to visit locality.",
          "We rode our bikes along the pathways and decided to stop by here. Didn't realize they offer tours from 9-5. Might be interesting to see inside. I wouldn't go out of your way to see it but if you are in the area it is worth the 5 minute stop!",
          "Love passing the beer can house; being a Native Houstonian, I have seen it so many times, yet, when we are in the area, on our way to one of the great eateries nearby,such as Laurenzo's(prime rib quesadillas!) on Washington, Federal Grill, or El Rey Taqueria, I still exclaim",
          "I have heard of this house but didn't think out going for a visit until it was included in a scavenger hunt during a birthday celebration. Having lived in Houston all my life, I never thought to day trip over here but so glad I did. Q was our tour guide and he was by himself",
          "It was a cool place to visit. It's only open on the weekends. It was cool to take pictures of and see all the time that went into making this house. I'm glad they have left it as a piece of art. Really cool place to see. Only takes a few minutes.",
          "Condos are being built all around this house, but they have decided to keep it where it is. It is a unique little house completely decorated with beer cans. A 5-10 minute visit is all you need.",

          "OK if you have never seen it, Ho Hum otherwise, definitely built by someone who had way too much time on their hands.........",
          "Very creative to use beer cans to side a house and use the lid to create shades and wind chimes. We did take the tour with the guide. Very informative.",
          "The Sunday I visited the Beer Can House, it was closed due to inclement weather, but is usually open Saturdays and Sundays for visitors. I was still able to park out front and slowly walk the sidewalk out front. This home is wonderfully weird. From the sidewalk, you can see many",
          "Someone's personal obsession, and I can respect that, but it seems to me that if you're looking to do a thing no one else has ever done, you might give a thought to why not. I can't help thinking this is basically some good-natured trolling of the art world here. It's a",
          "Neither the Orange Show or the beer can house do anything for me that make me want to move on. I know a lot of work went into these folks art obsessions but as I don't think much of the results I can't recommend them. I have friends who think ever visitor should be driven by y",
          "They call it a beer can house but it's not really made out of beer cans. The owner just simple hung hundreds (it may be thousands but at this point does it matter?) of chains made out of the tops of beer cans. Throughout the years they have added a couple of new things featuring",

          "We stopped here but did not have time to take the actual tour. The house is in a nice neighborhood and was created over 20 years according to the sign. As advertised everything is covered in beer cans. Many of the beer cans colors have faded due to weather but you can still",

          "When googling places to see in Houston, this was on my list. This is located back in the middle of a neighborhood, but worth mapping in. This impressive house is covered in tin cans (we spotted more than 1 7up can :) Very fun to see, they offer tours daily (we didn't go inside.)",
          "This is an icon in Houston, tucked in the middle of a normal neighborhood. It's amazing to see the exterior of an entire house decorated with beer cans. There is a paid tour but it's not necessary to appreciate the art. However, donations do help maintain the house so I",

          "Made this a quick stop on our way to lunch...Very cool to see sandwiched in- between the usual sticks and bricks houses. The story behind it is really interesting if you do some research and it doesn't take much time to find it in it's quiet little neighborhood. Snap a picture",
          "Houston has a delightful variety of museum venues. This is clearly toward the campy end of that broad spectrum--somewhere near the Orange Show, and pretty distant from the Holocaust Museum, the Rothko Chapel or the Menil Collection. If you care about reviews, the Beer Can",
          "I lived in Houston for two years before visiting this attraction! It was well done, only cost a small amount to go inside the house and free to walk around the outside. The young men that were working in the office were helpful and informative, a great little stop when looking",

          "Just do it when you get a chance. It is one of the most unusual things a tourist needs to take in on their travels. It will put the energy back that gets drained when traveling. You only have to stay a few minutes. It is what it says it is. But, it is really fun for the",

          "This is a must see! Once husband and wife, beer lovers. dedicated themselves to decorating their house with every can and every bottle of beer the drank! take the tour! The story of these people is amazing! oh!! and the inside of the house! you are in for a treat!",
          "worth seeing how much time it must have taken to create this place, lots of labor must have gone into it, not the 8th wonder of the world but worth the time to see",
          "Nothing really interesting as we glanced from the outside. A curiosity. Just not our kind of ibtersting things.",
          "Cleaver, bizarre house! Everyone should at least see this. Can only see outside of house and no literature to tell you anything about it. Just something to see. A neat little side trip while exploring Houston sites.",
          "A novelty but that's about it. Someone with nothing to do built it. Shouln't have wasted the time to see it but I had nothing to do. Don't waste the time trying to park on the street and paying money to go inside. Drive by or walk by and you can see all that there is to see.",
          "This was very cool to see but it certainly does not take up very long time to see it. It was closed for tours when we visited.",
          "The Beer Can House is definitely a unique attraction in Houston, but unless you pay to go on the tour, it's really not much more than a 5-10 minute stop to just see what it looks like up close and in person. Parking is challenging, so if you see a spot on the street that is",
          "I'd seen this on TV plenty of times, as Houston is the home to many works of art. This house is completely covered in been cans and while they doesn't sound real amazing and maybe it's not, it just show something that you've never seen before, something different is always fun",
          "I like quirky architecture and folk art. This site combines both, a beer can house, wow. I won't tell the story here, it's already on line. Just go see it, these places are not franchises, they are real and unique.",

          "Just took some friends here, including a 13-year-old boy, and they couldn't believe their eyes. Didn't go in, just looked around from outside the gate. It's an amazing testament to one man's determination- and vision - of what's possible using beer cans. Worth a look if you're",
          "I can assure you that you've never seen anything like this place. The house is covered in beer cans and pull tabs. It's not too far from downtown. I didn't pay to take the inside tour, but just taking photos of the outside pleased my out of town guests.",

          "Interesting part of local history. Where else could you find a house covered in beer cans? Sounds nice when there's a breeze!",
          "I would definitely say this is worth driving past if you happen to be nearby and have time to kill. It is somewhat of a Houston tradition to see this crazy little house. I would not make this a destination in any way, and I don't even know if exiting the car is worth it, but its",
          "Definitely bring your camera! My daughter and grandson visited here. I wouldn't have thought to take a pre-teen here but he was intrigued by the methods used to decorate this house. It was fun to see all the different beer cans used. Very unique outing!",
          "This is a drive by exhibit. Not sure why someone would do this but if you are visiting Houston and have time to go by the house you can have some funny pictures to show your friends. When my kids were teenagers they thought this place was the BOMB (boys)",
          "This is a novelty, certainly, built over the course of twenty years, so maybe one person or household drank all these cans?? It's fun to see, at least from the outside.",
          "It is an amazing piece of art to take a look at. The place doesn't seem to be a lot people though. Go during the day time to get a good glimpse.",
          "This is a unique little place. I honestly wanted to stop just for the sake of stopping. It was a cool place and I'll take my kids next time.",
          "We found this on the Roadside America app. They have fun quirky things around you as you travel. We were not there when they were open but it was still fun to see!",
          "This house and the history behind it is truly unique. My husband and I stopped by one evening after work. It is worth seeing!",

          "Visited on a beautiful Saturday in Feb with son, daughter in law and two grandchildren 8 and 10. Park where you can in this neighborhood. No specified parking, but we found a spot within a block away. You can take self guided tour or a guided tour for same price $5. Kids free",
          "This was a very interesting visit, but we opted for the tour guide who accompanied us - for an extra fee. Otherwise, it would be just so-so.",
          "This house is a ole of a kind experience. Original owner saved beer cans and plastered the outside of his house with them.",
          "Really cool place to zip past if you're in the area! Go early- there's plenty of street parking available and no one around, so you can easily snap pics in front of the house!",
          "So not a destination in and of itself, but surely a testament to the uniqueness in us all.Borderline whether it's worth paying the cost of admission but it does explain the place in more detail.",

          "I have been driving by here for years to show friends and out of town visitors, but you had to just look from the street. Now, you can buy a ticket and see the backyard and tour the inside of the house. The kitchen is pretty much intact the way it was left, the rest of the house",
          "Are you kidding me? Ok, some nut decided to use a lot of beer cans for the exterior cladding of a house. Do not, repeat do not go one minute out of your way to see this.",
          "Great guys who are friendly and knowledgeable preserving an interesting.....well no better way to describe it than as an art installation. If you go when it's closed you'll miss the history and much of the work that went in to it.",
          "Dropped by on the way out of town, glad we didn't make a special visit but worth a quick look just for interest and a photo. Looks quite cool, stuck in the middle of a lot more normal stuff. Wouldn't plan to spend any time there, but worth stopping by for the quirky holiday",

          "We were in Houston for vacation and had a little bit of time to kill, so our server at lunch suggested we come by there Beer Can House. I had already read about it on TripAdvisor, but it was close to where we were going, so we stopped by. It was off-hours, so we didn't get to",
          "I probably wouldn't go out of my way to check out this house.... However, its not far from The Water Wall and as the title states... it's pretty cool so go check it out yourself! Btw, there's a $5 charge to actually go in past the front gate!",
          "The place is interesting but I wouldn't call it an attraction... our little one found it amusing but I would happily not have to pay for the admission...",

          "Looking to kill some time while in Houston? This is a great quirky attraction. I don't think the place is really built with beer cans but it is certainly decorated with them. Stop by, snap a few photos, and be on your way. A true testiment to Texas' zoning laws (or lack there",

          "I enjoyed going to the Beer Can House. I was unaware that you could tour it, until we got there. And since it wasn't operating that day, we didn't tour it. It was just interesting to see the house. I mean why did someone build a house completely out of beer cans? It's just so",
          "The house was small and on a random residential street, you can't miss it though. The people there told us to take time and notice the details which was a good tip there were lil details everywhere! Kind of made you laugh when the guy who created it had no rhyme or reason",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect when stopping by this place but I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, once you get a closer look at the house you realize that this guy spent a ton of time on his piece of art. There are details to observe throughout the property and worth the",

          "not sure I could live next door to it, as the can tops were swinging and clattering around in the wind when I visited. It was not 'open' as such but not sure that really made a difference as you get the idea pretty quickly from a few feet away. Believe I saw this on an English",

          "This is a neat place to see. We didn't take the tour but it was neat to just drive by and look at. I mean how often do you see a beer can house?",
          "We live in Houston and found this place on a local website. It's in a neighborhood surrounded by other homes. You can park on the street and pay your fee in the small garage building at the end of the driveway. The guy that took our money gave us a personal tour of the outside",
          "Wasnt all that appealing. You can totally skip this. Takes like 3 minutes to look at. Thought it sounded more interesting that it really was",
          "Unique and extraordinary - definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. What made him think of doing this I have no idea but he has left an interesting legacy.",
          "I just needed something to do for a few hours and been wanting to see this house.. It's in a nice neighborhood so dont be scared to take the trip out that way to check it out,,..",
          "I see this years before it is what it is today! Never thought a bunch of beer cans could go so far.. Take the tour I hear it's great!",
          "This is one of the cool and fun things that only Texas can get away with having. The thing that most fascinated me about this house was all the work and time it must have taken to cut up those beer cans and wire everything together. The pictures are exactly what you will see.",
          "Love this little house.. Fun to take people to and such a Houston Monument. Worth the drive by. Amazing to think one man did all this",
          "Be sure to find out how to book to get in, they had it rented to a private family and visitors can only see it from the sidewalk.",
          "It was a pretty cool house to take photos of and look around from the outside. Nothing much to do here except just look, say 'cool', and then go on your way to the next stop.",
          "This is definitely something on the off beat side, but I have to say it was interesting. If you are in the neighborhood check it out.",
          "I brought my parents here and they LOVED it! The now-deceased owner put 20 years into this creation. It is actually very artistic. Worth the $2 admission fee to see the inside of the house, which is an art deco blast from the past period piece, right down to the kitchen and",
          "This time we had my sister and husband and decided exploring a bit more of Houston. Chose the Heights and found this interesting \"museum\" of beer can all over the place. Worth seeing since you can tell you'll never see something like this again: a little house completely covered",
          "I've seen glass bottle houses that were more intricately designed. But it wasn't bad, either. If there were anything else in the area that drew my attention, I might be inclined to go out that way again. But it was just average. No real thrill for me. Kudos to the",
          "Very unique, truly one of a kind, a house covered in cans and those old poptop tabs. Good photo opts if you are in the area.",
          "The value is in the exterior of the house. Don't know that the admission fee is worth the $2 and definitely don't think guided tour would be worth it.",
          "My friend and I had a good time taking the kiddos! They loved looking at the whole house. I too found it fun and interesting. The neighborhood it is in is also very neat.",
          "The first time i went it was closed for renovations. Wemt back with a group of teachers and it was fun. Someone had too much time on their hands through the years to create this!",
          "Be sure to stop by - on your way to somewhere else. It ranks up there with the giant ball of twine and other silly gems out there. Just something that you've got to see for yourself.",
          "I have always lived in Houston, but never heard of the Beer Can House until recently. It's only $2 per person to walk around, or $5 per person for a guided tour. It's fairly close to the museum district, and it's worth the slight offshoot. You can walk around the yard and",
          "This is an interesting little gem in the heart of the city. Definitely worth seeing. It is unexpected.",
          "Luckily, our GPS got us right there but it is tucked away in a neighborhood. It was $5 each for the tour so for 3 of us we passed. Took pics from our car and drove on. Odd how it is set in a neighborhood as just another house. The neighbors must love all the traffic!",
          "This is truly unique and a fun place to see! Take your out-of-town visitors...there's nothing like it in the world!",
          "Admission is reasonable, a video gives you a peek into the mind of a man who would speed years putting aluminum siding on his home. In this case aluminum siding made mostly from beer cans. But there is more to see, his wind chimes his ladder of success and his answer to mowing",
          "This was something I would do, impromtu, with the kids. Not a real destination, but worth an hour visit on a nice day.",
          "This is just one of those places that if u can find it, you will never forget it. Worth the search",
          "It's one of my favorite small little places in Houston that's fun for a quick moment, be sure to look at the very old beer cans",
          "What can you say? Where else can you see a structure lovingly created of deconstructed, flattened, mangled, and otherwise useless byproducts of the American pastime? Once one gets over the silliness of it all, the beer can tab streamers tinkling in the breeze induce a strange",
          "I love this place. It just speaks Texas and Houston in particular. It is eclectic and beautiful. You have to see it to grasp it. The inside has been restored and is now open as a museum. Recommend.",
          "It was near where we were having brunch so we stopped by. Passed a good fifteen minutes and took a few good photographs. Didn't do the tour as there was no one around.",
          "You have to see this! I have brought several sets of out of town friends. Friends, that are well traveled, have seen many things. All of them have loved this place. Great story behind it too!!",
          "Very unique, good for a stop on the tour of Houston for visitors",
          "Arrived well in the middle of opening time on Saturday only to find a chained gate and nobody around. The sign asking for a $10 donation was just an insult based on that. Still, clearly this house was a labor of love for someone, and even just walking around the front of it",
          "Where would the world be without eccentric people who do crazy things with their cars/houses/clothes etc.? It'd be pretty boring. I love the beer can house and try to visit at least once a year.",
          "One person created something delightful from trash! It is someplace out-of-towners should see and never fails to bring smiles. It's an original.",
          "The Beer Can House is worth a visit if only to see how one person could devote their whole lives to a seemingly trivial pursuit. But it's not really trivial when you see it in person. It's pretty cool.",
          "A really cool and impressive site to see. A very unique attraction!",
          "Wierd and wacky-In a suburban setting with little or no good parking this house is unique if a little odd. This guy nust have liked beer!",
          "I enjoyed my visit and it was very interesting. I probably would not go back because I have seen it but I would recommend visiting it for something unusual.",
          "Have your camera ready. This is a fun and safe camera opportunity for you and your family.",
          "If you like local quirky places, this one fits the bill. Worth a drive-by, but plan for less than 10 minutes unless you're there when tours are offered.",
          "We only viewed the outside of the house, not because the minimal entrance fee but because we were short on time. We were mindful of staying on the sidewalk and not walking on the property to take photos. The house was not hard to find and is in what appears to be a nice",
          "We came midweek so were only able to do a drive by. For us it wasn't really worth seeking out. Although I am a huge supporter of recycling and appreciate bringing attention to it, I'm not sure you should go out of your way for the stop.",
          "Went to Houston on Memorial Day long weekend. The visit to the Beer Can House was surprisingly interesting. We didn't knew what to expect when we reached there but the house as you can guess with the name has been built with lots and lots of Beer Cans as well as bottles. Inside",
          "It is a sight to see (like my dad always said \"just so you can say you have seen it\") but I probably would'nt go see it again. It definitely took a lot of time to work on this but still trying to figure out if he was bored or crazy.",
          "Very unique and a true labor of love. More than just a creative expression but a love story of a long married couple with the age old problem of how to keep a man busy in retirement! The video story of the couple makes the house come alive. Certainly worth the modest entry fee.",
          "After recently moving to Houston, I visited the Beer Can House and LOVED it! It's a quaint house in the middle of a neighborhood that's completely covered in beer cans. During your visit you will see the story of one Houstonian who enjoyed drinking beer on his porch and",
          "I totally loved the story behind John and Mary. They were a unique couple and I enjoyed learning why they chose to what some would say \"ruin their house\". This attraction only takes 15 to 20 minutes of your time and costs $2. I went in thinking he was nuts for covering his house",
          "It was an interesting stop on our way out of Houston but note that there is someone outside who is waiting to tell you that if you just step on the property, it's a $2 charge per person. I quickly stepped onto the sidewalk and only took pictures from there. To me it wasn't",
          "My husband and I took our kids (ages 8 & 5) today to see the Beer Can House. When you hear about a house like this you think the person who constructed it \"must be crazy\". After leaving the house, I had such a respect for the high quality of craftsmanship, the imagination and"

          "This place is pretty cool.  The owner truly appreciated the finer things in life.  On a serious note, this place is in the middle of a residential area  with no street parking. It is not easy to get to but it is well worth the experience.   The cans helped with cooling the house in the Texas summer.",

          "Nice idea. However you would think the whole house is made of the beer cans. This would have been awesome. However, it is still on o.k. After all, 5 bucks would not break the bank.",

Always happy to donate,  so was definitely willing to pay.  Would be nice to know up-front, just in case others aren't as willing when they arrive. ",

It seems like a popular spot for unique photography with the family. Doesn\u2019t take a lot of time, and it\u2019s free, so drive past it while",

        "wiki": "The Houston Art Car Parade is an annual event in Houston, Texas, featuring a display of all types of rolling art.  The first and largest Art Car parade in the world, at any given parade spectators will see cars, bicycles, motorcycles, roller-skaters, and many other types of motorized and human-powered vehicles all decorated in various themes.  There are also classic cars, lowriders, and various other highly modified roadworthy vehicles.  The parade has been a Houston tradition since 1988, when 40 decorated vehicles were featured during the Houston International Festival.  The first art car parade took place on May 14, 1986, when 11 vehicles participated in a parade down Montrose Boulevard within the Neartown area.  In recent years, the parade has been held on Allen Parkway until the 2015 season prior to the re-routing of Allen Parkway where the westbound lanes have been converted into parking spaces; since 2016 the parade has been relocated to a section of Downtown Houston going up Smith Street with parade route going past Houston City Hall exiting westbound to Allen Parkway. The 2004 parade featured 250 entries observed by a live audience of over 100,000 people. There were over 260 entries in the 2006 parade.  The 2007 parade featured 282 entries. On November 28, 2009, Houston had an illuminated art car parade, dubbed Glowarama. Dan Aykroyd served as the Grand Marshal for the 2010 parade.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArt car\nArtCar Museum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Art Car Parade website\nThe Houston Art Car MuseumPhoto collections\n2011 Parade (679 photos)\n2005 Parade (120 photos)\n2004 Parade (55 photos)\nArt Car Museum",

          "We are frequent visitors of this museum where you can observe that strange art that you won\u2019t see in another venues. The place offers different exhibitions and frequently they bring new artists. Highly recommend!!",
          "It's free. They do accept donations. The musuem is very small and there are only 5 cars including one car at the entrance. The museum also showcases 2D art work from local artists. The folks working the front desk at the museum were very nice. I enjoyed the museum it's good to",

          "Took some friends from out of town and they LOVED this little gem. Yes, it\u2019s small - but interesting. It\u2019s free to get in but donations are welcome. The cars themselves are so creative and well done that it makes you want to see more - at the art car parade. There\u2019s a little",
          "This was an expected visit that ended up being one of my favorite things in Houston. It\u2019s a quaint little museum with curated collections from contemporary artists and a few art cars. The cars on exhibit were incredible and i was absorbed by the documentary playing in the back.",
          "The boys loved the cars they also had other types of art! It takes about 15 minutes to walk through and only like 2 parking spots VERY limited parking",
          "Our family enjoyed the Art Car Museum a lot. Parking was a bit of a hassle. We had to park 2 blocks south the museum. There is a couple spots in front of the museum. The staff was awesome and informative. Doesn't take more then an hour to check everything out.",
          "These guys spend tons of time designing and making these cars so unique. If you haven't gone yet, you are missing out, especially you are into art and what it takes to build.",
          "A great place to take anyone really, just make sure your little ones don\u2019t touch anything , because boy is it tempting. Located in my favorite part of Houston, between the heights and Washington, it\u2019s a small museum, but worth a visit. It\u2019s a place that\u2019s very unique to Houston,",
          "I've taken many out-of-town guests to visit this museum. It's unique and eccentric. Some pretty impressive art cars and it's so easy to get there. Everyone really enjoys it!",
          "We took out-of-town friend to visit the Art Car Museum and they were WOW'd! So were we! Creativity is rampant in Houston and this is the best of the best.",
          "Well cared for art museum. I found the art more interesting than some of the other art museums we went to today.",
          "A true community gem. Not only was it cool to see the art cars, a breathtaking display of 3-D art, but I liked the pairing of the themed art exhibit (in this case, \"animals\") and the selection of \"first 100 submissions\" allowing many under-represented artists of all ages and",
          "This is a free museum(donations accepted). Perfect stop for an hour or less. They change exhibits about once every 30 days and have a special art show occasionally. If you find yourself in the Heights area of Houston and looking for something to do. Check it out.",
          "Small museum with not a lot of parking but worth a visit, interesting sculptures and artwork but it wouldn't take you long to walk through and see everything.",
          "This museum contains a small number of art cars, some unusual art creations, and numerous fanciful paintings. Whether unusual is your thing or you are a traditionalist, it is worth a stop to visit an art installation by people thinking outside the box. The staff is",
          "It\u2019s not in Houston\u2019s Museum District. It\u2019s in the Heights. It\u2019s not in an exotic looking manor house with extensive grounds. It\u2019s wedged in between a convenience store and, well, the Heights. It does have decorated cars as its main theme. Indeed, this is the organization",
          "Worth seeing - we enjoyed it. The staff there very informative and friendly. Parking is an issue there, we had to park a bit away and walk, but worth it. Recommend taking this place in.",
          "This is a great place to experience the arts. Many of these cars are some very creative art projects. Fun place to go...",
          "Bring your kids or stop by alone, it will still be a nice visit. 6 or 7 art cars on display plus a great video about the owners and history of many other art cars. Nicest people/docents answer questions. Free admission, but donations are greatly appreciated. Stay for 30",
          "I'm embarrassed because of how this museum's politically motivated display will reflect Texans and Americans solutions to disagreements. Unfortunately, International travelers come to see beautiful American automobiles and instead leave with the collector's childish solutions",
          "Small museum of cars and some other artwork, doesn\u2019t take long to see the whole place. Friendly guy at the entrance and free to enter",
          "We spent about an hour in this museum. There is no charge but they do have a donation box. It was so interesting what some people could do to make a car into art. It's well worth the visit if you have the time. Parking is limited in the front of the museum.",
          "For sure worth a visit. The building itself is a piece of art already. A couple of very nicely done up cars. The 2006 winner of the art car parade is a real masterpiece, unbelievable how much time did they spent to put all these little pieces together.",
          "This free museum is a worthy stop when in the downtown area. There is a rotating group of cars on display, all uniquely and outlandishly decorated. The creativity and detail is truly special and you can get up close to see the cars, which gives you a much different experience",
          "We have always wanted to check out the Art Car Museum so we did so today. It is a small museum with a few art cars and videos about different people and the cars they have designed It was well worth the stop to see the detail On these amazing cars.",
          "I brought my mom to visit the Art Car Museum on her first visit to Houston. She had seen pictures online and seen pictures I had sent her from the annual Art Car Parade in April. She was thrilled with the cars they had on display (which routinely rotates). The museum is free,",

          "I visited the museum with a group of Urban Sketchers. The museum is quite small and so only 5 cars were on display. But those 5 were pretty special! Two art cars and three gorgeous classics, including a 110 year old Bianchi that survived 2 world wars in a Swiss barn. The",
          "This is for those into autos, art, and quirkiness. The museum has limited parking and is very small don\u2019t expect a large display of rare antiques in fact really about only five autos were on display. Parking is limited here so best bet is street parking. The interesting nature",
          "Take a look at what happens when ingenuity serves humor. The creativity alone will bring a smile to your face, and you might just come up with an idea for your own parade entry...",
          "Since I left, the incredible Art Car Parade now has a permanent home. Don't miss this Museum if you can't be there during the Parade. These are NOT really cars; they are fantastical, whimsical art pieces.",
          "Donations accepted, no entrance fee. Just a few cars and some artwork but everything is amazing. Very nice folks working there and you can definitely feel their love for the car art culture.",
          "Friends and I went to the museum on a Sunday afternoon when on site were: a fully restored Packard Super Eight, a fully restored pink Cadillac Seville and a one of a kind Bianchi limousine. In the back was a cool dragon head mobile. A great visit to the museum!",
          "This is a very small museum. However, it packs in a lot of personality and captures the quirky nature of the annual art car parade. I highly recommend taking the time to visit, particularly if you are not in town to see the parade.",
          "Love the art car museum. It rotates shows pretty often, and this time it was a rat rod exhibit. There was also a roller derby photo show on the walls. The building is well laid out and has lots of knowledgeable volunteers. Parking is a pain in the butt - very limited. While",
          "Interesting collection of odd, weird,and strange vehicles some totally ridiculous but kinda fun. Dreamlike ..their imaginations have become real ..kinda sorta..it\u2019s small with only a few cars ..there\u2019s a small museum like area with literature also a video viewing area",
          "This museum is small but worth visiting (30 minutes) if you are in the area. They will have one or two art cars on display and an art exhibition. I always bring out-of-town friends here and even for me there is usually something new because they rotate exhibits often. It's a",
          "One can see the far-out side of the creators of the art decorations on actual automobiles. Real talent in the design and result.",
          "Love the idea but they have a really limited selection of cars and not much on building them or anythign more. Fortumately it's cheap and not crowded so worth a visit just to say you've been there.",
          "Meh. Took several grandchildren, including teen-aged grandsons because we thought they'd like it. They were interested for about 5 minutes. Kinda not worth it to us, but everyone has their thing.",
          "Two cars parked outside that had been artfully modified and one more inside to look like a cockroach, then all the art was centred around Donald Trump and the first 100 hundred artists who come with a piece of art are allowed to exhibit. Really good.",
          "We love the art car parade. We thought this would be a neat place to go. Although interesting, I was expecting a lot of art cars there. There were only about 4 cars inside. Neat to look at but we were through with the self tour in about 15 to 20 minutes.",
          "Have always wanted to visit the Art Car Museum. Although parking is a bit tight, visited recently. If you are interested in current Washington politics, and not a Trump fan, the current art exhibit inside might be for you. However, it was a bit disappointing that there",
          "Its a small museum consisting of 3 rooms but it has plenty of very interesting art cars! The guides at the museum are very friendly and tell you about the history behind each car! They also recommend that you attend the Houston Art Car festival in April!",
          "I was hoping to see more ART CARS but really inside there are only like three and then other random exhibits. The place is rather small too. But luckily it was free and the staff is super nice.",
          "Utilizing children to do projects to express your own personal views is sickening. Contorting \"art projects\" to spread negativity is uncalled for when it involves children. Let them be kids until they are adults and can make up their own minds about adult issues.",
          "There's a few of the creative Art Cars in the museum, but one of the best parts are the variety of art exhibitions that change periodically. I have been there a few times and always see something new and interesting.",
          "This is one of the coolest spots in Houston! There is always a refreshing art exhibit to accent the outrageous and wonderfully adorned cars",
          "The Art Car Museum has some original and interesting art, but it's not a great place to bring kids. The art is too easy for kids to access, and the kiddos are just dying to touch it all. They have all kinds of interesting pieces, and the art is super eclectic, which makes it",
          "This museum is free. There are a few rooms with some local art displayed and a few art cars. There is a video that is very well done showing some artists explaining how they came to be art car enthusiasts. This is a great first stop before seeing all the art Houston has to offer.",
          "My wife and I went to the Art car museum and it was very neat! They had a few cars on display and a video of the art car parade. I never new how big car art was until I watched the video! The staff was very nice and very passionate about car art! Visit if you can! It is free but",
          "I have lived here in Houston for nearly 30 years but never went to the Art Car parade. It was a fun experience. Lots of creativity. Also a lot of people. The food truck were a great idea but having to wait in long line and then not able to get a drink with your food was a",
          "Really nice museum dedicated to the art car parade. There are usually 3 cars on display and exhibits rotate so it's always changing. Admission is free, donations accepted. Volunteers working at the museum are art car participants of the parade and can answer any question you",
          "Really great exhibition, pretty small but perfectly formed. The staff were very friendly and happy to impart their knowledge",
          "We had planned our whole 3 hour trip to come see this Museum, mostly because of the reviews & pictures of cars. One thing, none of the reviews addressed was that there were only 3 cars and the rest was art work. My son is a car enthusiast and we were looking for a day trip to",
          "You can now see many of the regulars of this classic houston event in this year round exhibit. You'll be amazed what people have done with old buckets of rust.",
          "Wanting to do something completely different while on vacation, our merry little band went to the Art Car Museum. The gallery has more than just cars but other art in various media. I would like to have seen more cars, but those that were there were most impressive. I LOVED the",
          "The imagination runs away with all different themes.Must see. May cars have sculpture like additions..For sure these cars are not street worthy.",
          "We stopped here after the Degas exhibit at the HMFA. This was a vastly different side of the art world, both of which should be enjoyed. This is more than art cars and is worthy of at least a one hour visit. The staff was very friendly. No admission charge.",
          "They had a VW bug sized animal made of spoons. Lots of inventive displays which change frequently. No admission charge but donations appreciated.",
          "Cute little museum tucked into a commercial neighborhood. There was more artwork than cars - a bit different than what I was expecting. The art was interesting, though. The best part of the museum was the documentary on art cars and the artists who make them. It was fascinating!",
          "I had family come in from out of town. The had never seen Art cars. They have 5 on exhibit. In addition, they have alot of video history and art car enthusiasts.",
          "This eccentric museum is a small, yet adorable museum tucked away in the Heights area of Houston contains rotating exhibits of various art cars. There is no entrance fee. The Houston Art Car parade takes place every April, so you'll be able to see most of the other art cars that",
          "This is a nice little museum five cars and many pieces of art on the walls. Video of the Art Car Parade. Can't beat the price, free.",
          "A small rotating collection of fantastic art cars draws me back to the Art Car Museum on a regular basis. But unexpected art exhibits that change out every 3 months with a variety of themes are what bring back the crowds. Each new show has a social opening with food and wine and",
          "We went there just for time pass, we were expecting more vintage cars there but instead get 2-3 cars with amazing art on it. 2 people run this and entry is free here, they just promote artists who live their dreams. They have these small documentaries of various cars they have",
          "Houston is home to the country's first Art Car Parade (which is hosted by the Orange Show) and home to one of the country's only art car museums. How do I know all this? Thanks to research I did while writing my children's book about an art car. The museum is a cool place to see",
          "My friend and I are local to Houston and were looking for something to do on a Saturday morning. I was naming various museums and this one came to mind. She was game and we were at the museum the minute it opened up. The museum is about the size of a medium size house, so it",
          "Seeing an Art Car in Houston is such a treat - I just wish the museum had more of them on display so you can really get an idea of how creative and crazy they can be!",
          "We throughly enjoyed this place. Don't expect a huge exhibition or to spend a long time inside. It's a small place with cars exhibited at a time as well as art pieces from local artists. The cars change, so I have heard it can be totally different the next time you go. It's",
          "A small but fun museum with changing exhibitions that include 2 and 3 dimensional artwork and, usually, an artcar. An art car is one that has been completely decorated with a theme or modified to resemble something else. We once saw a small car that had been turned into a",
          "Not to far out of town. Free. They have four cars on display. Wish they had a few more. Also had art exhibit which I liked. A movie shows some interviews with the car designers. OK",
          "What a nice little museum! Lots of interesting art car photos hanging in the gallery. And four amazing cars displayed for all to see. There's also a fabulous color book for sale, showcasing many of the almost 300 cars driven in the parade. There's no admission charge but",
          "Always changing display of cars and artist. Cars decorated with sea shells, sculptures and everything else. Free. Limited parking.",
          "Cool smaller museum. Total slice of life, unique original exhibits. I saw the art cars which are truely amazing. Also a show of black and white photographs of Houston and its residents. The staff is great!!! Very interesting, knowledgable and just darn sweet! Worth",
          "That someone could do that to a car/van /truck,Tiny gem. Fun thing to do. So glad I had a chance to go.Exhibits change often. They also sponsor an annual parade of Art cars in April.",
          "There are a few museums that make you smile from the moment you walk in. The folks who run this place want it to be fun and intimate. You'll enjoy a brief visit, with some really eccentric, unique vehicles, and be on your way in an hour or so, unless you just can't hep but",
          "We happened to arrive here on Art Car Parade Saturday, April 9th. We had called ahead and a message machine told us they would have the museum open after the annual parade had ended. So... about 3 p.m. we arrived to find four cars from the parade that had just arrived at the",
          "The exhibits here are very good ones and alternative offerings that many others wouldn't have the guts to show. There are always some great art cars on exhibit as well. For an afternoon visit that will make you smile and often also make you think, this is the place to go.",
          "I get art, cars and their intersection, but this is a very small museum. With 4 cars on display, leaves lots to the imagination. Sure the Art Car Parade would be fun to see. Free museum. Only 1/2 hour. Not a destination place, see if you are in the area.",
          "This is in our neighborhood and as the title says, it is quirky and a lot of fun. The exhibits change 3 or 4 times a year and they range from so-so to totally out there and wonderful! I have seen everything from a Cadillac with a 10 foot tail covered in seashells to a Vapirilla",
          "For a free museum, it was a decent place with some nice art pieces. But as a museum that makes you believe it has lots of cool, artsy cars, it does not. I think there were 3 cars when we went, so we were pretty disappointed.",
          "The art car museum is fun to drop in if you're in the neighborhood, but not worth making a special trip. It's free, which is a plus (honestly, I'd have been disappointed if I'd paid admission though!). The museum is small, not much to see. I live down the road and have only been",
          "The small museum only had 4-5 cars in it as the cars are all privately owned. It is much more fun to see the parade.",
          "We went here for our first time with friends from out of town. There wasn't much to see although I understand they change it up regularly. When we were there. It was a variety of \"art\" but not to our tastes. There were 3 cars on display with only 1 being an \"art car\".",
          "Always fun to pop in and see what they have on display. Usually there are a few art cars in the gallery. The art work is usually contemporary and can be great or just mediocre. Personally I like the cars and seeing what new unique one has been added.",
          "I have lived in Houston-my whole life and we have amazing culture here. The Art Car Museum has been on my bucket list for years and now I fill fulfilled! First greeted by the sweetest and very knowledgeable person at the front desk. Not only are there Art cars but art from local",
          "We popped in as walking by. A modern art gallery, my husband expected more cars, was disappointed as there was not a lot of car art. It supports local artists which is great. Only in there for 20 mins, quite a few people in there including families.",
          "Neat modern art and example Art Car parade winner/entries. Free but, please make a donation. Make sure you check hours of operation.",
          "Normally a word that describes that which is beyond description and that's perfect for this place . The art is modern, wild and part of Texas history",
          "If you are hoping to see loads of prettily painted cars, don't bother going. It's free but lacking in much content. Funky paintings cover the walls and three cars cover the floors of this tiny museum. The one car, the Ork car, may be worth the visit since it is free",
          "We enjoy the Art Car Parade every year, so we wanted to see the museum. On arrival, an elderly bearded staff member told us there is nothing to see these days, they are preparing their next exhibition. I said, it would be nice if your website told about that so that people do",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed this museum, which is a tribute to Houston artists. I've attended the Art Car Parade several times, but this FREE museum displays many details about each car in its rotating exhibits. I enjoyed seeing the hand drawings and photos of how the car was envisioned,",
          "It was our first visit and we thoroughly enjoyed it! It was free to get in and one of the art car mechanics was volunteering. Gary was very informative about the background of the artists and cars and was very enjoyable to visit with! Definitely worth a visit if your in Houston!",
          "If you are in the neighborhood its worth your time to stop in. When we went there was no charge to look around. It was small and it took us about 30-45 minutes to look around. But the longer you looked at the cars the more interesting things you saw.",
          "You've see them on TV, but you case 4 actual art car parade winners here. Also included are art pieces in this museum gallery. Be sure to check out the art car video in the back. Then drive down to Victoria and see their museum too.",
          "This unique collection of art is definitely worth the stop. They rotate out their collection fairly regularly. Very clean and the people inside were very nice and knowledgeable. It's really more of an art gallery than a museum. The place is run donations so be sure to help",
          "This place was very neat. It was more like a gallery than a museum. It was,like everyone else said, much smaller than I expected. I was very excited to go here and spend a significant amount of time looking at cars and how were they changed to be art. There was one car outside",
          "If you are going to be in Houston, this is a worthwhile stop (as is the Beer Can House and Orange Show.) Most people don't know that Houston is home to some really quirky art. Part of the quirky art scene is the annual Art Car Parade--which is the largest in the world! This",
          "Cool me little place! it's free, which makes it the best part. Will definitely be going back. People are nice friendly helpful courteous and there are different exhibit throughout the year.",

          "it is a very small place , a very small collection , not many cab's are aware of the location. it will take you 15 USD to 25 USD to reach from the downtown , access is free .. there are some nice give away free post card on the reception .. the lady on the reception seems to be",
          "We got into town the day after the art car parade. My husband thought the people driving around with buttons glued all over their cars were just crazy, but don't worry - I explained! Next best thing - the Art Car Museum. We saw about six cars at the museum and they were all",
          "I had never heard of the Art Car Museum, let alone the annual Houston Art Car Parade, but I am a fan of those things that exist just for the heck of it. Does the world need art cars? I can think of no rational response, which must mean that art cars are essential.",
          "Interesting little museum with a few Cars and other art hanging throughout the building. The cars were definitely unique and I enjoyed it. Staff was very friendly.",
          "Based on the website's photo gallery we expected to see a fair number of cars on display. There were only 3 or 4. Disappointing. Not worth the drive.",
          "Small museum but well worth the free visit. Novel one of a kind exhibit of a few cars to marvel at. The video you enjoy while seated shows a marvelous array of design, exhibition and artistry in the workmanship of these art cars. A don't miss exhibit!",
          "Since we watched the art car parade last year, we thought we should give this museum a go. We are glad we did. They switch out the cars every 3 months and they have a new artist in display too with lots of artwork. Make sure you take tins to watch the video in the back of the",
          "The guys that we were with like cars so we stopped to see what this was all about. There were only four vehicles there but they were very interesting to look at. There were videos running which are also interesting to watch. We found a spot to park in front of the building",
          "A group of us stopped here after another venue. There were five amazing vehicles, all amazingly creative. There was a show of paintings by an artist. I understand the cars and the art changes on a regular basis. Would have liked to see more cars. They had an interesting short",
          "This is a very enlightening way to spend 30-45 minutes. Yes there are only 3 or 4 art cars present at one time, but they are beyond anything you can imagine from just pictures or video or watching a parade.Walk around them and take pictures. Also the mini-video theater has some",
          "After going to the Art Car Parade in Houston, we decided to make a trek to the Art Car Museum. I expected 15-20 cars. There were 4. Granted, there were great videos playing showing other cars and the inspiration that got them started, but the few cars on display was a let",
          "Call first to make sure they're open. Small and unique. And come to the Art Car Parade, too! A true Houston experience!",
          "This is a must see in Houston. Always free. There are cool cars and displays to see. The only thing I do not care for is that some of the displays are quite political. Either way it is always a fun place to go.",
          "It's small but worth it- The exhibits change every 2-3 months or so- Go and sit and view the video first-- it's explains a lot. Plus there is a little room where lots of postcard and flyers tell about upcoming art events David Best did the outside and he is very involved in",
          "Houston is the self-proclaimed Art Car Capital of the World so it is only fitting that we try to check out the Art Car Museum located in the Heights. Entry is free (which is always nice when visiting museums because you never know how long you are actually going to want to",
          "Our seniors group had heard so much about this museum that we gave it a visit. And were not impressed. Parking is a problem. No place to park a bus, if you get there at 5 minutes to 11AM just keep driving since they will not open the gates for you so you can get the bus off of",
          "The cars and art is like nothing you have ever seen. So much for your eyes to feast one with every car! And it's free! We enjoyed the videos of previous art car parades and we are considering flying in for the parade! Nice and kind folks who work there and informative about",
          "Easily a 5 star adventure if parking was easier to locate and find. Every 3 months we were told the cars and exhibits of art and photography change. We were there when they displayed a wonderful exhibit of Ken Hoge photography - Austin Music Scene of the Late 1970s to Early",
          "The cars are amazing, but the best fun are the videos describing various cars and owners around the country. It gives you a look into the art world and psychology that you don't often get to explore.",
          "This small museum can be completed in half an hour. They have a few cars from past art car parades, videos showing the artists, their cars and the reasoning behind their art. Travelling photos. This time the photos were from Cuba (2013) and ones taken by homeless people.",
          "I thought the space was great but under used. There were only 3 cars in the place . The photo exhibit of the homeless by the homeless was interesting - they seem to be occupied by the transportation especially the light rail.",
          "recommended by family as an interesting place to visit whilst we were in Houston and we were not disappointed. Lots going on here. The gun & car art display was intriguing and offered so many takes on the gun art theme. Quite where some of the artists were coming from I am not",
          "good little gallery- I saw the \"Gun show\" which was open to interpretation. Was a very accessible and comfortable gallery - no snootiness at all. I thought there would be more cars as they only had 1-2 on display. They rotate them out apparently. Staff was very friendly",
          "Although it had some interesting pieces, it wasn't really worth going out of our way to find this place. They had advertised a gun exhibit when we went. We expected to see actual guns and cars. As other reviewers have stated, there were only 3 cars. And there was a gallery of",
          "We went to this museum thinking we would see car art - meaning art on cars or cars that were the art. There were few of either and more art with a gun theme.",
          "The Art Car Museum is definitely a must-see in Houston. It's incredibly unique, and depending on the day, has even more unique visitors just hanging around to see what the latest pieces are. It is free, but accepts donations. There are also so \"iffy\" art pieces, that are",
          "Tiny museum stuck in between buildings. You'll miss it if you aren't ISO. Only 3 cars on display. Wish there were more. The video on the art cars of Houston is worth the stop.",
          "During a recent business trip to Houston, I had a couple of hours before my flight left, so I drove over to the Art Car Museum. It does not take very much time to see everything, but it is well worth the visit. And the admission is free! All of the cars are drivable, and must be",
          "More photos than cars, try to catch the parade, but still interesting and definitely worth a look if you have a chance.",
          "I guess my expectations were too high. There were only 3 cars on display. Most of the artwork isn't something that kids / tweens would enjoy. I really didn't either to be honest. It took us 15 min to see everything..there are 2 informative videos to watch. Very limited",
          "It is a small charming unique place.... The art work displayed is very unique and worth a stop! In order for you to really admire it, dont take the little ones! We took quite a few pictures! Go!",
          "Parking wasn't so great, but it's free! Besides cars, they also have different art exhibits which although unexpected were quite intriguing. Also were informed that they change the exhibits out frequently so it's always a new experience!",
          "This is a great little museum. It is a fun, free activity for all ages. I really enjoyed the Pat Johnson and Carter Ernst Collections as well as the Art Cars.",
          "A fun and interesting stop when in Houston. As some have mentioned, it is somewhat limited with only 3 cars, but the rest of the art was neat. Ask questions and you will get answers. The staff was very happy to pass along the stories behind the cars. Check ahead of time as",
          "Good for the whole fam. You could be in and out in 10 minutes or spend a while visiting. Even has free parking! I put some money in the jar because it was worth it. See attached pic---these aren't regular cars.",
          "I enjoy the art car movement and expected a larger museum. The museum has 3 cars and a variety of art. I would love to see more cars. If you do not about the art car movement go, it will be fun and educational. If you are into art cars, you will be disappointed.",
          "This is a fun and inventive place to see the artist that display their mobile works of art! I would recommend it if you have time!",
          "Nice place to visit and see all the cars that the people put alot of effort into decorating with their art!",
          "The art car museum is one of those funky, quirky places to visit in the Heights area of Houston. It is free which is really nice. I took my husband and children here (ages 7 and 5) to show them 1) that a museum does not have to be the usual museum of natural science sort of",
          "FUN place to wander in and see the creativity that Houstonians have with regard to the art Cars. Worth a trip if you like the 'different'. Small and yet full of great cars.",
          "Not to little or too much to see. This place is a fun place to visit for a half hour. The owner was there when my wife and I visited and he had lots of interesting stories about the history of the museum and the parade. Cars rotate thru the museum to keep the museum fresh.",
          "i've been in Houston 3weeks so far and this was the coolest thing i've seen. The museum is free, friendly, fascinating, and the temporary exhibit, titled, \"God\" was really awesome. Everything from inspirational traditional Christian ideas to wonderfully zany free thinking ideas",
          "Always inspiring! Not easy to find so map quest it. Park right in front. Funky and friendly - love it!",
          "Some great exhibits at the art car museum. Depending on the exhibits you might see cars transformed into fire breathing dragon creatures or commentary on the use of force bu the government. No discarded metal was spared in the making of the art car museum. There is a small",
          "If you are in the area, this is a fun little stop, but there really isn't much to it. Only about 6 or 7 cars and maybe some exhibits of local artists. See the Art Car Parade instead, if you can.",
          "This is a must see. The creativity is amazing. IT will definitely motivate you to catch the Art Car Parade. It may even motivate you to art your car.",
          "Yes, a museum about Art Cars. If you haven't seen an art car, you need to get out there and find one! if you can't go to the art car parade (Maybe next year!!) this is the next best thing. This was THE reason for our detour through Houston and was well worth it.",
          "Not huge, but a great place to appreciate creative and strange minds! Good for 5 and up. It's hot in the summer, so go in spring or fall if you can.",
          "This is a great stop on the way to something more exciting. The displays change every 3 months. worth seeing.",
          "It's not often you will find a free attraction but this one is and is worth a visit if you are close by. They really do have some very special and interesting cars as well as a little art car info and history.",
          "Went to hickory hollow on a Sunday afternoon, and stopped by the Art Car Museum. It was not our \"destination\" , but a good impromtu visit with the kids. Fun hour spent.",
          "It must be the heat. People sitting with their tongues hanging out thinking of something, anything, to put it out of their minds. At least that's my theory. One thing is for sure, though, the Art Car craze that began in the late 20th century has come to full fruition and this is",
          "A great place for a family outing. This is a houston treasure to see. It is a lot of fun and different from your normal museums",
          "I'm glad to have gone for the sake of having experienced something Houston is known for, but the museum is quite small and really only had four art cars as long as several small rooms (too small for cars) predominantly occupied by contemporary wall art (aka paintings, but also",

          "In the first part of the year The Art Car museum has an open call for the first 125 artists to respond to exhibit their art--It's a merry bit of diversity in ART! Plus there is always a few Art cars--This time it was the Phantom and Cigswillkillya- Great place to take the",
          "This small museum is earnest and wacky. It houses some fascinating cars and various temporary car-related exhibits in a small space. (On my first visit, tire treads re-appropriated into wall hangings.) It's a nice contrast to the grand, lofty museums like MFA and HMNS. Fun!",
          "The Art Car Museum is definitely worth a look. There aren't as many cars as I would like in their small space but the walls are covered in interesting art and the cars rotate from time to time so there is always something to see. The admission is free. The staff are eager and",
          "It seems more like an empty space. I can count the number of strange automobiles they had on display, about 5 and lots of paints. Dont know what Art Car is intended to appeal to.",
          "Only a few of the actual art cars on display with a large art exhibit of local artists, which was interesting. Would have liked to see a movie of one of the actual art car parades, since we won't be here for the parade. Kind of a disappointment.",
          "Overall impression: While it is quirky, it is a very approachable art gallery for someone who does not have the patience for a three floor art museum. The art is varied and I enjoyed it. Worth a visit even if you are not that into art. Description: The building is instantly",
          "I've been waiting a long time to go to the Art Car Museum since I've see pictures of the annual Art Car Parade. I heard there were cars here. The descriptions already provided are very accurate. This free museum is small and will take you about 30 minutes or less to go through.",
          "Artists let loose on car design. Brilliant. Small displays but they do change. Free to enter, enthusiastic staff and you CAN take photos-unlike the more stuffy \"art\" museums. Local paintings and sculptures too. Free parking in the neighbouring shop car park.",
          "Not a large place but the cars are great fun. I think children would also enjoy. If you can see the parade it is very good but the museum is a nice place to visit for something out of the ordinary.",
          "This little place has turned out to be been one of the best museums I have ever been to! Its utterly inspiring, with the friendliest staff and pieces of art that will knock your socks off. I will never look at cutlery in the same way again now I have seen it transformed into a",
          "Having viewed the Art Car Parade for several years it made sense to take an out of towner to their museum in the Heights. Indeed, it was on his list of things to see. Sadly, the museum is but a glimmer of the parade. A total of 4 cars were on display, verses the 300 or so that",
          "You won't find many places like this. The whole tour takes only about 40 minutes if you are stalling. There are just a few crazy cars to check out but they are like nothing I've seen before. There are some neat things such as one of the cars made of spoons and cars that look",
          "The museum stands out as an appropriate and interesting looking building for the Art Cars. Don't expect to find too many art cars here, there are just a few. The reason is that the majority of art cars are privately owned and most owners drive them around Houston on a daily",
          "I took my five kids (ages 7-17) here during our museum trip to Houston. Judging from the museum website, I expected the venue to be small and inconspicuous, but when we came to it on the street, it definitely stood out! Parking was very limited (only a small driveway), so we",

The staff is fantastic, energetic and loves to answer any question.  Seriously, this and the Menil are probably the two best museums in the city.  No offense MFA.",

A good place to take teens, but not kids (there was one sculpture that some parents may not feel is appropriate for their kids, but it was just one). Learned a lot about the history of art cars and each piece of art makes you think.",
          "We went to Boston and wasn't sure of what to do with all our time during the day. Came across this cute little museum and was amazing. Exhibits were very interesting and you can just see the detail which goes into it. I'd recommend if \u2026",

          "Super cool museum. They give you a little speech when you walk through the door. They put out a call to local artists with a theme. They then chose the art cars which match the art the best. The employees are very knowledgeable about the \u2026",

        "wiki": "Buffalo Bayou is a slow-moving river which flows through Houston in Harris County, Texas. Formed 18,000 years ago, it has its source in the prairie surrounding Katy, Fort Bend County, and flows approximately 53 miles (85 km) east through the Houston Ship Channel into Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition to drainage water impounded and released by the Addicks and Barker reservoirs, the bayou is fed by natural springs, surface runoff, and several significant tributary bayous, including White Oak Bayou, Greens Bayou, and Brays Bayou. Additionally, Buffalo Bayou is considered a tidal river downstream of a point 440 yards (400 m) west of the Shepherd Drive bridge in west-central Houston.As the principal river of Greater Houston, the Buffalo Bayou watershed is heavily urbanized. Its 102-square-mile (260 km2) direct drainage area contains a population of over 440,000. Including tributaries, the bayou has a watershed area of approximately 500 square miles (1,300 km2).\n\n\n== Route ==\n\nThe upper watershed of Buffalo Bayou is impounded by the Addicks and Barker reservoirs, which comprise a major flood control system for the region. The reservoir system plays a crucial role in delaying and attenuating the peak outflow of the river during large rainfall events. Moving eastward, the Buffalo flows under State Highway 6 and into Terry Hershey Park, a linear park which follows the bayou for approximately 6 miles (9.7 km), culminating at Beltway 8.\nThe bayou meanders around the Memorial Villages between Beltway 8 and Loop 610. The banks along this reach are mostly private property, however there is a public access point and official Texas Parks and Wildlife paddling trail canoe launch at Briarbend Park, which is located in a quiet neighborhood south of San Felipe and west of Voss Road. There is another official canoe launch and access point just outside of 610 on Woodway. Additionally, it is legal to access the bayou at all public roadway bridges, but legal parking spots may not exist near these bridges.\nOn the east side of Loop 610, Buffalo Bayou passes along the south side of Memorial Park and the north side of River Oaks Country Club, and is accessible to the public along the entire Memorial Park frontage. Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens, the former estate of Houston philanthropist Ima Hogg, is located on the north bank of the bayou just east of Memorial Park. After passing under Shepherd Drive, the waterway enters Buffalo Bayou Park, which is bordered on the north by Memorial Drive and the south by Allen Parkway. The park continues for 2.3 miles (3.7 km) to Interstate 45, where it enters Downtown Houston. The bayou flows past Allen's Landing and joins White Oak Bayou before exiting the central business district at Interstate 69. The bayou widens considerably as it travels through the East End, culminating at the Houston Ship Channel.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early settlement ===\nAlong with Galveston Island and Galveston Bay itself, Buffalo Bayou was one of the focal points for early Anglo-American settlement in early Texas, first part of the Spanish Empire and then part of Mexico. Early communities began to appear at the beginning of the 19th century, including Lynchburg, Harrisburg, and Rightor's Point (modern Morgan's Point) in the 1820s. The bayou became important in Texas history when the final battle for Texas Independence was fought along its banks where it merges with the San Jacinto River.In the 1830s, new communities such as Houston were established along the shoreline. A local entrepreneur named Samuel Allen (unrelated to the founders of Houston) established a large ranch, later known as the Allen Ranch, between Harrisburg and Galveston Bay. Docks at Harrisburg, Houston, and the Allen Ranch gradually became the foundations of what would become the modern Port of Houston. Harrisburg served as the region's major trade center until the 1870s, when a large fire destroyed its railroad facilities, which were subsequently rebuilt in Houston.Houston's original docks, today known as Allen's Landing, were established at the foot of Main Street at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou. The first wharves were opened in 1840, and the Port of Houston was established in 1841. This was the most westerly location a small trading schooner could turn around; without extensive dredging, only small vessels could access the city. This site is now a public park adjacent to the University of Houston\u2013Downtown.\nAfter the Civil War, which bolstered the local economy, dredging became a more viable option. The Bayou Ship Channel Company began major dredging operations in 1870, and the city began receiving federal aid to complete the project. This first dredging of the Buffalo Bayou was completed in 1876.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, the Port of Houston had established itself as the leading port in Texas, eclipsing the natural harbors at Galveston and Texas City. The Turning Basin terminal in Harrisburg (now part of Houston) became the port's largest shipping point. The Texas oil boom of the early 20th century spurred further industrial development.\nExtreme floods in the first half of the 20th century, especially in 1929 and 1935, devastated Downtown Houston and resulted in a number of federally-funded flood control projects in the upper reaches of the watershed. The Texas Legislature created the Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) in 1937, and by the end of the 1930s, over $35 million ($643 million in 2016 dollars) of federal, state, and county funds had been earmarked for an extensive drainage program. In then-rural western Harris County, the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed Barker Reservoir, completed in 1945, and Addicks Reservoir, completed in 1948. Combined, these reservoirs provide 410,000 acre-feet of runoff storage, which has largely prevented downstream flood events. Six miles of Buffalo Bayou between present-day Highway 6 and Beltway 8 was channelized during the construction of the reservoirs. Later, between 1953 and 1958, the stretch between Shepherd Drive and Sabine Street west of Downtown was also straightened. The length of bayou between these two channelized sections, which largely runs through the Memorial Villages, has remained in its natural, meandering state.\n\n\n=== Modern history and revitalization ===\nIn the 1960s, local resident and conservationist Terry Hershey, working with local congressman (and eventual President) George H.W. Bush, prevented the federal government from lining the straightened sections of the bayou with concrete. In 1966, Hershey and a number of other homeowners in the Memorial area formed the Buffalo Bayou Preservation Association, which later expanded its mission and became the Bayou Preservation Association. In 1989, Terry Hershey Park, which runs parallel to the bayou between Beltway 8 and Highway 6, was dedicated to her efforts. The bayou is one of the only bayous in Houston to retain its natural riparian ecosystem.\nFollowing the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, Houston sought to address the untreated sewage that was being discharged into the bayous. The city has invested over $3 billion into new sewers, pumping stations, and sewage treatment plants across the metropolitan area, which has significantly improved water quality in the region.In 1977, Barbours Cut Terminal was opened at Morgan's Point, shifting shipping traffic away from the Turning Basin.\n\nIn 1986, the Buffalo Bayou Partnership, a nonprofit organization, was founded to leverage public and private financing towards renovating and expanding park space along the river. The Partnership's 2002 Buffalo Bayou Master Plan established a 20-year, $5.6 billion vision for the bayou centered on a series of linear parks through central Houston. The project goals include the rehabilitation of formerly industrial land, habitat restoration, canoeing and kayaking facilities, hike-and-bike trails, cultural programming, flood control management, and mixed-use urban development.\nThe Partnership has leveraged over $150 million to implement these projects. The Buffalo Bayou Promenade, opened in 2006, is a 23-acre (9.3-hectare) recreation area with 1.4 miles (2.3 km) of hiking and biking trails extending from Sabine Street west of Downtown to Bagby Street in the Theater District. In 2015, the Partnership completed Buffalo Bayou Park immediately to the west of the Promenade, adding another 160 acres (65 hectares) of renovated parkland along a 2.3-mile (3.7 km) stretch. Buffalo Bayou Park, labeled a \"signature, verdant downtown gateway\" by the Houston Chronicle, includes a dog park, broad lawns, gardens, restaurants, and an art space inside a historic disused cistern. In 2006 the Houston Cistern, managed by the Buffalo Bayou Partnership, started offering historical tours and immersive art exhibits.In August 2017, extensive rainfall from Hurricane Harvey brought the bayou to record high levels, shattering previous flood crests by several feet. Addicks and Barker reservoirs were filled to capacity, forcing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to initiate controlled releases of 16,000 cubic feet per second (450 m3/s) to prevent catastrophic uncontrolled releases and protect the structural integrity of the dams. Despite these efforts, uncontrolled releases did occur around the spillway at the northern end of Addicks Reservoir for the first time in the structure's history.The reservoir releases caused extensive flooding of neighborhoods and roadways along the western stretch of Buffalo Bayou between Barker Reservoir and Downtown; the Memorial area was heavily damaged. The bayou was projected to remain at a major flood stage for up to two weeks after the storm in order to drain the reservoirs as much as possible.\n\n\n== Role of the watershed ==\n\n\n=== Flood control ===\nThe Buffalo Bayou watershed is central to the drainage of Houston and Harris County. Lying over relatively impervious soils and very flat topography, the bayou has extensive natural floodplains, as do most Gulf coastal rivers and streams. Urbanization of the watershed has placed thousands of people in vulnerable areas and has affected the frequency and intensity of flood events.In response to the disastrous flood of 1935, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in association with the Harris County Flood Control District, began an extensive program of reservoir construction, removal of stream-bank vegetation, and channelization to reduce Houston's flooding risk. The two most prominent flood control features in the Buffalo Bayou watershed are the Addicks and Barker reservoirs in western Harris County, which provide a combined 26,000 acres (11,000 hectares) of open land for runoff storage. In recent years, extensive suburban development upstream of the reservoirs has stressed this flood control infrastructure.Since 2015, Buffalo Bayou has experienced three major flooding events, including Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the Tax Day floods of 2016 and a flood on May 26, 2015.\n\n\n=== Recreation and wildlife ===\nBuffalo Bayou is home to numerous urban parks, including George Bush Park (located entirely within Barker Reservoir), Terry Hershey Park, Memorial Park, Buffalo Bayou Park, and Marron Park in the East End. San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site, the site of the Battle of San Jacinto which ended the Texas Revolution, includes the USS Texas, a museum ship permanently moored near the mouth of the bayou.\nThe bayou supports a significant population of catfish, sunfish, gars, and bass for recreational fishing. It includes a population of birds and hosts the popular Waugh Bat Bridge. Alligators have also been spotted along the bayou.\n\n\n==== Navigation ====\nBuffalo Bayou is legally navigable by paddle craft from its source in Katy to the western end of the Ship Channel upstream of Wayside Drive. A majority of paddle trips generally take place between Highway 6 and Shepherd Drive section, with main focus on the section from Briarbend Park to Woodway and to Downtown Houston, generally because of ease of access and length of the trail.The section from Highway 6 to Beltway 8 is known for downed trees, which require frequent portages. The section from Beltway 8 to Briarbend Park is generally kept clear of blockages by the Harris County Flood Control District; however, there are several gravel bar hazards to negotiate during normal water flows. The section from Briarbend Park to Woodway is similarly kept clear, although there may be trees across the waterway immediately after storms.\n\n\n=== Water quality ===\nAs an urban waterway, Buffalo Bayou is especially vulnerable to low water quality. The condition of the bayou's waters has long been a topic of concern in Houston. During the 19th century, the river essentially functioned as both an open sanitary sewer and a source of drinking water. Industrial and agricultural discharge into the water was a common practice, and the bayou took on a reputation as a \"cesspool\" with an \"unbearable stench.\" It was not until the early 20th century that the city had the resources to construct sewerage and sewage treatment plants. However, environmental progress was slow, and Buffalo Bayou was still heavily polluted through the late 1940s.Today, the bayou still faces significant environmental challenges, including elevated levels of indicator bacteria, low oxygen saturation, and heavy nutrient pollution.In February 2019, it was reported that 64,000 gallons of jet fuel leaked into the bayou via the nearby Hobby Airport.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHouston Ship Channel\nPort of Houston\nSan Jacinto River\nList of rivers of Texas\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBuffalo Bayou from the Handbook of Texas Online\nBuffalo Bayou Watershed (Harris County Flood Control)\nUS Army Corps of Engineers Public Notice on the Memorial Park Demonstration Project\nThe University of Houston Digital Library has a collection of historical photographs about Houston, nearby communities, and more.

          "Visitors are taken on guided tours of the cistern. All tours are FREE on Thursdays. Quite a bargain! It's a cool reprieve from the Houston sun.",
          "The Houston cistern is very interesting and the tour is well done. It only lasts about 1/2 hour but has a lot of information and fun facts. We did it on a very warm and rainy day and it was perfect!",
          "This is a guided (only) tour of a 15,000,000 gallon indoor reservoir that used to be the backup water supply for Houston. Reservations are highly recommended, especially on free Thursdays. The wonderful echo is fun. The tour guides really know their stuff.",
          "This is a very interesting underground attraction which originally was the Houston water source more than 100 years ago and recently re-discovered. There is a $5, 20 minute tour, but the guide was only so-so as her voice did not carry. There is limited lighting for good",
          "We had a great tour of this site. Heard a lot about Houston history. The site itself is extremely impressive and many do not know of it's existence. Recommend visitting....if you are in the area.",
          "Interesting history of the first underwater drinking water of the city of Houston. It is approximately 30 minutes but those 30 minutes are filled with interesting facts.",
          "If you want to stop by, go for it! It\u2019s cool and the light show is fun. However, it\u2019s not something that I would do again.",
          "Great way to spend half an hour. The guides are well educated about Houston history. They give plenty of background into the development of the cistern and how it came about. Worth the $20.",
          "A tour of a disused water storage facility may seem an odd thing to do on a Sunday morning, but it was fascinating. Justin the guide spins a lovely yarn about the facility which used to have up to two million gallons of water in it, enough to supply the city\u2019s needs, at least",
          "Buffalo Bayou has greatly improved in recent years. On a nice day the walking trails are safe and scenic. We strolled down to the Houston Police Officers' Memorial and back to the Cistern check in, then sat on the balcony with a cold drink enjoying the views of downtown and",
          "We spent an afternoon at Buffalo Bayou Park and visited the Cruz-Diez art installation in the Cisterns. It was very relaxing and absorbing. The Cisterns are open ongoing but the art exhibit ends in April 2019. I'd recommending booking tickets ahead and it is not suitable for",
          "with the TripAdvisor reviews I read I did not realize it was required to get a tour at $5/each and on the hour (and so just missed the tour and somehow would need to wait 1.5 hours and had not planned for that (would have find to pay $5 and go in without a tour. Free parking on",
          "This is a unique place rescued from being destroyed by the power of progress. They have been able to keep it and make it as nice as it can be for an abandoned cistern. The experience they created by the Cruz-Diez lights make it even more interesting. I would highly recommend to",
          "We visited in January on one of those cool Texas weekends that mimic spring. We had taken some bikes around the Buffalo Bayou Park and came to the cistern. If you dont know where it is, its basically at the end of the BBP near the skate park. There is a bike rental place with",
          "This was a great historical view into the past water supply of Houston. The light show was down from the recent storm but can't believe it would let you down. Will be back soon to see since this artist leaves it's exhibit on Feb 3.",
          "Short but interesting tour. Enjoyed the history of the cistern and hearing the echoes of our voices. If you are in the area, I recommend it. Probably not exciting enough to make trip to Houston but definitely worth $5 entrance. Tickets must be purchased in advance online.",
          "I found this to be a really interesting space, nice to be able to access through a tour. I wouldn't build it up to be more than it is - it's an enormous damp chamber with interesting echoes and sight lines. Our tour guide had lots of stories to share. We had to wait a while for",
          "Take the time to visit \"Spatial Chromointerference\" at the Buffalo Bayou Park Cistern. Such a visually impactful display of color and movement imagined by Franco-Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez. Pictures and words cannot capture how beautiful this masterpiece is and how",
          "Sure, it\u2019s an old water storage facility. However, how many times do you get to take a look at one? The tour lasted 20 minutes and is very inexpensive. It\u2019s a great addition to Buffalo Bayou Park just west of downtown Houston. You can spend time before or after walking through",
          "This is nothing more than an old concrete water storage tank. I would not waste my time coming to walk around in a damp concrete vault. they attempt to present this as some hidden undiscovered piece of history but it was simply an old water storage tank that was taken out of",
          "My daughter & husband visited the Cistern & park on Mother's Day and it was a surprise and a treat. Cool, dark with an exciting & beautiful light installation within the walls. This fascinating walk through the Cistern didn't take long, wasn't expensive and was a lovely escape",
          "For first time visitors, I highly recommend that you sign up for the history tour (no light show) and the self-guided tour (with lights). Both are about 30 minutes or less. You walk 360 degrees around and above the cistern. The history of the cistern is very informative. This",
          "Mom in law and I visited the cistern this weekend and really enjoyed both the history tour and the art exhibit! We really didn\u2019t know what to expect and I was concerned with the amount of walking because mom in law can\u2019t walk long distances. But it was just 1/4 mile around the",
          "Have been wanting to see the water cistern on previous visits to Houston. After reading about this art (light) installation, decided to see it. I did not have time to take the historical tour, but our family enjoyed this art installation. Very unusual thing to do in Houston",
          "Went to see the newest art in the cistern. The light show is very good and love the way the lights play on the walls.",
          "A friend recommended we visit the cistern. So glad we did. Let me begin by thanking the attendant at the visitor checkin who allowed us entry without a reservation. FYI: Reservations are required even on Free Thursdays. Admission is $10 or $8 discounted rate. Free",
          "So you get to tour an underground water storage unit. I mean a better use of this place would have been to relocate the skate park here since in the middle of the day nobody was using it due to the heat. Essentially you got to walk around a big square and observe colored lights",
          "We were here for the kaleidoscope of lights (that\u2019s what I call it)exhibit. If you tend to have motion sickness, you may not want to do this. But if you can stomach it, go in. You do need to book ahead of time. The tours are every 30 minutes. I\u2019ve attached pictures to give you",
          "I had heard about the Cistern but had never visited. Sometimes it's great to be a tourist in your own city. We were fortunate to visit during a special art exhibit of Carlos Cruz-Diez at the Cistern: Spatial Chromointerference. It was a light show that played off the Cistern",
          "The Buffalo Bayou Cistern really should be ranked as a top must-see in Houston. First, it is for the entire family as it is an easy walk and only $5.00 for the 30-minute tour. But most of all it offers historical structure significance as an example of how to turn an old water",
          "I went with a coworker to the cistern which is an old underground water reservoir. The tour is $5 and is recommended to be booked in advance. I really enjoyed the tour, the tour guide was informative and friendly, and there are some really cool features which I will not share",
          "The \u201cCistern,\u201d as it has been dubbed, was the City of Houston\u2019s first underground drinking-water reservoir. Built in 1927, it provided decades of service until it was drained when it sprang a leak that couldn\u2019t be located or contained. This huge concrete structure is hidden",
          "This place was an unexpected gem!! So fascinating...acoustics amazing!! Great photo opps. Great for family or singles",
          "We visited the cistern over the holiday break. My kids had been out of school way too long and were board to death, so I started searching for interesting things to do in Houston. The cistern sounded interesting and somewhat educational so I thought we would give it a try and",
          "This is a unique place! Come visit by your self, with friends, family, teenagers, small kids, grandparents...... they all are going to love it! It\u2019s one of those places you have to see with your own eyes! Inexpensive/fun thing to do! This is a cisterna so once you\u2019re inside is",
          "Only had a brief time in Houston and wanted to explore the Bayou. Came across the cistern online on their website. Pitched up at 10.30 expecting an 11.00 tour and the delightful Austin gave us a personal tour. Very informative and hugely interesting. Delightful staff in the",
          "The reviews of the Cistern at Buffalo Bayou Park are accurate - the Cistern is a small gem. For the price, ease of visit, friendliness of the staff, intriguing light and sound effects (a really neat 17 second echo that tour groups can create and a set of stunning reflections),",
          "What an interesting place to go. I don\u2019t think a lot of people know about it as I heard by chance. You go through a dark tunnel that opens up into the huge cistern.Everything is explained thourghly. Try shouting and listen to your echo! Highly recommended to visit",
          "At the last day of our trip we visited the cistern during an exhibition of Native American chair embroidery and beadwork. I was intrigued by the detail, but didn\u2019t take any pics! We wandered the bayou amazed how high the debris reached after The Flood.",
          "This underground drinking water reservoir, built in the 1920s, is a wonder of engineering, light, and sound. Also a really interesting piece of Houston history. The tour guide was super informative. Absolutely worth your $5 and 30 minutes, especially if you\u2019re intrigued by",
          "I visited the cisterns in Istanbul first, and although the cisterns in Houston can't compete with ancient pillars, I had an eerie bit of deja vu among the underground rows of columns reflected in water. This tour is defiantly worth your time. Parking is easy, right at the",
          "This was a nice short tour on a hot summer day. Inside the cistern was quite comfortable. The guide shared a great deal of history about the cistern and the water supply of Houston. The tour is a walking tour, but is wheel chair accessible. We arrived early and walked upstairs,",
          "Many other reviewers found it underwhelming, but I found it intriguing for many reasons. First, it was something unique and different. My husband is a native Houstonian and I have been here over 50 years, so it was nice to be surprised by something that has been in our",
          "This is a quick, fascinating tour of the old Houston Water Storage facility that will remind you of the Cistern in Istanbul. Inexpensive at $2, but plan ahead - it gets sold out! The history is interesting, and the visuals are memorable. At the end, ASK for a second \"echo\". The",
          "For $10 bucks you get to visit a sensory themed experience. It was enjoyable yet, it didn't hold my attention tne entire 30 minutes. Creative yes. Affordable yes. Offers something new yes, would I do it again? Not certain. It is however a worthwhile experience because how often",
          "I feel fortunate to have seen the Rain immersive art experience at the Cistern. Unfortunately the last day was June 25th 2017 so unless they do it again, no one else will be able to see it there. The Cistern is an underground place that used to hold drinking water and it has",
          "This is a cool and easy place to visit if you are visiting downtown Houston. Sometimes they have art installations you can see inside the cistern, and sometimes you can just take a tour of the cistern. For those who don't know, a cistern is an underground water storage facility",
          "The light and sound show called \"RAIN\" made my second visit here unpleasant. We had told the 9 year-old grandson he would love it; he hated it. Boring lights and LOUD thunderstorm sounds that would not quit until we had circuited the place. Our first visit was a good view of",
          "Right in the middle of Buffalo Bayou Park, it is a great historic site. We saw a light show and it was awesome.",
          "We toured the Cistern in Istanbul, which IS amazing, so perhaps we had unrealistic expectations. After reading all the HYPE, we decided to tour the Houston Cistern. One word: DISAPPOINTING!! The \"Rain\" installation...YAWN. I kept expecting that the light show would develop",
          "Beautiful site, a hidden gem. Reservations required, light show fabulous but great treat anytime. Eerie sight, interesting guide tells the story, just recently found. Something different",
          "Went with some friends and we took a tour to hear all the facts and history of the Cistern. Then we saw the light show. It was great. It's something different and lots of fun. Groups are limited in size so get a reservation.",
          "I, also, went on a photography tour. Since it was my first time in the cistern it was a bit of a challenge to photograph but very beautiful and interesting. Unfortunately the hatches were not working the day day I was there. I did manage to get a few good photos and would",
          "Had this outing planned for a couple months. We did the photo tour. It accommodate 15 people on this photo tour so you can use your tripod. Very interesting, as you go in, your allowed 12 minutes on each wall. The tour takes one hour to complete. Cost for this tour",
          "The cistern with the accompanying light & sound show was an unexpected delight right under our nose. It was also a throwback to some of the early Houston growth. Fun \u00bd hour.",
          "The 'Rain' exhibition is art at its best - appealing to the senses - visual, sound, smell, movement and atmosphere. An extraordinary replication of heavy thunderstorms in an enclosed area with the lightning, thunder and then heavy rain echoing around the cistern. A must see,",
          "We went there expecting to see a wonderful underground cistern discovered in Houston several years ago. First of all our guide, Justin, talked so fast we could barely understand him and really gave us no history. Once we went into the cistern the lights were turned off almost",
          "For $10, you can make a reservation online to attend a 25 minute viewing of this special installation. It's a 116 second light and sound attraction inside the cistern that continuously loops the entire time. It got a bit boring to me. It's there till June. I had not been to",
          "The Buffalo Bayou Cistern is a historical place in Houston where they used to keep the water supply. It has been renovated as an attraction that can be toured and as a place for art to be exhibited. I visited while Rain by Magdalena Fern\u00e1ndez was on display. It was my first",
          "After seeing the one in Istanbul, my husband was unimpressed. I thought the docent did a great job explaining the history of the city's water supply. She spoke loud enough, walked backwards, started and ended on time. Good job! One of us recommends it and I'm writing the",
          "Discovering the Cistern system was a wonderful surprise, saw the Magdalena Fernandez exhibition and the whole family was in awe, if you are visiting Houston, don't miss it.",
          "The Cistern now has an underground light show entitled \"Rain\". Interesting, but too much of the same thing. My relatively poor review is because it was only the light show. Nothing about the history of the Cistern. I have since learned from their website that only for a",
          "Cool experience! A walk along the bayou in the bright daylight can be enhanced by the underground light show. Serene and soothing, if you appreciate art, this is for you, too.",
          "The visit is short, to the point and ever so much fun. Not at all what I expected. Be aware -- no one under 9 for good reasons.",
          "Visited today and really enjoyed it. Especially the beginning when the lights went out and it was absolutely quiet. You go to each corner and watch the performance. Cool! Little scary and architecturally beautiful. Nice 1/2 hour of time well-spent.",
          "This is a unique exhibit that I haven't seen elsewhere.. it takes place in an underground water reservoir (the Cistern) that was still being used as houston's water supply ten years ago. There are two types of tours conducted here. The first is a history tour of the Cistern",
          "What a fascinating place! We saw a special exhibit that mixed lighting and sound, which really enhanced the visit to the 1926 underground city reservoir (Rain: Magdalena Fern\u00e1ndez). The tour was perhaps a bit pricey, but it was interesting and a very quick visit. There is so",
          "The park is nice and the works they done are beautiful, but the rain show inside the edifice by artist Fernandez is not worth the money. the tour is void, i was told the history tour is more interesting but happens on certain days of the week only",
          "Take the tour. You will really enjoy and learn. Almost cultural and sensory overload. Many times better than what we expected. While it was highly recommended it exceeded and is truly a Must See.",
          "This was our first visit but won't be our last. Whether you are a native or long time Houstonian or a visitor, this is a must see tour. The exhibit in the cistern is called Rain: by Madgalena Fernandez is an amazing event that will delight your eyes and ears with the sound of",
          "When we lived in Houston, we never knew this place existed. On a recent visit, we visited the cistern. What an amazing space. It is currently interpreted with a sound and light exhibit, which was interesting, but too much. Half as much time on the art experience and a little",
          "The Cistern at Buffalo Bayou was built in the 20s to store water for the growing city of Houston. It continued to be used for a decades. It was once considered for use as a parking area, but it didn't serve. Now it has been cleaned up and made into a fascinating space for tours",

          "It looked like an interesting trip to go down in the cistern. It was clean and put together well. The rain was a light show on the water with the sound of rain playing in the background. Very serene and pleasant. I enjoyed it but some of the company wanted something more",
          "Redone old Cistern is neat to see but not very big. Go when there is a show such as \"Rain\" which we booked on line in advance. The show is a video and audio presentation that works off the interior of the Cistern. It is nice but not worth it if you have to travel far through",

          "Educational, fun and visually stunning.",
          "It was so amazing to experience the quiet stillness in the space. A much needed escape in the middle of the city!",
          "Great place to adventure outdoors with young ones! Slide is fun and musical stations were a hit.",
          "Good art installation. Don't expect to be impressed too much if you have visited other historic cisterns. Lot's of other activities in the area as well.",
          "this place is so cool!! my friend and i were looking for something to do in the middle of a hot Saturday afternoon and decided to finally make it out here! we booked tickets 10 minutes online before their scheduled tours and it was so cool to learn about the cistern with our guide down below",
          "Great spot for a lunch/brunch on the park.  The food is good, you can sit inside or outside, and there is plenty of seating to not feel rushed while you eat.  We also recommend a post-meal walk around the area as there are some neat things to check out.",
          "Clean restrooms and a place to rent bikes from the bike barn. They charge per hr or for the day (8hrs). There is also a skateboard park amidst the beautiful landscaped park.",
          "You need to make sure you make reservations before going especially on Thursday. If you are looking for a place to film a zombie apocalypse this would be the place. It\u2019s pretty trippy when you first walk in. Great place to go if it\u2019s 100 \u2026",
          "Amazing space and very cool when there's an exhibit on.",
          "Very impressed. The entire area where I walked and sat was clean. Beautiful views.",
          "Amazing place with amazing history. Our guide was fantastic. She knew lots about the cistern and the history of Houston. Well worth seeing. It's quite surreal when you inside",

          "My favorite place for a nice relaxing walk",
          "What a wonderful place to visit in Houston! V unusual history that has been preserved for us to enjoy.",
          "Really cool experience, guides give an interesting history of Houston's water supply and the place itself is surreal.",
          "This is a great guided tour, and a hidden gem. If you want to learn some Houston history and see an architectural masterpiece, don't skip this. Sometimes they have special art installations as well which is amazing.",
          "Great way to spend an hour, and a good history lesson for the city.",
          "I've walked on the lawn that is above the cistern without knowing where it actually was. The tour is a quick 20 to 25 minutes. Very interesting. Normally $5 per person but on Thursdays, it's free!",
          "This is one of the true hidden treasures of Houston, a must see!",
          "A very simple tour, but it was worth seeing in person.  The pictures do not do it justice.",
          "It's like being in a sensory tank? Only gigantic... the echo is amazing. Otherwise, it's so dim, serene, surreal, and naturally cool even during hot days... can't wait to go again for the immersive art installations.",
          "Took both the history and light show tour (a out 30 minutes each). Interesting and beautiful. Plan to go again.",
          "The cistern itself is interesting.  The art piece right now is very cool with all the moving lights.  I really enjoyed it.  The staff that take you in and at the visitor center were extremely friendly and welcoming. Overall, a very fun visit that is a little out of the ordinary.",
          "If you are looking for a unique experience in the Bayou City this is it.  We visited on free night Thursday (reserve tickets on the website).  The tour guide was very engaging while sharing the history of the cistern and its impact on the city water supply.",
          "One of the most amazing places I have ever been. Once held drinking water for Houston. Over 2 acers under roof. It's like a different world.",
          "Pretty neat experience. The cisterns are a great piece of Houston history. The art exhibit in them currently is wonderful. It's pretty pricey, but we were glad we went.",
          "This was our second time in this area for the Women's March. We drove all the way from Alvin and just love how Houston comes together. There was close free parking nearby and both times I felt really safe walking around. Houston is such a beautiful and diverse city! Love it!",
          "Definitely a cool history lesson on houston",
          "This park is always awesome. It's well maintained and beautiful.",
          "Photos and people talking about it don't do the art exhibit justice when visiting the cistern. If you have 45mins and $10, it's worth a visit.",
          "Hidden gem in Buffalo bayou. Very artistic, quick visit.",
          "Love this place, it always feels so nice to be outside and under the Houston skyline. Even at night it's quite a nice place to be.",
          "A very cool hidden gem in Houston. One of many hidden gems in out city. These were taken during the Carlos Cruz-Diez at the Cistern ezhibit:  Spatial Chromointerference\nOn view through January 13, 2019",
          "Perfect place to take pictures",
          "What a cool experience! Need a place to get the guests or visitors out of your house for an easy city outing? This is the place. A 30 minute expedition filled with mystery, science and history. Check it out but make a reservation online first.",
          "Took my son on the 'Unguided Tour' and loved it. Great experience. However if it's your first time going I recommend the 'Guided Tour'. A must see in Houston. Also I believe Thursdays are Free.",
          "Cool to go once if you have time and nothing else to do. But not the most exciting place I've been too",
          "I would NOT recommend the art tour. Imagine being underground in an amazing space - and turning off all the lights. That's the art tour.\n\nInstead wait around till the 6pm historical tour when they'll actually turn on the light so you can see something. Otherwise you might as well just throw your cash down in the cistern.",
          "A hidden gem that surprises teens that expect a boring field trip but always delivers.",
          "Another fun installation at the Cistern. A Houston hidden gem",
          "This place is cool...just the history of it is kind if ab interesting historical site for Houston. Then they do some art installations and the place is an all new experience... when guests come from out of town we like to take them \u2026",
          "Amazing example of civic design and infrastructure. Amazing repurposing. Cool public plaza. Great view of Houston skyline. The acoustics are bananas. 17 second reverberation.",
          "A must see in the heart of Houston.",
          "The Buffalo Bayou Park Cistern is such an awesome hidden treasure of Houston. It's beauty is outstanding but what makes it even more breath taking is the light shows they put on down there that just mesmorize you!  We have been telling all \u2026",
          "Very neat and educational tour that lasted about 20 minutes at a slow walk (~1/4 of a mile) that takes you clockwise around the outside edge of the cistern. At the end, you get to have some fun with the 17 second echo of the chamber, which \u2026",
          "It was ok. Is not that big.",
          "Excellent tour, very interesting story and location. Absolutely worth the price!",
          "Certainly worth it for $2. Learned a lot. I really can't complain since our guide was so nice and knowledgeable",
          "Being inside the cistern is actually quite surreal the first ... oh, 60 seconds.  After that the tour guide walks you around in a circle, talking a mile a minute. I couldn't even absorb what she was saying, she talked so fast. What I did \u2026",
          "This place is great for tourists and Houston natives! We learned some interesting history if our city's water usage and then followed it up with the art installation tour that really blew us away. Do both tours if you have the chance to see \u2026",
          "It's neat to see and I'm glad it's preserved but kind of boring.  Maybe 10 minutes is all that's needed.",
          "Very interesting tour with lots of facts about the history of the cisterns. Highly recommend.",
          "Very interesting tour and a little bit eerie inside!",
          "A super cool spot to learn about an unusual part of Houston\u2019s history. The art installations are really eccentric and neat. Great for unique photos, if you know how to work in low light. Thursday\u2019s are free!",
          "Born & raised in Houston and never knew about this place till now. Great spot to visit and learn a few things.",
          "Interesting piece of Houstons past. \nThey have guides (book online it's hard to walk up at the last minute)  \nOne weekend afternoon after 3  it's free or less, maybe Wed or Thurs when you hit buy tickets you will see the lesser price if it \u2026",
          "Lots of places for photo options. We had 13 adults and 5 kids under 6. There is a restroom available too.",
          "They let you yell and listen to the echo",
          "A great part \nThe bike trails are wonderful. Rent a Bike from the bike barn or B-Cycle which has locations available throughout the city. Affordable prices",
          "How cool is this place??!!??!! Definitly a spot to take visitors, or to go see yourself if you haven't yet. I felt like we were entering Moria with the tall columns and expansive space - both deceivingly so! Our guide gave a very \u2026",
          "Great quick company history tour of the Cistern. Nicely restored facilities.",
          "Literally a hidden gem along Buffalo Bayou. Great to see and learn about the backstory of Houston's infrastructure. Love how the cistern is repurposed to display artist work. Great place to spend an hour or so.",
          "Really cool historical tour of a former water system structure and reservoir",
          "Very cool place to visit hidden deep in Houston, it is a quick visit with not much else to see",
          "Really cool, huge, love the columns, Go winners in art show going on 20 23rd avenue art show anywhere from six months to a year",
          "Really great tour! Our guide was Steve. He was very knowledgeable. I will surely come again and bring family.",
          "Love this park. It's not well lit so I wouldn't be out there too late.",
          "This place is amazing! I'm sad it took me so long to get here, but everyone really must do the tour. It's cool (literally because it's underground) and so awesome to hear this unusual Houston history. I brought a friend who was visiting \u2026",
          "We took the tour during the artistic installation and loved it. We will definitely come back for an historic tour when they're offered. It was about 30 minutes and kicked off our day of exploring downtown. ",
          "Cool place! Interesting history lesson...",
          "I\u2019ve been twice now.   Both exhibits were pleasing but not spell-binding.   For first time Houston visitors, this isn\u2019t the must see of the city.   For people who live here or find themselves coming through, it is worth the visit to see how you take a giant flood cellar and turn it into something spooky, disorientating, yet entertaining.",
          "Really unique place! I really enjoyed the tour and  learning more about Houston's history.",
          "A great hidden (air conditioned!) respite from the sun with a bit of history and if you\u2019re lucky the occasional art installation too... Minimal tour costs can be booked online or onsite but best to book ahead, and if you have the time and not so much the money, Thursday tours are free! \ud83d\ude09",
          "Immersive art experience.",
          "Nice to be in a cool place when it's so hot and muggy outside. And, this place was neat!  Half hour walking tour learning about the history and planning for the water needs of a major metropolis. Favorite parts were at the end when the \u2026",
          "A fascinating structure with history, we enjoyed the historical tour most but the art installation did give a completely different interpretation of the space. The tour guide was informative and had a lively pleasant presence.",
          "Nice clean area",
          "Lovely outdoors area.  The Cistern is great art exhibit. It's a gem.",
          "A must and definitely off the beaten paths",
          "Such a unique site! Our guide was excellent too!",
          "Nice experience, but would be improved with a lowkey audio component added in.",
          "Beautiful! The artist has more of a psychodelic lighting.....not my favorite",
          "Cool experience ... a little different, but worth it.",
          "Seems neat, wierd hours, I haven't been able to go inside yet.",
          "It is interesting experience. Something not expected in Houston. I wish the tour has more essences into it. Overall it  took 20 min",
          "I recommend doing both the art tour and the history tour. Both are really cool.",
          "Been in Houston most of my life and had no idea this was here. Had a great time at the skate park next door and very cool experience under ground. We will bring our friends next time we are in the area. Great art exhibit as well.",
          "Great view of the city and fun natural looking playground set up for kids, but limited. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",
          "Awesome park with all activities and facilities.. Loved this park.. Good for all ages",
          "My crew and I love to explore different sights and sounds around Houston. We were interested in the seeing the Carlos Cruz -Diez  tour of the Cistern.  Unfortunately it wasn't all that we expected. I appreciate the concept, but it didn't seem that much of a tour or experience. As an art lover, I was a bit disappointed .",
          "Great park!",
          "A fun and beautiful experience. Have not done the Hostpry tour yet but the art exhibit is great!",
          "I live in Dallas, and I wish we had a park like it.  All around great experience.",
          "Nice relaxing place amongst the hustle and bustle of downtown.",
          "Really enjoyed my visit. Cool and damp way to get out of the heat!",
          "Very unique space in Houston that's inexpensive and fun for adults and kids. Great for a change of pace date or a family fun day at the park.",
          "Great way to beat the heat & learn about this cool underground space",
          "Reflection of colorful lights form patterns on the pillars and walls. With 10$ entry fees it\u2019s a good place to take pictures and show off artistic side of Houston to visitors.",
          "Nice setup",
          "Love this park, great scenery. Always new areas to explore and awesome trails to run.",
          "Very good tour, super informative and entertaining.  Really spooky, if you're into that, because it's so dark and vast and quiet.  It was quite an experience.",
          "Quick super cool underground tour",
          "I love biking here. Best place in houston to bike.",
          "Great park! The Cistern is really cool, especially if there's an art installation.",
          "Great place, also you have an ootion to rent a bike has an skate Park and also you can take amazing pictures",
          "Would highly recommend! It's a unique experience you can't get anywhere else. They have managed to turn the cistern into an artpiece. Just one of the many things you can do at Buffalo Bayou Park.",
          "Had the best time with my husband and walked 16 miles. Beautiful day",
          "Very interesting. Who knew this was here? It's also next to the skate park and that's always fun to watch, then take a stroll in the park.",
          "Interesting art exhibit and a nice walkthrough. Calm and cool",
          "The Bayou Cistern is massive lots of columns but I wish it wasn't so dark with the light at show..would love to go back when and if its light up ..need to see the structure real architectural beauty..",
          "This is by far my favorite park in Houston. Its great for getting in outdoor activity or just hanging out. You can ride bikes, canoe, skate. It's the best!",
          "Definitely worth going to see and with the light show held over until 4/7 I would say don't wait.",
          "Must see historical Houston architecture. Come when there is an art exhibit to fully experience the scale of this underground marvel.",
          "This is one of the best park of Houston. You can see city skylines from here. There are miles of trail for walking and cycling.",
          "These aren't the Roman aqueducts, but at least they are intact. Visited during an art installation this week and paid $10 for a 30min walk-through in a light show.  Explored perspective/vantage points/reflections above water/trippy illusions.",
          "A nice little nugget of Houston history, for a 2 dollar fee you get to learn about the cistern and also see it inside. Worth the visit, there is a moment you get to experience the 17 second echo the cistern can produce due to it's architecture. Fun and educational.",
          "Grateful that this gem is preserved for everyone to enjoy. The art installations are a so wonderful way to keep it relevant. They do a great job maintaining it!",
          "What a striking piece of urban architecture directly connected and inspired by the cistern in Istanbul!",
          "Excellent place for concerts. Just discovered there\u2019s more to do there; I will go there again.",
          "Cruz Diez pretty interesting... Nothing like I have seen before...",
          "Very interesting and echo(y)",
          "Wonderful place",
          "You get to walk around in a cistern that used to hold millions of gallons of water; very unique experience.",
          "What an amazing find. So glad to have seen it and experience the history and amazing 17 second echo.  Heard Pokemon even hide in here lol.  Fall of 2016 may bring tours to an end.  Thursdays are free...make reservations.",
          "Actually close at 5:30 as that is when the last tour leaves, and not 6 the posted time. Only way to view it is via a tour.",
          "This is definitely a must-visit for tourists and locals alike, especially if you can catch it while there is an art installation there. It\u2019s so beautiful, and is a whole other world just steps from the street.",
          "This place a hidden tourist gem packed with so much history! Remember to book you tickets in advance.",
          "It was an ok art exhibit. Can imagine a lot more ways to lay out this facility. Was cool to see the actual cistern.",
          "Fascinating piece of Houston history. The tour is very informative.",
          "Went while they had a cool light installation.  Very unique and neat thing to do in Houston!",
          "One of the most unique places in Houston.",
          "Very cool way to start a date night.  Something different is always a plus.",
          "I had a very good time over there",
          "Got 30 minutes of spare time then this is a must little tour and experience.",
          "Really nice place for out door activities with the family and friends.",
          "Very cool experience. Very immersive and feels like you're in a trippy different world. Opportunity for cool photos as well",
          "If you like walking around a dimly lit underground man made room with some 80's disco lights and white boxes placed randomly in the centre of the room then this will be right up your street!",
          "Great visit, it is a must visit place. Historical, former water storage.",
          "Great piece of history.",
          "Interesting but definitely only a 30 minutes max activity.",
          "Cool to see, light show wasn't all that exciting to me. Still enjoyed the visit overall.",
          "Spectacular contrast between green grass and trees against glass, steel and concrete of Houston skyscrapers.  Beautiful park.",
          "We went and saw the spatial chromointerference not really knowing what to expect. It was facinating and I'm glad we stumbled upon it!!",
          "Lovely walk in downtown Houston. Art along the way and though we missed the cistern this trip we did see the bats!",
          "Great little known piece of Houston. Tucked in below buffalo bayou park, next to the skate park. Perfect for a family outing or a date. \n\nThe tour guides are friendly and knowledgeable and you will come away with some great pictures\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone, and be sure to get a reservation",
          "Very interesting and fun.",
          "The tour is short mainly because there isn\u2019t too much to see. The installation is cool but not that worth the ticket price.",
          "Great space, and the art exhibit is really cool",
          "Really Pretty but super small circle you walk around. The area outside it beautiful!!!",
          "The 'art' was a kaleidoscope of colors on a projector. Then, we're told the artist has requested silence during the exhibit. Some guy was making echo noises and instead of approaching him to make him stop, the lights were flicked on and we \u2026",
          "Realy nice place",
          "Very unique place. Light show they commissioned for summer 2018 makes it more interesting",
          "Beautiful historic space - something so rare in Houston - with a very informative short tour. I think this rehabilitation is a testament to our growing acceptance of historic preservation and good urban space. Also, the instructions aren't \u2026",
          "Had an awesome tour guide!",
          "Beautiful! Very interesting and peaceful. Bring a sweater!",
          "I just big enough to have fun, I love it ...",
          "The history tour has got to be better than the art installation.  The self guided art installation tour is dulll,  not very creative.  The cistern is a great space to explore sound and the art installation is meant to be viewed in silence, a missed opportunity.",
          "It was cool and we got the tickets for free so it was a great deal.",
          "Great place for events or even just a walk",
          "Great details from a bygone era and a unique aspect of a major American city. Water facts rule.",

          "I brought some out of town guests expecting to get a history tour, what we got instead was an \"art\" installation. After making our way out as fast as possible, I went to ask for a refund because the art installation was not only a joke, but \u2026",
          "It is a great Park to relax at and enjoy walking through. I love the atmosphere around the park as well as the people.",
          "Kinda pricey for 30 minutes, but the AC was nice and enjoyed the show.",

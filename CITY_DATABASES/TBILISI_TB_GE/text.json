        "wiki": "Tbilisi (English:  t\u0259-bih-LEE-see, t\u0259-BIL-ih-see; Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 [t\u02b0bilisi] (listen)), in some countries also still known by its pre-1936 international designation, Tiflis ( TIF-lis), is the capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of approximately 1.5 million people. Tbilisi was founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tbilisi was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy, governing both Southern and Northern Caucasus.\nBecause of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global powers. The city's location to this day ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and the Modern structures.\nHistorically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though it is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Its notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from 20 to 32 \u00b0C (68 to 90 \u00b0F) in the summer and 7 to \u22121 \u00b0C (45 to 30 \u00b0F) in the winter.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe name Tbilisi derives from Old Georgian t\u2032bilisi (Asomtavruli: \u10b2\u10a1\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8\u10b1\u10a8, Mkhedruli: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8), and further from tpili (Modern Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8, 'warm', itself from Old Georgian: \u10b2\u10b4\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8 \u1e6dpili). The name T\u2032bili or T\u2032bilisi (literally, 'warm location') was therefore given to the city because of the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs.\nUntil 1936, the name of the city in English and most other languages was Tiflis, while the Georgian name was \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 (Tpilisi).On 17 August 1936, by order of the Soviet leadership, the official Russian names of various cities were changed to more closely match the local language. In addition, the Georgian-language form T\u2032pilisi was modernized on the basis of a proposal by Georgian linguists; the ancient Georgian component \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (tpili, 'warm') was replaced by the newer \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (t\u2032bili). This form was the basis for a new official Russian name (\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438 Tbilisi).  Most other languages have subsequently adopted the new name form, but some languages such as Turkish, Persian, Greek, and German have retained a variation of Tiflis.\nOn 20 September 2006, the Georgian parliament held a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the renaming.\nSome of the traditional names of Tbilisi in other languages of the region have different roots.  The Ossetian name \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a (Kalak) derives from the Georgian word \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e5\u10d8 (kalaki) meaning simply 'town'. Chechen and Ingush names for the city use a form similar to or the same as their names for the country of Georgia (\u0413\u0443\u044c\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0445 G\u00fcr\u01b6ex) as does the historical Kabardian name (\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0436\u044b Kwrd\u017e\u0259), while Abkhaz \u049a\u0430\u0440\u04ad (\u0136ar\u0163) is from the Mingrelian \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8 (Karti).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi since the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age. During the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus. According to legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted variant of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King Vakhtang I of Iberia (r. c. 447/49 \u2013 502/22) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either a hawk or other small birds of prey in the legend). The King's falcon allegedly caught or injured a pheasant during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died from burns. King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and build a city on the location.\nKing Dachi of Iberia (r. 522\u2013534), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved the capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries. From the 6th century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region's strategic location along important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.\n\n\n=== Foreign domination ===\n\nTbilisi's favorable trade location, however, did not necessarily bode well for its survival. Located strategically in the heart of the Caucasus between Europe and Asia, Tbilisi became an object of rivalry among the region's various powers such as the Roman Empire, Parthia, Sassanid Persia, Muslim Arabs, the Byzantine Empire, and the Seljuk Turks. The cultural development of the city was somewhat dependent on who ruled the city at various times, although Tbilisi was fairly cosmopolitan.\nFrom 570\u2013580, the Persians ruled the city until 627, when Tbilisi was sacked by the Byzantine/Khazar armies and later, in 736\u2013738, Arab armies entered the town under Marwan II. After this point, the Arabs established an emirate centered in Tbilisi. In 764, Tbilisi \u2013 still under Arab control \u2013 was once again sacked by the Khazars. In 853, the armies of Arab leader Bugha Al-Turki invaded Tbilisi in order to enforce its return to Abbasid allegiance. The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050. In 1068, the city was once again sacked, only this time by the Seljuk Turks under Sultan Alp Arslan.\n\n\n=== Capital of Georgia ===\nIn 1121, after heavy fighting with the Seljuks, the troops of the King of Georgia David IV of Georgia besieged Tbilisi, which ended in 1122 and as a result David moved his residence from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State and thus inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age. From 12\u201313th centuries, Tbilisi became a regional power with a thriving economy and astonishing cultural output. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and a cultural center not only for Georgia but for the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. During Queen Tamar's reign, Shota Rustaveli worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. This period is often referred to as \"Georgia's Golden Age\" or the Georgian Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Mongol domination and the following period of instability ===\nTbilisi's \"Golden Age\" did not last for more than a century. In 1226, Tbilisi was captured by the Khwarezmian Empire Shah Jalal ad-Din and its defences severely devastated and prone to Mongol armies. In 1236, after suffering crushing defeats to the Mongols, Georgia came under Mongol domination. The nation itself maintained a form of semi-independence and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi was strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols retreated from Georgia and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state once again. An outbreak of the plague struck the city in 1366.\nFrom the late 14th until the end of the 18th century, Tbilisi came under the rule of various foreign invaders once again and on several occasions was completely burnt to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was invaded by the armies of Tamerlane. In 1444, the city was invaded and destroyed by Jahan Shah (the Shah of the town of Tabriz in Persia). From 1477 to 1478 the city was held by the Ak Koyunlu tribesmen of Uzun Hassan.\n\n\n=== Iranian control ===\n\nAs early as the 1510s, Tbilisi (and the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) were made vassal territories of Safavid Iran. In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force. Following the death of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524), king David X of Kartli expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards. With the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of vali. Under the later rules of Teimuraz II and Heraclius II, Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule\u2014but, fearful of the constant threat of invasion, Georgia's rulers sought Russian protection in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Despite this agreement, the city was captured and devastated in 1795 by the Iranian Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who sought to re-establish Iran's traditional sovereignty over the region.\n\n\n=== Russian control ===\n\nIn 1801, the Russian Empire annexed the Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (of which Tbilisi was the capital), later cementing its rule with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, which ended Iranian control of Georgia. Tbilisi became the center of the Tbilisi Governorate (Gubernia). Russian Imperial administrators implemented a new European-style city plan and commissioned new buildings in Western styles. Roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in the Russian Empire, such as Batumi and Poti. By the 1850s, Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and a cultural center. The likes of Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Iakob Gogebashvili, Alexander Griboyedov and many other statesmen, poets and artists all found their home in Tbilisi. The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov, the Romanov family and others. The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day Rustaveli Avenue), on which the Viceroys of the Caucasus established their residence. For much of the 19th century, Tbilisi's largest ethnic group was Armenian, who, at some point, formed 74.3% of the population.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Brief independence ===\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city served as a location of the Transcaucasus interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent Transcaucasian Federation with the capital in Tbilisi. At this time, Tbilisi had roughly the same number of Armenians as Georgians, with Russians being the third largest ethnic group. It was here, in the former Caucasus Vice royal Palace, where the independence of three Transcaucasus nations \u2013 Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2013 was declared on 26 to 28 May 1918. After this, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until 25 February 1921. From 1918 to 1919 the city was also consecutively home to a German and British military headquarters.\nUnder the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian University City after the Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918. On 25 February 1921, the Bolshevist Russian 11th Red Army invaded Tbilisi and after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city, declared Soviet rule.\n\n\n=== Soviet rule ===\n\nIn 1921, the Democratic Republic of Georgia was occupied by the Soviet Bolshevik forces from Russia, and until 1936 Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the Transcaucasian SFSR (which included Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), and afterwards until 1991 as the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized, and it also came to be an important political, social, and cultural centre of the Soviet Union. In 1980 the city housed the first state-sanctioned rock festival in the USSR. As a major tourist destination for both Soviet citizens and foreign visitors, Tbilisi's \"Old Town\" (the neighborhoods within the original city walls) was reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s.Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the 9 March Massacre, in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of Nikita Khrushchev. Peaceful protests occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the April 9 tragedy was a peaceful protest that turned violent.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nSince the break-up of the Soviet Union, Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war, which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-Gamsakhurdia and Opposition forces clashed), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations among various mafia clans and illegal business operators. Even during the Shevardnadze Era (1993\u20132003), crime and corruption became rampant at most levels of society. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the Rose Revolution. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with decreasing crime rates, an improved economy, and a real estate boom. During the 2008 South Ossetia war, the Tbilisi area was hit by multiple Russian air attacks.\nAfter the war, several large-scale projects were started, including a streetcar system, a railway bypass and a relocation of the central station, and new urban highways. In June 2015, a flood killed at least twelve people and caused animals from the city's zoo to be released into the streets.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\nThe status of Tbilisi, as the nation's capital, is defined by the Article 10 in the Constitution of Georgia (1995) and the Law on Georgia's Capital \u2013 Tbilisi (20 February 1998).Tbilisi is governed by the Tbilisi City Assembly (Sakrebulo) and the Tbilisi City Hall (Meria). The City Assembly and mayor are elected once every four years by direct elections. The Mayor of Tbilisi is Kakha Kaladze and the Chairman of the Tbilisi city Assembly is Giorgi Alibegashvili.\n\nAdministratively, the city is divided into raions (districts), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general subdivision of the Soviet Union. Since Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:\n\nMtatsminda District Including Neighborhoods: Mtatsminda, Sololaki, Vera, Kiketi, Kojori, Shindisi, Tsavkikisi, Tabakhmela\nVake District Including Neighborhoods: Vake, Bagebi, Vazha Pshavela Quarters, Nutsubidze Plateau, Tskneti\nSaburtalo District Including Neighborhoods: Delisi, Vedzisi, Vashlijvari, Bakhtrioni, Khiliani, Didi Dighomi, Zurgovana\nKrtsanisi District Including Neighborhoods: Kala, Ortachala, Ponichala\nIsani District Including Neighborhoods: Avlabari, Navtlughi, Metromsheni, Vazisubani, Eighth Legioni\nSamgori District Including Neighborhoods: Varketili, Third Array, Orkhevi, Dampalo, Lilo, Lower Samgori\nChughureti District Including Neighborhoods: Chughureti, Kukia, Svanetisubani\nDidube District Including Neighborhoods: Didube, Didghomi Massive\nNadzaladevi District Including Neighborhoods: Nadzaladevi, Sanzona, Temka, Lotkini, Old Nadzaladevi\nGldani District Including Neighborhoods: Gldani Massive, Avchala, Mukhiani, GldanulaMost of the raions are named after historic quarters of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognise an informal system of smaller historic neighbourhoods. Such neighbourhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the Right Bank and the Left Bank of the Mt'k'vari. The names of the oldest neighbourhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.\nIn pre-Revolution Tiflis, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:\n\nIn the north part of the town, on the left bank of the Kur\u00e1 and to the south of the railway station, stretches the clean German Quarter, formerly occupied by German immigrants from W\u00fcrttemberg (1818). To the south is the Gruzinian or Georgian Quarter (Avlab\u00e1r). On the right bank of the Kur\u00e1 is the Russian Quarter, the seat of the officials and of the larger business firms. This is adjoined on the south by the Armenian and Persian Bazaars.\nAvlabari is considered \"the integral component of the so-called 'old Tbilisi'\" and is the object of planning and cultural heritage preservation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nTbilisi is located in the South Caucasus at 41\u00b0 43' North Latitude and 44\u00b0 47' East Longitude. The city lies in Eastern Georgia on both banks of the Mt'k'vari River. The elevation of the city ranges from 380\u2013770 metres above sea level (1,250\u20132,530 ft) and has the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the Saguramo Range, to the east and south-east by the Iori Plain, to the south and west by various endings (sub-ranges) of the Trialeti Range.\nThe relief of Tbilisi is complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Mt'k'vari River extends for more than 30 km (19 mi) from the Avchala District to River Lochini. The part of the city which lies on the right side of the Mt'k'vari River, on the other hand, is built along the foothills of the Trialeti Range, the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river Mt'k'vari. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on the right bank of the Mt'k'vari River. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.\nTo the north of the city, there is a large reservoir (commonly known as the Tbilisi Sea) fed by irrigation canals.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTbilisi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with considerable continental and semi-arid influences. The city experiences very warm summers and moderately cold winters. Like other regions of Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry period. The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and oceanic (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild microclimate compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.\nThe average annual temperature in Tbilisi is 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). January is the coldest month with an average temperature of 2.3 \u00b0C (36.1 \u00b0F). July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24.9 \u00b0C (76.8 \u00b0F). Daytime high temperatures reach or exceed 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) on an average of 22 days during a typical year.  The absolute minimum recorded temperature is \u221224.4 \u00b0C (\u221211.9 \u00b0F) in January 1883 and the absolute maximum is 42.0 \u00b0C (107.6 \u00b0F) on 17 July 1882. Average annual precipitation is 495.5 mm (19.5 in). May is the wettest month (averaging 77.6 mm (3.1 in) of precipitation) while January is the driest (averaging 18.9 mm (0.7 in) of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15\u201325 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs a multicultural city, Tbilisi is home to more than 100 ethnic groups. Around 89% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azerbaijanis. Along with the above-mentioned groups, Tbilisi is home to other ethnic groups including Ossetians, Abkhazians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Germans, Jews, Estonians, Kurds, Assyrians & Yazidis, and others.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nMore than 95% of the residents of Tbilisi practise some form of Christianity (the most predominant of which is the Georgian Orthodox Church). The Russian Orthodox Church, which is in Full communion with the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church have significant followings as well. A minority of the population (around 1.5%) practises Islam (mainly Shia Islam), while about 0.1% of Tbilisi's population practises Judaism. There is also a Roman Catholic church and the Yazidi Sultan Ezid Temple.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nUp until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding (polo in particular), wrestling, boxing, and marksmanship were the most popular city sports. Influence from the Russian Empire brought more Western sports and activities (billiards, fencing) to Tbilisi.\nThe Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary sports infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 handball arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the Dinamo Arena (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium (24,680 seats). The Sports Palace which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat approximately 11,000 people.\nVere Basketball Hall is a smaller indoor sports arena with a 2,500 seating capacity.\nThe most popular sports in Tbilisi today are football, rugby union, basketball, and wrestling. Also, popular sports include tennis, swimming and water polo. There are several professional football and rugby teams as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. National Basketball Association players Zaza Pachulia and Nikoloz Tskitishvili are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.\nTbilisi's signature football team, Dinamo Tbilisi, has not won a major European championship since the 1980\u20131981 season, when it won the European UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the Euroleague in 1962 but also never repeated any such feat.\nTbilisi will host several Group Phase matches for the EuroBasket 2021 in the country, Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne) and Italy (Milan).\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe large majority of Georgia's media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular Rustavi 2 television channel which gained considerable fame after its coverage of the Rose Revolution. In addition to Rustavi 2, the remaining three out of the four major public television channels of Georgia (including Imedi TV Maestro and the Public Broadcasting Channel) are based in the city. Tbilisi's television market has experienced notable changes since the second half of 2005 when Rustavi 2 successfully bought out the Mze TV company and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation became a shareholder of Imedi Media Holding at the beginning of 2006.\nTbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily 24 Saati (\"24 Hours\"), Rezonansi (\"Resonance\"), Alia, the English-language daily The Messenger, weekly FINANCIAL, Georgia Today, and the English-language weekly The Georgian Times. Out of the city's radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 FM), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.\nRadio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and Byzantine, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Beaux-Arts, Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles. Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801\u20131917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.\nTbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically-inflected Stalinist architecture in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building (\"Imeli\"), now housing the Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi.[2]\n\nTbilisi's postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union's most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi's 1975 Ministry of Roads and the 1984 Wedding Palace. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout \"kamikaze loggia\" overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Soon Tbilisi will have three skyscraper complexes. The Axis Towers, Redix Chavchavadze 64, and the new Ajara Hotel/Business Complex, which is currently under construction, will be the tallest buildings/skyscrapers in the Caucasus.[3]\n\n\n=== Theatre, dance and music ===\n\nThe city has important theatre and music institutions, such as the Tbilisi State Conservatoire, the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre, and the Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre.\n\n\n=== Arts museums and galleries ===\nThe Georgian National Museum gathers several important museums, including the Art Museum of Georgia. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 2012. Two independent contemporary art organisations, Kunsthalle Tbilisi and Open Space of Experimental Art, were founded in 2018.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nTbilisi has important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The Parliament and the government (State Chancellery) buildings of Georgia, the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Sameba Cathedral, the Vorontsov's Palace (also known as the Children's Palace today), the National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia, Tbilisi Circus, The Bridge of Peace, and many state museums are in Tbilisi. During the Soviet times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top four cities in the Soviet Union for the number of museums.\nOut of the city's historic landmarks, the most notable are the Narikala fortress (4th\u201317th century), Anchiskhati Basilica (6th century, built up in the 16th century), Sioni Cathedral (8th century, later rebuilt), and Church of Metekhi, Open Air Museum of Ethnography, Sulfur Bath, and Tbilisi Old City.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nBeyond traditional attractions, Tbilisi has developed burgeoning nightclub culture which started to attract international media attention in the 2010s. The leading clubs such as Bassiani, Mtkvarze, Khidi, and Caf\u00e9 Gallery have featured major international DJs as well as local performers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nWith a GDP at basic prices of 12,147 million Georgian lari (\u20ac4.3 billion) in 2014, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating almost 50 percent of Georgia's GDP. The service sector, including government services, is dominating and contributes 88 percent to GDP. Its GDP per capita of 10,336 Georgian lari (\u20ac3,600) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent. The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi's GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is \u2013 with 22.5 percent \u2013 significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nShota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport is Tbilisi's only international airport, located about 18 kilometres (11 miles) southeast of the city center. Handling 3.16 million passengers in 2017, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the seventeenth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56 million passengers in 11 months of 2018. It is a hub for the National carrier Georgian Airways and a Georgian-Chinese start-up Myway Airlines. \nAs of December 2018, various airlines serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as: London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Vienna, Paris, Doha etc.\nTbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first \"green airport\" in the Caucasus region in 2008.\nNatakhtari Airfield, located 33 km north of Tbilisi in the town of Natakhtari, is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to Batumi, Mestia and Ambrolauri.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tbilisi Metro serves the city with rapid transit subway services. It was the Soviet Union's fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966. The system operates two lines, the Akhmeteli-Varketili Line and the Saburtalo Line. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00 am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.\nThe third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and Tbilisi International Airport with a possible extension to Rustavi, 30 km east of Tbilisi.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nTbilisi had a tram network, since 1883 starting from horse-driven trams and from 25 December 1904 electric tramway. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, electric transport went to a degradation state within the years and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006 together with two trolleybus lines which were left. There are plans to construct a modern tram network.\n\n\n=== Minibus ===\nThe most dominant form of transportation is the minibus. An elaborate minibus system has grown in Tbilisi over the recent years. In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 tetri in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets, they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever he likes.\n\n\n=== Municipal bus ===\nThe second largest form of transportation are the municipal buses which are operated by Tbilisi Transport Company. As of October 2018, 672 buses of various size are servicing the city, majority of them are Ukrainian Bogdan A144 and A092 models along with 143 energy-efficient MAN Lion's City buses. New MAN Lion's City buses were put in service in 2017. Later in 2018, the tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta trucks&Buses won the tender and will be delivering aforementioned order in early 2019. In October 2018, at the Georgian Dream conference, it was announced that all the buses will be changed with new ones by the end of 2019, out of which 90 will be electric. Moreover, Kaladze asserted, that by 2020, Tbilisi will have 200 electric buses and the total number will reach 900.\n\n\n=== Aerial tramways ===\nHistorically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but all of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nSince 2012, Tbilisi has a modern, high-capacity gondola lift which operates between Rike Park and the Narikala fortress; each gondola can carry up to 8 persons. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner Ropeways.Since October 12, 2016, Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects Vake Park with Turtle Lake.\nSince October 2016, another Soviet-era aerial tramway between State University (Maglivi) and University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) is being reconstructed after 13 years of abandonment and is due for opening in April 2018. The original Italian-produced cabins produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti & Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, are being kept as well as the stations.\nDue to mismanagement at the hands of Soviet authorities, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.\n\n\n=== Funicular ===\nTbilisi funicular reopened 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built 1905, connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park, and covering almost 300 m (980 ft) in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower as well as some amusement rides, including a roller-coaster and a ferris wheel.\nThe half-way station of the funicular is just a short way away from Mtatsminda Pantheon, providing easy access to the necropolis.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognised medical education system. The biggest Georgian university is Tbilisi State University which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region. Over 35,000 students are enrolled and the number of faculty and staff (collaborators) is approximately 5,000. Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in Caucasus region \u2013 Tbilisi State Medical University, which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since that university operates as an independent educational institution, TSMU became one of the high-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. There are almost 5000 undergraduate and 203 postgraduate students at the university of whom 10% come from foreign countries.\nGeorgia's main and largest technical university, Georgian Technical University, is in Tbilisi. Georgian Technical University was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by the world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It achieved University status by 1990. The three most popular private higher educational institution in Georgia \u2014The University of Georgia (Tbilisi), Caucasus University, and the Free University of Tbilisi \u2013 are in Tbilisi.\n\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi) is the largest private University in Georgia, with more than 3500 international and local students. It was established in 2005 and soon became a market leader within Georgian educational sector. In 2010, the UG received financing from OPIC (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) for a development of the University's infrastructure and technical equipment. The University of Georgia has various undergraduate and graduate programs and it's the first company in Georgia which offers international certificate programs of the Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Zend technologies and Cisco Academy.\nCaucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB) (established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA). The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through the merger of two higher education schools: European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA). Today Free University comprises three schools \u2014 Business School (ESM), Institute of Asia and Africa and Law School \u2014 delivering academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels. In addition, Free University conducts a wide array of short-term courses and runs several research centers and summer school programs.\nHigher educational institutions in Tbilisi:\n\nTbilisi State University\nIlia State University\nGeorgian Technical University\nTbilisi State Conservatory\nShota Rustaveli Theatre and Film University\nTbilisi State Academy of Arts\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi)\nTbilisi State Medical University\nCaucasus University\nCaucasus International University\nTbilisi Medical Academy\nFree University of Tbilisi\nGrigol Robakidze University \u2013 Alma Mater\nGeorgian American University\nInternational Black Sea University\nGeorgian Institute of Public Affairs\nAgricultural University of Georgia\nInternational School of Economics (ISET)\nThe University of Geomedi\nNew Vision University\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Living in Tbilisi ==\nTbilisi is home to many foreigners. The number of foreigners living and working in Tbilisi has risen in recent years together with the openings of international schools, businesses, expat's communities, and online networks. Tbilisi is a very safe city. Most of the expatriates are living in Vake, Vera, Saburtalo, and Dighomi. A lot of expatriate communities could be found in Tbilisi. Some of them are charging a membership fee.\nIWA, International Women Association  is a non profit organisation founded in 1996 and its members and participants are International and Georgian women.\nExpats in Tbilisi is an Online Support Network founded by UN and EU Staff Spouses in Georgia Country to support expatriates in finding information and all relevant resources in one place.\nInter-nation International\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTbilisi is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAbo Tbileli, the patron saint of Tbilisi\nBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline\nList of Tbilisians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\nPostcard from the Silk Road -(Georgia), TRAVELS \u2013 ESPECIALLY FOR \u201eZNAD WILII\u201d, Leonard Dro\u017cd\u017cewicz, \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d, Vie\u0161oji \u012fstaiga \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d kult\u016bros pl\u0117tros draugija,ISSN 1392-9712 indeks 327956 nr 1 (57) z 2014 r., pp. 87\u201398, (in Polish)http://www.znadwiliiwilno.lt/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Znad-Wilii-57m.pdf\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the City of Tbilisi",

          "If you walk down from the castletop to the botanical gardens you run almost downhill into a booth where you have to pay an entrance fee. The Botanical garden is not easily accessible, we were looking for this place for two days, but there are many other attractions on the way",
          "A very nice place to have a calm walk in a maze of tracks. A good collection of plants, a waterfall and a Japanese garden. Unfortunately, the greenhouse was already closed (we were in the afternoon there).",

          "Full of attractions and even an hotel this botanical garden gives a romantic vibe on one side and an adventure on the other with its little niches for nature adoring or a zip line and a climbing rock on the other",
          "Even though it is probably a hugely important botanical site, there was a lack of maps, demarkation of the different planted areas,directional signage, guidance,instructions. It is an oasis of calm and coolness in the city. I was looking forward to seeing the orangery but it was",
          "These gardens were very near to our apartment in Tbilisi. We travelled on the cable car up to the fortress and entered the gardens at the top. We walked around the gardens, taking. In the waterfall and cultivated area with the fountain and the conifer section. We could have",

          "A pleasant walk on a hot day and a good activity to combine with a trip up on the cable car, down through the Garden and then up to the fort. A bit over it's \"sell by\" date, as it was once quite nice, fell into dis-repair in the post Soviet period and is only now slowly",
          "Heard about it alot but we left disappointed. Not so many things to see inside. Japanese garden but no so good. There is one waterfall which is good though and you can take some photos. There 2 ways to reach one from by road and one from narikala Fortress you can come down.",
          ".. on a wet dank, dreary, dismal day - not so much a Botanic Garden, more of an arboretum as it seems to be mainly trees!!!",
          "I've been twice to this place in three years and still want to visit again better to go up with the cable train and come done from the back side of the garden",
          "The park doesn't really make you think of a botanical garden. There's not really any description of different plants. There's a waterfall but basically that's it. So not worth the price.",
          "Not your typical botanical garden. Beautiful hiking area & views. We started from Mother Georgia & came down to lower exit towards old Tbilisi streets. Beautiful. Its rare to be able to hike in botanical garden, in city center of the capital. Must visit in Tbilisi. Do take time",
          "We were not impressed by anything, the garden requires better maintenance and more investment to look appealing to visitors. It was not worth the visit.",
          "Nice botanical garden..nothing very different from other similar gardens you might see around the world...interesting and various plants....And a very beautiful waterfall around which you can see children playing and swimming! Visit the place if you have time...Recommended",
          "The botanical garden is situated in the gorge that closes Tbilisi to the South. The idea is great, but it misses badly two things: water, and money. A modest investment could turn it into a gem.",
          "I had the luck to see at at night during the LIGHT FESTIVAL - it was a special evening - there were Djs in the garden, food pavilions, dance shows and so many attraction - if you have the chanse - visit there",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit in good weather. You have amazing views of the city. Be sure to walk to the Waterfall.",
          "These Botanical Gardens are a bit underwhelming, and probably due to under funding. There are some well established and attractive trees, but few floral displays/ borders. Having said that It is still worth a visit to wander in the summer shade",
          "I make a point of visiting botanical gardens everywhere I go. This one was massive, but the signage very poor. Miniature Japanese garden. Fee to enter after walking down many stairs. People at the various gates not helpful. No map to guide. Good bathroom.",

          "Visited here in mid May, maybe it was too early in the year but everything was still a little flat. The gardens were well organised, nice clear paths and tidy gardens with the additions of the Japanese garden and other similar small folly etc. This may be doing an injustice for",

          "I love nature and find that botanical gardens can be a let down: they are often either poorly maintained or they are so well maintained that nature seems to have been eradicated. Neither of this is the case with this one. The park itself is large and well maintained, and as",
          "What a beautiful garden, its really Lovely with waterfalls, flowers, different gardens, bridges. We took the cable car to the Narikala Fortress and its next to the botanic garden. You can do both in one time, the garden costs 4 gel like \u20ac1.",
          "Unbelievable that this garden is in the heart of the city. A must visit for nature enthusiasts, it\u2019s not included in usual tours. The public toilets at the reception need better maintenance , there was no light, no attendants when we visited. However the walk through waterfalls,",

          "I was content with the view of these gardens from the entrance at Narikala fortress. Looked like a fairly typical park and with limited time and so much to see in Tbilisi, one needs to be selective.",

The fortress consists of two walled sections on a steep hill between the sulfur baths and the botanical gardens of Tbilisi. On the lower court there is the recently restored St Nicholas church. Newly built in 1996\u20131997, it replaces the original 13th-century church that was destroyed in a fire. The new church is of \"prescribed cross\" type, having doors on three sides. The internal part of the church is decorated with the frescos showing scenes both from the Bible and history of Georgia.The structure was established in the 4th century as a Sasanian citadel called Shuris-tsikhe (i.e., \"Invidious Fort\"). It was considerably expanded by the Umayyads in the 7th century and by king David the Builder (1089\u20131125), respectively. The Mongols renamed it the \"Narin Qala\" (i.e., \"Little Fortress\"). Most of extant fortifications date from the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1827, parts of the fortress were damaged by an earthquake, and were subsequently demolished.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNarikala on YouTube\nNarikala on Geocities\nNarikala on World66\nNarikala on the official website of the City of Tbilisi",

          "Historic fortress with wonderful views. Now mostly just the old walls that have been restored to some degree, but you do get a good sense of how important these fortifications were over the centuries to protect Tbilisi from attacks. I recommend taking the cable car up and then",
          "I'd suggest taking the cable car to the top and walking down, as it is a long and steep trek up to the fortress from Old Town. The view from the top offers a panoramic view of the city below.",

          "Get off the cable car look at it's ruins or take a picture. Maybe Ive seen one too many fortress in Eastern Europe but it's nothing to see",
          "The Narikala Fortress has a lot of history and a great view of Tbilisi! We chose to walk up instead of the cable car as a result of some in the family not liking cable cars. The walk was very steep and directional signs were not clear, we got lost twice! Once at the top, the",
          "I stayed nearby to Narikala. I've visited this place maybe 5 times during my 25 days of stay in Tbilisi. This place is a good place to stretch your legs and hike. You can go there by walk or cable car. On the way to Narikala you will pass by Georgian houses and shops which are",
          "There is very little left or this fortress to see and hardly worth the effort walking up to it.......",

          "The fortress is now just the exterior walls but you can walk/hike around them and the views of the city are great. I took the cable car up and walked down. The cable car was fun with great views.",
          "Took the cable car to the top and first centred around the Kartlis Deda and the amusement park. Then walked to the opposite side to see the Narikala Fortress. After some of the recent high spots, i was a little disappointed in that it didn't really offer that much. Parts seemed",

          "Not as interesting as expected but worth a try if you are around its location. I remember the view of the city from there was excellent",
          "Not exactly the safest place to wander around. There are no guard rails to protect you from falling off the wall if you venture up the steps. Was told the nobody was hurt yet. I certainly had to be careful not to be part of a new statistic.",
          "You can either walk up to this fort or catch the Ropeway Funicular one or both ways. We chose to ride up and take the relative easy walk back down through the gardens, (Botanical gardens are here too). The \u2018wall\u2019 of the fort is in good condition, enabling you to climb the",
          "Just jump on the cable car on the opposite side of the river and enjoy the panoramic views of the old town as you get to the fortress. You can walk to the Mother Georgia statue and then go back to the ruins for a good look around. It is easy to walk up to the very top. The views",
          "This is an ancient fortress subsequently destroyed and now largely in ruins. There are two walled sections and an restored church. There is more history to feel here than to see. But it does provide a superb view over the city.",
          "This needs more attention love and care But spectacular A small entry fee would enable protection and preservation Ohh and toilets for visitors unless I missed them! There are two portable ones outside run privately didn't visit",
          "The fortress is completely uninteresting. The view is good, but that is a quality of the hill and the moutain lift to get there, not of the fortress as such",
          "This a free place to enter and just as well as very little is left. If you are young and foolhardy you can walk to the very top of the ruins. There was no way that I could do that and so had to satisfy myself in the lowest part of the castle. The views from the walls are",
          "The construction of this fortress is awesome, and we heard about the history of the place. Worth visiting. The views are spectacular, too.",
          "Worth a trip up the mountain to get the beautiful view of the city. You maybe tempted to use the cable car but, I would highly recommend you walk up the mountain. First impression it\u2019s too steep to walk up but as you pass along the houses in the mountain you realise you have",
          "Easy climb via the Lady of Georgia and a walk along the rim of the hill. Many locals come here. Part is a ruin and part is restored. Good views. For those who do not like to climb there is a cable car.",
          "It was a fantastic day in this amazing fortress. You can use cable car, clumping rocks to top of fortress, amazing landscape. Wear light sports clothes and after it enjoy Tbilisi garden",
          "We took cable car to the fortress with very cheap ticket fee. This historical place is very great and impressive. we have climb on the walls with very exciting on its height. Worth it to come here.",
          "Narikala Fortress is a crumbling section of wall on the skyline looking down onto old Tbilisi and over into the Botanical Garden. Get up close to gge large silver statue that dominates skyline. Direct access via cable car but be prepared for over 40 min wait in queue.",
          "An impressive location. The remaining structures are loose and unprotected so thread carefully. Best to have good footwear here as walls are unguarded and those with vertigo should strongly avoid. The view over the city is panoramic and worth the effort. We walked up via the",

          "You can reach the fortress by cable car (its a short walk down the hill - take the steps to the side of the cable car station and then walk along the path - if you see people trying to climb over the wall, ignore them! its a long drop down the other side and there is a proper",
          "Walked up to Narikala fortress (there is also a gondola for those who prefer not to walk) and got a beautiful view of the city.",
          "The fortress is definitely pretty cool. First off, it\u2019s free. It\u2019s an impressive structure that you\u2019re able to walk and climb around, and it offers incredible views. In other countries, you would never be allowed to climb on the fortress or go to the areas that have fallen apart",
          "You would feel amazed the fortress, after so many years, is still there and accessible. The chapel inside is still in use and allows you to observe if you could respect the rules.",
          "Nice location with views over the city on one site and the botanical gardens and mountains on the other. You can spend an hour discovering all the places around the fortress and the surrouding rocky hills. There is no entrance fee, except if you use the cable car. Walking up is",

          "You see this fortress and the \"Kartis Deda\" statue (aluminum statue of a woman) from anywhere in the Old Town of Tbilisi. From the top there are grand views over the city to the north and to the countryside and botanical garden to the south. Taking the cable car up and walking",
          "Bring good shoes, and explore. You can walk around the entire fortress up to the highest point of town. The views will take your breath away. And take some time, bring your camera. We walked up from our hotel, the botanical garden right around the corner is also worth a look.",
          "Splendid views over the city with the sulphur baths on one side and the botanical gardens on the other. The Fortress were destroyed many years ago but the little church was rebuilt later",
          "The view from above is captivating. My only complain is its tiring \ud83d\ude02 and just be extra careful because climbing can be a lil scary. Might be better not to bring kids to be honest because its not kid friendly. You can but only where the church is....my husband just keeps pushing",

          "Good to take the cable up from the river then take a leisurely walk down the hill. Also a great place at night with a spectacular view of the city. If you accidently buy a two way cable car ticket and only use on way, you can still use it on the metro.",
          "Visited with my kids 6 and 9. The fortress is simple and small. It\u2019s near the mother of Georgia attraction and we did it one the way down. You can visit this place in case you are planning to do mother of Georgia.",

          "We walked up to the fortress, which was a pretty steep climb, but lots of pretty buildings to see along the way. You can get the cable car up to near the fortress but it is not disabled friendly. Exploring the the fortress basically requires you to be climbing all over it so",
          "When you are in Tbilisi Georgia, it is a must that you visit the Narikala Fortress. Going here is worth it since there are a lot of tourist attractions you'll see while going here. Since you will be taking the cable car from Rike Park, then you'd be able to see the famous",

          "I walked up from the old city to the fortress, and was very much the only one on the steep streets leading to the fortress which actually is all ruins. When reaching the lower level where the church is located one gets already a good view of Tbilisi. But of course the peak was",

          "A ruined fortress perched up on a steep hill above the old town. Accessible on foot or by a cable car. Apart from the great views of the city, there is not a lot of see - the fortress is a dilapidated ruin, where one wrong step on a loose brick and you are slide down the hill.",
          "Worth a short visit and an explore, if only for the views. There are no information boards and it is difficult to explore, especially with young children. Steep hill to reach the castle. The path between the Castle and the Cable Car has many steps on it, not impossible to manage",
          "Hiked up the hill to Narikala Fortress, well worth the trek to see the old fortress walls especially the fabulous views over Tbilisi town.",
          "The fortress offers the most amazing views in all of Tbilisi, behind the fortress is the botanical gardens which was a bit of a let down, but at the fortress you have local stalls, amazing views and easy to get to using the Ariel cable car.",

          "The roads and paths leading up to the fort can be quite slippery and steep. Take care when choosing a path as some can get very dangerous. We walked up in a light rain in walking shoes and had to be careful on the steep/muddy spots. The view is worth the trip. Not much in",
          "It is quite a walk downhill if you go by the cable car. and a quite a walk uphill when you reach the entrance of the fort. The place is so peaceful that you could sit there for hours.",
          "Visited Narikala Fortress during sunset and it was spectacular and overwhelming. I had fun climbing up and down the ruins.",
          "The fortress needs some TLC, but is worth the climb. Yes, hike up the hill instead of taking the funicular. Get some exercise and enjoy the walk.",
          "I would highly recommend that you take aerial cable to the top of the fortress just before the sunset. With the sunset sunlight the air is almost palpable and you feel totally present. Get ready to stand and watch the colors change... that is if you don\u2019t care about the fortress",
          "amazing view from the city even day and night with a surprise at night to see the changing color of the river you can walk there or take a taxi or the cabin up to you wear good shoes visit is free",

          "The Fortress is more of the wall with ruins but it offers great views of the city on oneside and the botanical gardens on the other.",
          "Whether you walk up here or take the cable car (definitely take a cable car in the summer), it's worth a quick trip up. Nothing mind-blowing, but certainly not a waste of time either.",
          "Almost all of the fortress has dissapeared and nothing has remained than a couple of walls. Inside there is nothing to see but a high overview on the botanical gardens below.",

          "The Narikala fortress can be visited by road or cable car. The view of the fortress at night from the city looks better than what you see during the day.",
          "Astonishing view on Baku by night. We reached the fortress by feet. It is not very hard, 15 minutes walk. We went in evening when it was dark and the temperature was mild. We could appreciate a wonderful view of the city.",
          "After the tram ride, you can start a very nice walk on top of this fortress all the way down to the fort. Very recommended",
          "We walked up from median Square to the fortress, this is a nice steep walk and thereafter the fortress is a great way to view the city. The church is nice, be aware that you have to be dressed modestly. We liked the fortress a lot because it is not having all kinds of safety",
          "You need to put the right shoes because you will walk to much it very nice view and a lot of sightseeing around",
          "We hoped to see more, but it was still nice and worth. Fortress offers a colder shelter when the sun is high",

          "Great place to visit with the best views of the city. Take time to visit the gardens as they are wonderful",
          "There is not in special in this fortress, also its unsafe walk around once there is no safe bars or rails to protect fall down into the cliff. I saw a lot of people climbing dangers places for a pic only. The only good thing is the view of Tbilisi.",
          "Cross the river and catch a gondola ride up to Narikala Fortress looking down on Old Town. The ride is a speedy 1 minute and 42 secs (as advertised on the sign) and affords a great view of the city as you speed above. At the top take a right to head to the Kartlis Deda (Mother",
          "If you are looking for a nightime stroll in the Old part of Tbilisi, this is a very good destination. Not far from the popular hotels, and in between several landmarks. Hard to miss",
          "If you go up by the cable car (2.5 GEL) each way, then there is very little to walk to the fortress. Once you get on top, you can see incredible views of the city. On the other side you can see the botanical garden. Inside there is also a small church too. There are refreshment",

          "I have very few words to describe this palce. It is definitely must seen places in Tbilisi. You will observe all the old city from the top. Amazing historical place. A little bit hard to climb the steps, but to the certain place you can drive by car. You wouldn't regret the time",
          "If you went with the cable road then it's still a little walk. You walk down again and think that you are going down hill to the city again but the entrance will appear soon. The walls of the Citadel are renovated and inside the walls there is a little church.",
          "soso he is the best tour guide ever .. accommodated to every need of his customers.. planned the trip really well. Had the best time in Georgia .. if ur looking for tour guides my suggestion is look for Mr Soso..Made extremely good friends on this trip ..",
          "Although the fortress itself isn't the most amazing, it is free to visit, and the views from up there was fantastic. There's a nice little bar that overlooks the old town and was a great place to spend some time. The cable car up was fine, be warned if you have any mobility",
          "Take the cable car to go up and enjoy the view but you can go down walking to catch a different point of view and walk through the narrow old streets at the base. At the top after the cable car, go left to enter the fortress after walking a lit bit and right to Mamma Georgia",
          "This fortress actually is left out with ruins now. You can either climb up the hill which is not much tough task. Or else you can take a cable car ride which would cost you 5 GEL per person. The view from the cable car is not breathtaking. But it is still good with the ride not",

          "A steep, but short walk up the hill to the fort. Can walk around the defence wall, taking panoramic snapshots of Tbilisi. Full of tourists (like myself).",
          "Unsurprisingly, what was once a fortress became the garrison walls of a monastic complex. Best views are from climbing the outer walls, after which you\u2019re served with the grandness of the gorge that cuts through some of Tbilisi\u2019s more affluent neighbourhoods.",
          "A nice place to spend an afternoon climbing around the ruins, exploring the church, and enjoying the fabulous views of Tbilisi. Our teenage son had fun exploring. The fortress could use some contextual signs, but it costs nothing to enter, so what's to complain about? This",

          "We went up to the fortress twice: First time we took the cable car, second time we walked. I can highly recommend the latter (starting from Abanotubani, the baths\u2019 district) as you then end up right at the main parts of the old fortress where you can climb different parts of the",
          "Steeping out from the ropeway and walk around the fortress is one of the best thing to do in Tbilisi. You will be amaze on the view on top seeing the whole Tbilisi and you won't stop taking photos and you want to just follow the trail and explore the whole fortress. There is a",
          "Me and my husband visited the fortress. The cable car up to the fortress was smooth and nice. The view over the city was fantastic. We walked about on the top of the hill and saw the Fortress. It was very hot that day, so it was nice to buy cold drinks and relax in the shadow",
          "The walk from the very bottom to very top takes roughly 30-45 mins. Be sure to wear proper footwear as paths in the fortress are very rough. The fortress itself is fairly broken down however you can easily imagine how grand it would have been in its day. It\u2019s a good way to spend",
          "I spent a good part of my first day in Tbilisi at Narikala. The fortress is accessible by cable car, which starts running at 10:00AM. Once you get off, you can hike around the fortress, along the narrow walls and climb to the high points. These were the best views of Tbilisi I",
          "We walked up and it is not too bad (certainly easy compared to other walks in Georgia). The views are great, but you need to be careful if you want to explore the fortress, as there are some areas to scramble up, that may not be the safest, but they are also not fenced off.",
          "Narikala Fortress is one of the must visit places in Tbilisi. There are only ruins that are remaining from the old Fortress, but the excellent location gives great views of the Mtkvari river and Tbilisi city on the banks of the river. There are three ways to get to the fortress.",
          "There isn\u2019t much left of the fortress but it\u2019s definitely worth making the effort of climbing to the top for the amazing views over the city. And walking through the old Jewish quarter is also really interesting for the architecture so the steep walk doesn\u2019t feel that hard as",
          "To be honest, didn\u2019t go into historical meaning of the place but you simply cannot miss it: the ruins of the fortress overseeing the city and you can get nice views and shots from there. Besides it\u2019s a nice hike through the fortress and rocks up to the top. Bear in mind the",
          "The Fortress looms over the city and is an essential trip for anyone visiting Tbilisi. Easily accessible from the Old Town by foot (albeit with a steep climb), this can also be accessed cheaply and quickly via cable car, which is a nice addition. The views from the top are",
          "My favourite place in Tblisi. Went there several times both daytime and in the evening. Interesting ruins and a church, but best are the view especilly at night with all monuments lit up Only GEL 1 by cablecar with the Metromoneycard. Once up there you can take the zipline down",

          "The fortress itself hasn\u2019t got anything left inside. There is a church there at the entrance. I took the cable car from rike park, walked to the mother of all Georgians then walked towards the fortress side. You have to take stairs down as if you are going back down to the city",
          "One of my favourite spots in Tbilisi, since you can easily observe the whole city. I think I can easily sit somewhere on a bench with a view of the whole city and spend there the whole day. Nice cafes nearby as well. Prices a bit high on the top, but high prices in Georgia are",
          "To visit Narikala and the statue you have to use tele car (teleferic). It's a short by intresting experience. On top of the hill, there is a great view of Tbilisi and its landmarks. Specially at night it is very beautiful.",

          "We took the cable car up to the Narikala Fortress. While there is a beautiful night view, I recommend a visit during the daytime as there are some small footpaths to explore. Given it is unmarked and there are no railings for protection, it would be much safer to go when you can",

        "wiki": "Mtatsminda Park is a famous landscaped park located at the top of Mount Mtatsminda overlooking the Georgian capital Tbilisi. The park has carousels, water slides, a roller-coaster, funicular, and a big Ferris Wheel at the edge of the mountain, offering a splendid view over the city.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe park is situated at the 770 metres height, the highest point of Tbilisi, on the area of more than 100 hectares. It is connected to a motorway (Tbilisi-Okrokana Direction) as well as a funicular, built in 1905.\n\nTbilisi Funicular is a ropeway railway connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park. The length of the funicular road is 501 m, the angle of the tunnel is 28-33\u00b0, and the distance between the stations is 0,98 m. The upper station is at 727 m above sea level and the lower station is at 460 m above sea level.Giant Wheel is the highest attraction in Mtatsminda Park: it is 65 m high. The Giant Wheel completes one revolution in 10\u201312 minutes.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park was founded by the Soviet government in the 1930s and was once noted as the 3rd most visited public park in the USSR.\n[In 2001] the late Georgian billionaire Badri Patarkatsishvili along with his wife, Inna Gudavadze, began transforming the park into a 21st-century theme park. Badri owned the park as a charitable project alongside a number of commercial assets in Georgia, included the Rustavi Steel Plant, Borjomi water, and Imedi TV station.\nIn 2007 Patarkatsishvili became a vocal opponent of the National Movement Party and as a result, fell out of favor with President Mikhail Saakashvili. On the 7 November 2007, his assets including Mtatsminda Park and the Imedi TV station were seized by the Government under claims that the company had \u201cviolated numerous times\u201d the terms of the contract and had failed to pay a rental fee. Representatives of Patarkatsishvili immediately rejected this claims, saying that they were \u201cbaseless.\u201dAfter Patarkatsishvili's death at his home in England in February 2008, his widow Inna Gudavadze began international arbitration proceedings against the Government of Georgia, claiming that Mtatsminda Park, along with other Georgian assets, had been unfairly expropriated by the government. On the 29 October 2008, Inna Gudavadze said at a press conference in Tbilisi that Mtatsminda Park, as well as the Imedi TV station were \u201cBadri\u2019s personal projects for Georgia and the Georgian people\" and that she had a \"duty to see that these works are carried on.\u201dIn July 2011, the Patarkatsishvili family reached a settlement with the government that saw Mtatsminda Park returned to Inna and the family in return for them renouncing all claims to the ownership of Imedi TV. Following the fall of President Mikhail Saakashvili, Imedi was also subsequently returned to Inna and her family in October 2012 under the new government.In July 2014, the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Georgia issued a criminal indictment to former President Mikhail Saakashvili and a group of state officials for their role in the illegal expropriation of the Georgian assets owned by the Patarkasishvili family.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMtatsminda Pantheon\nTbilisi National Park\n\n\n== References ==",

During the Soviet era, the square was renamed twice:, first to \"Beria Square\", and then \"Lenin Square\". The location was first named Freedom Square in 1918, during the foundation of the First Georgian Republic following the collapse of the Russian Empire.\nFreedom Square was the site of the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery. Freedom Square has also been the site of various mass demonstrations including those for Georgia's independence (from the Soviet Union), the Rose Revolution, and others.  In 2005 Freedom Square was the location where U.S. President George W. Bush and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili addressed a crowd of around 100,000 people in celebration of the 60th anniversary marking the end of World War II.  During this event, Georgian-Armenian Vladimir Arutyunian threw a live grenade at President Bush while he was speaking in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate him.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\nAbutting the north side of Freedom Square is a small open space with a fountain and a bust of Alexander Pushkin. Nearby the famous communist Kamo (Simon Ter-Petrossian) was once buried, but during Stalin's rule his remains were moved to an undisclosed location.Tbilisi City Hall is situated on the Square. Other buildings include the former Bank of Georgia head office and the Marriott International Tbilisi. The square will also accommodate the Old Tbilisi local government office, the building works of which are already started.\nDuring the Soviet period, the square featured a large statue of Vladimir Lenin, which was symbolically torn down in August 1991. On November 23, 2006, the Liberty Monument depicting St George slaying the dragon, created by Zurab Tsereteli was unveiled in the same place.\n\nBranching out from this square are six streets: Rustaveli Avenue, Pushkin Street, Kote Apkhazi Street, Shalva Dadiani Street, Galaktion Tabidze Street and Giorgi Leonidze Street.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

Constructed between 1995 and 2004, it is the third-tallest Eastern Orthodox cathedral in the world and one of the largest religious buildings in the world by total area. Sameba is a synthesis of traditional styles dominating the Georgian church architecture at various stages in history and has some Byzantine undertones.\n\n\n== History and construction ==\n\nThe idea to build a new cathedral to commemorate 1,500 years of autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church and 2,000 years from the birth of Jesus emerged as early as 1989, a crucial year for the national awakening of the then-Soviet republic of Georgia. In May 1989, the Georgian Orthodox Patriarchate and the authorities of Tbilisi announced an international contest for the \"Holy Trinity Cathedral\" project. No winner was chosen at the first round of the contest when more than a hundred projects were submitted. Finally the design by architect Archil Mindiashvili won. The subsequent turbulent years of civil unrest in Georgia deferred this grandiose plan for six years, and it was not until 23 November 1995, that the foundation of the new cathedral was laid.The construction of the church was proclaimed as a \"symbol of the Georgian national and spiritual revival\" and was sponsored mostly by anonymous donations from several businessmen and common citizens. On 23 November 2004, on St. George's Day, the cathedral was consecrated by Catholicos Patriarch of Georgia Ilia II and high-ranking representatives of fellow Orthodox Churches of the world. The ceremony was also attended by leaders of other religious and confessional communities in Georgia as well as by political leaders.At least part of the site chosen for the new cathedral complex included land within what had once been an old Armenian cemetery called Khojavank. The cemetery once had an Armenian church destroyed during the Soviet period by the orders of Lavrenti Beria. Most of the cemetery's gravestones and monuments were also destroyed and the cemetery turned into a recreational park. However, the cemetery still contained many of its graves when construction of the Sameba Cathedral commenced. The cemetery was treated with a \"scandalous lack of respect\" according to one author, after bones and gravestones appeared scattered all over the construction site.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Sameba Cathedral is erected on the Elia Hill, which rises above the left bank of the Kura River (Mtkvari) in the historic neighborhood of Avlabari in Old Tbilisi.\nDesigned in a traditional Georgian style but with a greater vertical emphasis, and \"regarded as an eyesore by many people, it is equally venerated by as many others\". The Cathedral has a cruciform plan with a dome over a crossing resting on eight columns. At the same time, the parameters of the dome is independent from the apses, imparting a more monumental look to the dome and the church in general. The dome is surmounted by a 7.5 meter tall gilded gold cross.\n\nThe cathedral consists of nine chapels (chapels of the Archangels, John the Baptist, Saint Nino, Saint George, Saint Nicholas, the Twelve Apostles, and All Saints); five of them are situated in a large, underground compartment. The overall area of the cathedral, including its large narthex, is 3,000 square meters and the volume it occupies is 137,000 cubic meters. The interior of the church (nave) measures 56 metres by 44 metres, with an interior area of 2,380 square metres. The height of the cathedral from the ground to the top of the cross is 87.1 metres (height of stairs 1 metre). The underground chapel occupies 35,550 cubic metres and the height is 13.1 metres.Natural materials are used for construction. The floor is made of marble tiles and the altar will also be decorated with mosaic. The painting of the murals is being executed by a group of artists guided by Amiran Goglidze.\nThe Sameba complex, the construction of which is already completed, consists of the main cathedral church, a free-standing bell-tower, the residence of the Patriarch, a monastery, a clerical seminary and theological academy, several workshops, places for rest, etc.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTbilisi Sioni Cathedral\nList of tallest churches\nList of large Orthodox cathedrals\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

Since its opening in 2010 the structure has become an important pedestrian crossing in the city, as well as a significant tourist attraction and one of the most well-recognized landmarks of the capital.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe bridge which stretches 150 metres (490 ft) over the Kura River was ordered by the City Hall of Tbilisi to create a contemporary design feature connecting Old Tbilisi with the new district. The official opening took place on May 6, 2010. The bridge stretches over Kura River providing a view of the Metekhi Church, statue of the city's founder Vakhtang Gorgasali, and the Narikala Fortress on one side, and Baratashvili Bridge and Presidential Office on the other.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe bridge was designed by the Italian architect Michele De Lucchi, who had also designed the buildings of the Presidential Administration of Georgia and Ministry of Internal Affairs in Tbilisi; the lighting design was created by the French lighting designer Philippe Martinaud. The structure of the bridge was built in Italy and transported to Tbilisi in 200 trucks while the lighting was installed on site during the assembly of the structures.The bridge, a design of which reminds of a marine animal, has a curvy steel and glass canopy top which shimmers with an interactive light display at night, generated by thousands of white LEDs. The roof is fitted with 1,208 custom LED fixtures. The handrail glass panels which run along the whole length of the walkway are equipped with embedded linear low-power LED arrays.The lighting which is live from 90 minutes before sunset until 90 minutes after sunrise, features four different lighting programs that run on the canopy every hour. At times, the bridge lights up in waves from one side of the river to the other. At other times, the pattern begins with a band of light at either end, continuing from either direction until the light meets in the middle, and fading to black before starting over. The third program starts by lighting the outer fixtures on the roofline, then briefly illuminates the entire canopy before going entirely dark. The fourth program makes the roof twinkle like stars as different groups of fixtures light and dim across the entire bridge length.Within the bridge walkway, the low-power linear LED arrays embedded in the glass railings are triggered by 240 motion sensors as the pedestrians pass, giving an impression that the bridge lights come on for each person setting foot on the bridge. Additionally, a message in Morse code that renders the periodic table of elements goes across two parapets every hour. The lights designer Martinaud considers this communication celebration of \"life and peace between people\".\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe construction of a new steel and glass bridge in the historical district of Tbilisi was controversial. Several opposition politicians, architects, and urban planners unleashed criticism, complaining that the bridge unduly dominated the historical old town and obscured the area's old architectural landmarks.The bridge has been nicknamed the \"Always Ultra\" bridge for its perceived resemblance to a ladies' maxi-pad.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Georgia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Peace Bridge, Tbilisi at Wikimedia Commons",

          "This is an architecturally interesting bridge to walk on, that passes over the main river that runs through Tbilisi. It takes you to one end of Rikhe Park. The bridge would have far more impressive if the walkway were constructed of see-through glass, a la Calatrava.",

          "We had seen the bridge from a distance, but it was when we actually walked on it that we could appreciate its structure. The glass walls have tiny lights embedded in them, and when they are lit up at night, the bridge looks so very pretty - up close and from a distance.",
          "This is a great piece of modern architecture and forms a nice pedestrianised way over the river. There are good views from the bridge of the river and other bridges. The big nuisance factor was the number of children and young people coming up to us to try and sell boat trips.",
          "Very beautiful bridge and a well known place in Tbilisi. Loved by both Georgian and foreigners. You should go there at night and enjoy the Rike park.",

        "wiki": "The Metekhi Virgin Mary Assumption Church (Georgian: \u10db\u10d4\u10e2\u10d4\u10ee\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e6\u10d5\u10d7\u10d8\u10e1\u10db\u10e8\u10dd\u10d1\u10da\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e8\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e2\u10d0\u10eb\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8, romanized: met'ekhis ghvtismshoblis shobis t'adzari)  or Metekhi Church is a Georgian Orthodox church located on the left bank of the Mtkvari (Kura) river, on Metekhi Cliff, in Avlabari neighbourhood, opposite the old town of Tbilisi. Time of the church construction is still arguable and varies between the 5th, 6th, 11-12th or 13th centuries.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nFollowing a tradition in Georgian architecture of harmonious relationship of temples with the surrounding natural landscape, Metekhi Church was built to look like a growing continuation of the cliff, visible from many city points. The cross-in-square church occupies an area of 20 \u00d7 16 meters and is somewhat prolonged vertically. Eastern facade has three convex apsids, with central apsid the largest. Nothing similar is known among the churches of 11-13th centuries, which makes it rather archaic. The dome with tholobate is internally held by four pillars, which is also a more archaic feature (two pillars after 11th century), as well as semicircular projections on pillars. They were renovated in 16-17th centuries. Pointed arches under the dome are also the signs of 16-17th century rebuildings. The tholobate is wall destroyed by lightning in 17th century and restored in 18th. The church has a portal on the northern side, with stairs and entrance from the east. Presumably, the portal also had a western entrance, which is no longer in existence. Position of the portal in the central part of the wall, rather than in the western, is also not typical for the 11th-12th century architecture. .\n\nThe walls are made of hewn quadras, not preserved on the southern facade, where they were substituted by bricks in 18th century. Original walls remain on the east and north sides, lower part of the west and eastern part of south side. The entrance on the southern wall was also created in 18th century.\nExterior decorations of the church, traditional Georgian rock carvings, are characteristic for the Georgian Golden Age of 11th-12th centuries. The most well-preserved eastern facade with three apsids, and northern facade with the portal contain decorative rock engravings. Rhombic rosettes and convex architraves are the motives commonly used in church decorations of that period. However, also characteristic architecture is missing except for portal passages. Architrave of the central apsid has ornamented cross. Decorations are generally disconnected, rather schematic and miniaturised, which are the characteristics of 13th century style.\nInterior murals were not preserved. Among various icons one, called \"100000 martyrs\", tells about a tragic event that took place in Tbilisi in 1226. The town was taken over by troops of Kwarazm-shah, Jalal ad-Din. He ordered that icons from Sioni church were dropped on Metekhi Bridge, and Tbilisi citizens to step on them or beheaded. Church tradition tells about 100,000 inhabitants, who disobeyed and were executed. Their heads were floating downstream of Mtkvari River.\n\n\n== History ==\nOral tradition attributes construction of the church to the King Vakhtang I Gorgasali in the 5th century, who erected it as his court church, or to his son Dachi in the 6th century, although neither archeological nor written evidence exist about this. Same tradition places the tomb of St. Shushanik into the church sacristy. But no studies confirmed that yet. Some 19th century authors even mention exact year, 455, when the church was founded by Vakhtang I.The name \"Metekhi\" was first time mentioned in the Georgian medieval chronicles Kartlis Tskhovreba in connection with suppression of the rebellion against King Demetre I in 1132 (or 1145), and execution of eristavi Ivane Abuletisdze, who was buried in \"Metekhi\". It is though unclear, which particular church is mentioned. Except for Tbilisi, a church of Assumption is also found in a small village named Metekhi.\nThe second mention is concerned with The Battle of Shamkor in 1195 (or 1200), when King Tamar, after sending troops, \"...took off her shoes and arrived barefeet to the Church of Assumption in Metekhi\". By the fact that royal palace was in Tbilisi, it is often supposed that Metekhi Church was already there in the end of 12th century. Meanwhile, other facts from Kartlis Tskhovreba further confuse the situation. The troops before leaving for the battle were gathered in \"Somkhiti\", that is Lower Kartli region, and Tamar was present there. After sending the troops she walked to the church back in Tbilisi, which would be impossible to do barefeet. Further, it is said that she \"went to the Church of Assumption in Vardzia and prayed before the Virgin Mary of Vardzia... and sent troops from Vardzia, standing there herself barefeet...\".\nIf Metekhi Church was there, it was destroyed in 1235 during the invasion of the Mongols, and rebuilt some time between 1278 and 1289, under the reign of Demetrius II. The third mention in The Georgian Chronicles tells that \"The king... built a monastery in Isani Palace for the Virgin Mary of Metekhi.\" Isani was the original name of a neighbourhood on left bank of Mtkvari River on high cliff that hosted royal palace, and thus this is the earliest clear mention of presence of monastery in Tbilisi on Metekhi Cliff. At least until the end of 14th century the area surrounding the monastery was still covered by forests, which is concluded from 1398 charter of Metekhi church: \"... A monastery of the Virgin Mary Metekhi in Avlabar, with its manor and Avlabar forests belonging to it.\"\nDuring the reign of Vakhtang V, in 1658, the church became a storage for gunpowder. The monastery was abandoned in the same century. Its first depiction also comes from the same time by French traveller Jean Chardin (1671).\n\nThe fortress together with the church were retaken from Turks by Erekle II in 1748. Carving on southern facade tells about this event: \"The King Erekle II forcely took this fortress from enemy, lead by the Christ's Cross like a shield. Having the church freed, he turned it into his court church. Such are the deeds of Christ loving king. In glory of the God and to the King Erekle.\"\nAfter Georgia was included into the Russian Empire, the fortress became a prison, and prisoners scratched their names on the church facade.\nIn the beginning of Soviet era, in 1921, NKVD camp was on the place. Executions of prisoners were regularly committed here. Fortifications were destroyed in 1937, and the church was also planned to be demolished, but managed to survive due to local protest. In 1940-60s, the church functioned as a depository for collections of the National Museum of Art, and entire eastern part of the interior was separated by thick wall. In 1974, the wall was demolished and the church was made a youth theater. It had a backstage in southern part of interior, a stage under the dome, surrounded by amphitheater with 100 seats. Finally, the church was returned to worship in 1988.\nFirst comprehensive measurements and quality drawings and photographs of the church were made by a group of scientists, lead by Vakhtang Beridze in 1942 and subsequent years. The results, including description of church history and analysis, were compiled in a monograph by Beridze et al. (1969).\n\n\n== References ==",

          "It\u2019s contained many sections and 4 floors you will stay there at least 2 hours it\u2019s very nice to know about the history of Georgia",
          "Georgia is a special place in many ways. This museum visit left much to be hoped for. I would have liked to see something on Cyrus the Great and his legacy. Why is his name all over Tbilisi while there's not a single mention in the museum? The Georgian language is a unique",
          "A quiet pleasant stroll viewing paintings, sculptures and relics from the past. The caretakers/security personnel weren't especially alert, many busy studying their phones.",
          "This is a very well laid out Museum, with 7Gel admission for adults and 0.5 Gel for schoolchildren. The StoneAge section has a fantastic display of skulls on the Ground Floor and up on the fifth floor is the Russian Occupation Floor. The stories told on the fifth floor are",
          "Cost GEL 14 as entrance fee. To be honest didn\u2019t think it was worth it. However on the 4th floor is where you find the \u201c occupation of Georgia \u201c. This was properly orchestrated. Brought tears to my eyes . Location was easy to find. There was no tour guard. Pictures not allowed",
          "Georgia has a far reaching history and at the national museum artefacts are on display. It really has monumental artefacts and can be considerd a must see when in Georgia",
          "Along Rustaveli Avenue and across from the former Parliament building where the Rose Revolution started is a well laid out museum of Georgian History old and new. Check out the basement floor for a beautiful collection of Georgian treasures - gold pieces from ancient times, and",
          "Good museum. Has 4 floors. Each floor has different things. It shows the history of georgians Shows their local habits and clothes. Shows their treasures. Shows some of the devices and weapons used during the Soviet Union period.",
          "Lots of material of Georgian history. Very interesting items. Very big area. You need to take rest couple of times. Overall very much recommended if you are interested in history.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this museum. The stone age exhibits were especially interesting. The English information was reasonable. The artefacts were well displayed and curated. I would recommend a visit if you are in tblisi with a couple of hours to",
          "I am not a museum person and I usually avoid going to one. This time however I had heard a lot about this museum so decided to go here. The entrance fee is very nominal. The building has four floors. The basement has the treasury, the ground floor has the archeological stuff,",
          "This small museum will teach you about Georgia's rich culture and history through various objects and fascinating pieces of information. Among the most interesting sections of the museum is the gold and silver jewelry department, which displays thousands of years of jewelry that",
          "The museum has a wide variety of exhibits. I was particularly interested in the history of Soviet occupation and rule in Georgia which was very good - even better if you can read Russian because many of the documents on display are in Russian. There are descriptions but no",
          "The museum is very well designed and has a number of special exhibits in addition to regular ones. It has good signage and most items have English descriptions in addition to Georgian, so it\u2019s easy to follow along. The most moving exhibit was about the Soviet occupation and the",
          "If you like history from Palaeolithic till Soviet Union time you must visit this museum.Georgian has long history and you can learn more about it by visiting this place.Entrance fee is only 7 lari ,multilingual guides are also available .good places to come with kids as well .",
          "This is a well maintained museum with many excellent exhibits. We enjoyed the exhibit of Paleolithic cultures and hadn\u2019t realized that very early hominids had been in Georgia more than 30,000 years ago. There is also a good exhibit on the tragedy of Russian/Soviet",
          "There\u2019s a somewhat confused summary of recent Georgian history in the entry foyer - pity there\u2019s no indication where you should start and finish. The highlight is the basement treasury which includes iconography of two centuries of Georgian religious practice. Also good is the",
          "We went to learn a little more about Georgia. The entrance price is 7 GEL for adults (about $3). Guides are also available if you want more information about the exhibits. The descriptions are in Georgian, English and Russian. There is an impressive exhibit of jewelry and",
          "It is by far one of the best museums I have ever visited. They have arranged various items (from very old times to the modern day) in 4 floors and it indeed is a mixture of different museums and has something for everyone. The museum work everyday from 9am to 5pm and the",
          "The most interesting items of the museum are the gold artefacts that dominate the bottom floor rooms. The items range from BC to medieval times and cover plaques, brooches, coins and other items. Well worth a visit for the gold items alone and makes you wonder how much gold",
          "This museum has a superb collection of god artifacts from pre-history onwards. The legend of the Golden Fleece which was sought by Jason and the Argonauts originates in Georgia and much of the gold in this museum comes from that period, My favourites a necklace made of Tiny",
          "for lovers of antiques, this museum offers superb works. Did not have much time to visit it, but the bottom floor is superb!",
          "It was raining so it was a way of keeping dry. That said it was worth the visit. There is lots to learn about Georgia and Georgian history.",
          "A very interesting visit! You can see objects from the pre historical, bronze ages! Beyond these objects there are many made of gold! Incredible work!",
          "Icons, Gold finds are well represented here. I found the exhibition relating the history of Soviet control of particular interest, and strongly recommend that you visit that",
          "There are no parking at the museum. We parked on the side street and paid the attendant. Learned a lot of Georgian history from ancient to modern in the museum.",
          "I'm just trying to add photos instead of writing a review, yet again, but yet again TA won't let me do that. The museum is easy to find from Liberty Square, though one will have to walk halfway to Rustaveli if one wants to cross the road at the museum, so if you are coming from",
          "Start on the top floor to get a history Georgia and Russia/Soviet Union. Sobering. The other floors contain numerous fascinating artifacts that you won't necessarily find elsewhere. We really enjoyed the visit and recommend a stop.",
          "The Georgian National Museum located on Rustaveli Avenue is an absolutely great place to spend a few hours. I always believe that one should learn about the history of a nation while on tour in a city or country. The museum has 4 floors so visitors usually start on the ground",
          "Giving the relatively limited number of visitors when we went, it did not seem that this museum is on the tourist map of Tbilisi.Well, it is a pity as this is a fantastic place. It is modern, not too small, not too large and the collection is very interresting. There are some",
          "Unbelievable heritage treasures and a real must see for everyone who loves ancient history and evolution.",
          "We spend there 2h. It is a really fast way to learn about Georgia. They even have a student discount \ud83d\ude09",
          "Super cool little spot, 4.5 floors of exhibition for 7 lari, which is definitely worth it. I really liked the exhibit on the struggle for independence and some of the preservation of old religious artwork in the basement. Close to Liberty Square metro stop on Shota Rustaveli, so",
          "Very good collection of archaeological artefacts from Georgia. Among them very beautiful and interesting pieces of works by early Georgian goldsmiths. I recommend to visit this place to everyone.",
          "This is an imporatnt destination if you want to learne about the country's early and modern history. Some of the artefacts are beautifully presented.",
          "Very interesting museum, has diverse information, must see skeletons throughout the ages - this section cannot be missed!",
          "One of the best museums that we saw in Georgia. The Georgian National Museum was modern and explained thing well. Not to miss is the Colchis Gold exhibit. Amazing!!",
          "It is a good place to visit the culture, the old house plan, the historical equipment including garment, cloths, musical ... A bar could be find gift shops are available good prices are presented",
          "Visiting Georgia and Tbilisi should include a visit to a museum, in order to get a better understanding of the rich culture long and history. Georgian National Museum on Shota Rustaveli is very central located and gives you the opportunity to explore different parts of the",
          "Museums always give you an insight of the countries history..this museum is on Rustavelli Avenue....entry is minimal but would suggest at least 2 hours to absorb a bit of it's civilisation history. There are various floors, with sections... ...the struggle for independence was",
          "It has a few different categories! Soviet occupation. Human evolution. Archelogical teasury. Religious museum. A bit unrelated but you can find old animal bones .",
          "Nice and big one with too many pictures I think it was 3-4 floors located in Opera street highly recommended for visit",
          "Unless you are very and I mean extremely interested in History this is going to be boring for you. The gold exhibition was described as exquisite where we walked through in five minutes. We were very keen on the Soviet invasion but unfortunately a lot is only in Georgian.",
          "There are so many surprises in the this museum it is hard to know where to begin, but the various gold hordes on display in the basement is worth the whole trip to Tblisi. These are not just of interest for their great age, they are physically beautiful and well-displayed.",
          "It is a large museum with a lot to see and honestly you will spend a lot of time there being amazed by the richness of their culture. The museum has a lot to offer and is very rich in its display Only negative is that the last floor has very bad air supply.",
          "I have visited several times and I'm amazed every time. there you will see everything about Georgia and its history",
          "The ground floor describes the history of Georgia with the most ancient items. There are English and Russian speaking guides to help you throughout the tour. Prices are very cheap compared to European countries. This is truly must see place.",
          "There is really nothing much to see here, but if you have nothing else to do and you feel like seeing some old artifacts this is something you can do to kill time at Tbilisi.The entrance if 5 GEL which I think is too much for what you get to see inside. Then again visit the WC\u2019s",
          "I only saw the gold exhibit which is truly astounding and a must see if you are in Tbilisi. Would like to go back to visit the rest of the museum. Well worth going to!",
          "It's a good place to pass some time and get away from the craziness outside that you may encounter/ have thrust upon you in Georgia.",
          "Couldnt enter the museum i dont know where the main door and noone in the reception has come and open the door! But probably it has free entrance.",
          "It's very nice. You will see and learn the life of georgian people before and they have free guide inside each house. There is also restaurant inside the area.",

          "We three British middle aged guys were on our last week in Georgia and decided to visit the museum on Friday 29/9. After a late lunch in Duqani we thought we were cutting it fine by trying to fit a museum in before (we thought) it closed at 18:00. We arrived at this museum to",
          "Artefacts date back to the third millenium BC. Of note are three specific sections: the costume section, the war section and the hominid section. The last is the most extensive I have come across, It charts the development of Homo Neanderthal and Homo Sapiens both in chart form,",
          "Full of beautifully presented and expertly curated pieces of wonder from Georgia. I was blown away by the pure beauty of 4000 year old golden ducks and the solemnity of the bullet holes in the train carriage.",
          "The lower floors of the museum are filled with interesting exhibits on archaeology, weapons, period dress, gold. BUT the most interesting exhibit for me was on Soviet Occupation. It was opened in 2006 to celebrate the anniversary declaration of independence from the Russian",
          "We visited there last week. Really interesting museum. Wonderful displays that are clearly labeled and easy to appreciate. We had a wonderful visit there as it is world class",
          "Easy to explore on your own and exhibits are spread out. On the day I went, there were not many other visitors.",
          "Located in a recently renovated Soviet era building, this museum has a extraordinary display of Paleolithic hominid remains and stone tools. The collection of ancient coins and gold objects is world class. There is a good display of 18th-19th century costumes and weaponry. The",
          "The Soviet Occupation part of the museum on the top floor is the highlight and the draw of the place, but I found the whole thing quite interesting. Definitely worth your time if you have a few days in Tbilisi.",
          "Hidden away near Freedom Square, this relatively small museum contains many items from the country's very mixed history. Items from cavemen to present day history. Much to learn in a quick afternoon. Would be helpful to have a short guided tour.",
          "We had a great visit but to see & understand what you see yo should get a guide. We did. she did not speak English, so my wife translated from Russian. What a fantastic & knowledgeable guide. Her name began with an 'M', and she was an older Georgian lady, so if you have a",
          "This is a modern well set out museum. In the basement is a display of the more glittery finds. There is also information about Georgia from the Bronze Age to the C20th.The section on the occupation is rather chilling. We came with a tour group but the visit was very rushed so we",
          "Considered a major attraction in tbllisi city, this was one of the sites I have visited for my very short visit of six hours. Can be done in an hour and thirty minutes, all four floors. Very interesting.",
          "The basement is full of all sorts of treasures - gold, silver, fabrics etc. Much of it is totally amazing. On the groundfloor an excellent exhibition of Georgian lower paleaolithic discoveries and casts of the skulls from all stages of human evolution. Upstairs very good",
          "One of the most interesting places to visit in the City. There are different exhibitions at the same time, so you will always find something that interests you. I would have preferred a little bit more information about the occupation exhibition.",
          "Stopped here for 45 minutes on our tour, went to the treasury and the religious section. Great storehouse of archeological knoweldge ancient jewellery and church adornments and beautiful religious section including costumes.",
          "Very 'cleanly' curated. By which I mean that there was a definite narrative in the way the museum was laid out and organised. For that I wished it would have been possible to shake Professor David Lordkipanidze's hand for directing the National Museums in such an intelligent",
          "Exhibits are well organised, very rich collection from the various periods of human civilization, as well as fossils discovered in the Soviet era and later",
          "We were interested in the soviet occupation period. Prices are quite cheap, so you can go in and out. It is not worth spending more than one out according to us.",
          "I feel like I know much more about Georgia and some of the artefacts were truly breathtaking. The shop was quite limited though, and the cafe non-existant.",
          "The museum is very close to the metro station and it's pretty big, so you can't miss it. We skipped the guided tours as they are a bit spicy, but the exhibits themselves are quite educational, especially as they all have English descriptions. The temporary exhibit on the origins",
          "This museum require a guide or at least a recorder to explain everything. It shows the history of Georgia and many stages it has gone through.",
          "Don't miss this museum. Masterpieces of Georgian golden age. Interesting the museum of Soviet Occupation at the last floor and interesting temporary exhibitions",
          "Beautiful structure but the content is not detailed as it could be about Georgia. In any case I found a temporary exhibition about early human discover in Europe and it was really interesting. There is also an area about the soviet era, in a wonderful big room, but the",
          "The museum has a very good dxhibition dedicated to human evolution, with a sprcial stand for Dmanisi fossils. Clearly explained and well-presented. We also liked the permanent exhibition covering Soviet occupation of Georgia. A must-see for anyone interested in the history of",
          "Loads to see and soak up here; more focus on pre-historic and classical history than the mediaeval and modern periods.",
          "By visiting this place you can go through the lifestyle of georgian people, the foods, dance, folk music, costume and etc...",
          "Museum is modern and heavily staffed situated along the main drag. There are extensive archaeological and geology sections as well as modern exhibitions. I was most interested in the displays regarding the Russian Occupation following the invasion of 1920-21.This was a sequel to",
          "We visited in August.There was an exhibit on Stone Age Georgia that had traveled allover the Western hemisphere. It was simply EXCELLENT. Their archaeology exhibit was superb. Wonderfully curated. Soviet Occupation was another good one although the room was unbearably hot.",
          "No photography at all allowed inside the museum. Bottom floor is bones and skulls, things of that nature. Top floor is jewelry and other figurines.",
          "I loved seeing the beautiful gold jewellery and other things here. A lot of care has been put into the way they have been displayed.",
          "What do you think you can find to the national museum? As usual - the good exposition about the full time of history that country, especially for so ancient country. But forget about that here - the ruined all, just for provide the \"soviet occupation exposition\". Did they",
          "I think the most interesting part is the treasury. You need a guided tour for that which costs 51 lari and is in the ground floor.. the 1st floor is accessible by a 3lari entrance ticket and has a lot of Ani Kent paintings and few artefacts from recent excavations",
          "Spent a few hours at the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi last week getting some culture and seeing what is on display here. Like a lot of national museums it is fully loaded with lots of great artifacts and displays showcasing the history of the area, the country and other",
          "This is a must see on your travels. truly wonderfully displayed adn multi levels of incredible history and gems ( literally) lots of ohhh and ahhhing... I must say tears came up in the soviet era room, it is deliberately dark to enhance the times endured. it works ..",
          "Certainly a must go place in Tbilisi.The gold collection as well as the anthropological one are unique and precious. It is not a big museum and it is very central. You will get a very good idea of ancient Georgians ability in gold and jewellry hand making.",
          "We went here on our last day of tour.Reason behind going was to see the history of Georgia as we had read and heard a lot about it from our tour guide.This museum impressed us beyond our expectation there were multiple section depicting various eras and all are wonderfully",
          "I visited this museum with my family. Our impressions are as follows: Pros - Museum is well built - location is great, at the heart of the city Cons - Unfriendly staff - Most writings are in Georgian language with no translation - Museum cafe begs for improvement - limited",
          "Impressive collection of gold jewellery from the first two millenia BC. Also displays nice finds from the Roman period as well as Georgian Christian art. Allow for at least two hours.",

          "Really nice museum covering Georgia from 2000 BC to recent times. Impressive exhibition of the rich finds through time. Well organized with well written descriptions in Georgian and English. I did not expect a museum at this level. Even the kids (5 and 10 years) liked it a bit.",
          "Bad idea to visit with two toddlers but the exhibitions we did visit were outstanding. English, Russian (I believe) and Georgian for most displays. Quiet atmosphere. Traditional museum rules: no food, no drinks, no flashes on cameras.",

          "Whether you know much about Georgia or not, this is an interesting museum. It is well-presented, with a wide sweep of exhibits, mostly in English. Some are not, but are well-contextualized, so you can follow along.",
          "Most of the bigger stuff is labeled in English, but a lot isn't. Great collection of coins and some of the prehistoric and early Colchis stuff is pretty interesting. Really liked the \"Soviet Occupation\" floor. Somber and ruthless telling about the oppression.",
          "It has some good stuff, but the exhibits are strangely organised, and the information can seem less than adequate. However, I did see the wheels of the chariot burial( very important prehistorically) and some of the gold items are amazing. Also the section about Georgia under",

          "We found the museum to be very interesting. It clearly presents items with good explanations in English. We particularly found the sections on prehistoric people in this region, jewelry from 2000-3000 BC, and the terrible events of the Soviet period to be most informative.",
          "The current exhibition Stone Age Georgia (on until September 2017) is a must see for anyone interested in our prehistoric past - out of Africa into the Caucasus. The explanatory signage is superb, and the Dmanisi skulls are a stunning revelation.",

          "A nice collection but could have been better if it was little more friendly to Foreigners. I could understand about this when I asked about it to my local friends...Not everyone know History so well :-(",
          "An accessible museum with a great layout. The jewelry was really quite fascinating and I'm not usually interested in that type of display. The floor on Soviet Occupation was my favorite. It was very moving and necessarily provocative.",
          "My wife and I went to the exhibit of the Soviet Occupation from 1921-1991 and for those history or cold war buffs, this is fascinating. You see the history of the Soviet occupation, the counter insurgency from the locals and the human cost of the occupation, broken up by eras",
          "We only had couple hours to stop before I left for the airport. The guide Took us into a room filled with gold objects. I\u2019m surprised to see gold fabricated into jewelry that was done almost 4,000 years ago. My host describes Georgia as a place where east meets west and north",
          "The Soviet Occupation (second floor) is particularly interesting. The plaster casts of Dmanisi man are also wonderful, but I had hoped for a more academic exhibition.",
          "We liked the golden room downstairs full of ancient jewelry, as well as the Medieval Georgian hall upstairs. The Soviet hall is worth visiting, too. The only minus was that they asked us out 30 min. before the closing time, although we had only 1 more hall not visited.",
          "It's a small museum with a strange organization of departments but a very interesting one. The Soviet Occupation exposition is breathtaking and very interesting to understand the current situation of the country. The Treasury part is unique and worth the visit, you will see rare",
          "I liked the treasury in the basement a lot. It's like a walk through the history of goldsmithery. A bit disappointing were the only few artefacts from Dmanisi and the rather short documentation of the findings.",
          "I honestly think for the lay out and the different exhibits its better than some I have visited in the EU ,for someone who lives for history ,I found it superb ,it was so clean ,and the staff I found extremely polite and looked happy in the job",
          "I did like the sowjet occupation covered in the 4th Floor. This is a very sober ad clean take on the times from 1919 - 1991, highly informative. For example i was not aware of the soldarity in Georgia at the time of Hungarian Uprising in 1956. We liked the Treasury, it",
          "Good introduction to Georgia's history and the Soviet occupation. Loved the Treasury section and archaelogy sections. Perhaps the shop could have more variety of souvenirs.",
          "We paid about $10 or $15 or so for a private guide who was really, really great. She gave us a tour of the room downstairs with all the jewelry and artifacts which I don't think you can go to unless you have a guide. It was SOOOO worth it and I would even love to do again!",
          "Soviet Occupation Exhibition was the only one which I was interested in, so my experience is about it - great, modern style of presenting the history, but please, more! One room is definitely not enough for history lovers!",
          "This is a great museum, and definitely worth the visit. Staff is friendly and very helpful, and the gift shop a great place to pick up souvenirs. The collection of Persian paintings on the 4th floor was especially impressive.",
          "This review is just on the Soviet Occupation Exhibit, as it was late in the day and really did not have a chance to see other parts of the museum ( I had just come over from the icon museum across the square down the street). Because I don't know much about Georgian history,",
          "You can not help but be struck by the airy clean spaces in this museum, which is the backdrop for the archeology, history, culture, and the artifacts. Wonderful. Of course the gold and silver is a dazzling highpoint. And especially a lot of thought went into the Soviet",
          "I overall liked the museum, especially the older parts of it. I liked the varied and interesting displays, the collections are thoughtful and well put together. The museum has been reorganized recently, the third storey being devoted to the Russian occupation, the topic",
          "I went there with my boyfriend to see exhibition and AC was not working. We almost fainted. At registry they dont give you any information about museum or sections they have. Its very beutiful and interesting place, but needs more attention from Mayor!!!",
          "It is a nice Museum and offeres free entry for students :) You can see a lot of Georgian culture but also learnabout the Egyptian and Chinese culture.",
          "Fascinating museum, the Treasury show has incredible artefacts found during digs. The Occupation exhibition is beautifully put together.",
          "The Museum newly organised is not to be missed. In the main building on Rustaveli you can see (1) The Treasury containing artifacts from Georgia's distant past. The existence oif gold and silver accounts for the FANTASTIC assortment of jewellery from ancient Cholkis, fabulous",
          "Spent an hour walking through the Georgian National Museum - the displays of ancient gold artifacts from the archeological digs in Georgia are impressive and worth checking out. Also a good display of the Russian occupation of Georgia during Soviet times.",
          "Many museums make up the Kartveli/Georgian National Museum system. Visit them all and win a prize. Magaria!",
          "If you are serious about having a good understanding of Georgia, and thus paid for the guided tour, make sure you check at the reception what is included in the tour. The lady guide (with silver hair) we had terminated the guiding service after just going through the",
          "I could spend a long time in this place. The one piece of advice I have is spend some time listening to the guide before you hire them. I have been there twice and the first time the woman who was my guide had a passion for the subject and I learned quite a lot. The second time",
          "It is has lots of beautiful things and interesting history to tell, but I missed more information in English. I found the part which told about the Soviet period in Georgia on the top floor most interesting.",
          "very rich jewelry selection and a very nice Ghajar painting collection. it is an interesting place to go",
          "Breathtaking exhibition of ancient pieces of art. Georgia in the Soviet period is demonstrated in a special exhibition - moving experience.",
          "You will find here everything about Georgia beginning from stone age to nowadays. fantastic collection of golden art. I recommend this museum to get a best knowledge about Georgia",
          "Fascinating history of Georgia beautifully displayed. At present, there's an excellent, yet horrifying exhibition of the country under soviet occupation. There are excellent WC facilities here too if you're out on the town for the day.....",
          "Not a very large museum, 3-4 hours enough for visiting. The opportunity to feel a real spirit of Georgia, on one hand, history and cultural heritage, on the other hand, destructive influence of Russia and communism.",
          "This is a fascinating museum, full of great pieces of ancient pottery and metalwork - especially the gold pieces whose intricacy and inventiveness knocked me sideways. There were some fantastic bronze articles too: the rams' head pins with their spiralling horns made me want to",
          "The Collection in this Museum is first class. The collection from burial sites in Colchis was of particular interest - this is Jason and the Argonauts country, and it reminds one of the connection to the Greek world and in fact you get a very good idea of the styles that",
          "Besides the floors that house national treasures unearthed from the many archeological sites in Georgia, the upper floor is dedicated to documenting the horrors of the Soviet occupation. It is a must see, and I recommend to start at that floor first. After that, visit the lower",
          "From precious gems from the third millenium to date to oriental art, this single building has everything. This includes the tragic history between Georgia and Russia. Not to be missed.",
          "Amazing jewellery exhibition - items made 4000 years ago would not be out of place today and workmanship quite incredible. Also found visit to Soviet era exhibit very thought provoking. Most people would not think of Georgia as a holiday destination but it is a wonderful country",
          "Niko Pirosmani. 1 whole floor of his paintings. Good art shop on the first floor where you can buy books",
          "The museum focuses on treasures of Georgia and its occupation history. The Soviet occupation claimed and touched many lives in this corner of the world. It shows the price exacted for any disagreement with the powers that be. The treasury is a good collection of local",
          "A great place to stop and have a look at some history of Tbilisi and Georgia. Fantastic exhibition of jewellery in the basement from the last 4000 years. Some pieces in incredible condition. A must see.",
          "When I visited this museum there was an exhibition of Iranian paiting that was interesting for me. Apart from that I thing this museum has a lot to offer. it is located in Rustaveli and not far from the freedom square.",
          "The treasury of gold items is stunning, the display of the history of the Soviet Occupation on the top floor is not to be missed. This a nice, cosy museum, the scale is quite small; the displays are well set out and labeled in English. You only need about 90 minutes to do it",
          "like - treasury floor dislike - soviet occupation period floor the treasury floor is full with beautiful and cultural stuff",
          "This is not a huge national museum usually found in capital cities but rather a tiny place where you can wander and take as much time as you want. The Treasury section of the museum is of great interest as it host a huge collection of golden artefects from different centuries.",
          "very nice place to visit and learn history of this country. also there are many things to learn about the previous generations and their way of thinking",
          "A first visit to a Georgian Museum! We saw the ancient gold exposition and the Soviet Occupation area. Knowing the history of the Soviet time is important. This was a very direct and emotion filled display. Well maintained and some very good museum folks willing to explain",
          "This museum has wonderful displays of the history of Georgian armoury, staggering archaeological artefacts from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD and a sobering history of the Soviet occupation of Georgia, spread over three floors with good explanations also in English.",
          "Georgian National museum is must see in Tbilisi. There you can enjoy the various historical artifacts. the most exciting site is the gold collection of pre-christian period and the soviet occupation section as well. You will also love the small museum shop, where you can buy",
          "I took the day off to visit the museum but unfortunately the power went off and theys shut the museum. This is something to always plan in this country",
          "This is a small museum, but quite rich in exhibits. The permanent exhibition of the museum contains jewelry of pre-christian period (IV-VI cent BC). Some of the pieces are really exquisite, anybody would love to have those jewelry even now. The museum also has a section on",
          "A real taste of Caucasian pre Christian culture. Remarkable are the jewels and arms. To be seen the so called soviet invasion section",
          "This Museum showed the extent and depth of history in Georgia. Pieces dating back to 2nd and 3rd millenium B.C. The silk road provided the source of so many trinkets and monetary items. The treasury is a highlight with the intricate jewellery collection dating back thousands of",

          "excellent museum. And do not forget the part with the Russian occupation history. I learned a lot about the history of georgia that I did not realize. Be wise and take one of the very good guides. I had an older lady who knew all about bher country and was very motivated and",
          "This Museum in Rustaveli is very interesting and provides comprehensive information and perspectives of Georgian art, as well as a truly experience of Soviet Era. There is also an information centre for tourists downstairs.",

          "Unlike a lot of places in this part of the world, everything was marked in english. Beautiful gold exhibition and informative soviet occupation section. Weapons also interesting. Good use of EU funds to update the place.",
          "The museum's current exhibit is limited to the Treasury, the 4th floor exhibit of the Soviet occupation and a small collection of Persian and other Asian art. The artifacts in the Treasury date to the beginning of metal working in Georgia and are well worth the trip alone. The",

          "Many national museums are rather dull, oldish and traditional. This museum has an informative presentation of the soviet-communist occupation of Georgia. It also has a very interesting display of jewellery - many beautiful articles, some several thousand years old. Most articles",
          "The open spacious galleries with large pieces that show the important people (and are the important artwork) of Georgia fill the place. This is one place to be sure to see if you want to complete your visit with some perspective of the history that is Georgian culture.",

          "When we arrived in Tbilisi, we have been already travelling for a few months throughout the Black Sea region, and have learned quite a bit about the ancient history. I've learned over some time that if I have time, I should definitely get guided tours, especially when in the",
          "Is this museum a joke? If this is what they have to represent the country, I suppose Georgia has no history. When we entered, my spouse and I noticed that there was not anyone near the ticket selling desk. After debating who might be the person we needed to speak with, we asked",
          "A collection of beautiful, mainly gold, jewelry and artefacts (3 BC to 3 AD) found in burial sites in Georgia. Also some interesting rooms entitled \"The museum of the occupation\" [of Georgia by Russia]. A cafe and couple of shops selling books, postcards etc. Not a huge amount",
          "The part about Sovjet occupation was very good and nicely done. Other displays in the museum seem very random. A bit chinese and persian culture, some gold jewelry they found in georgia. It was ok, but to me less interesting. The museum is quite small and can be done in one",
          "I was a bit disappointed with the Georgian National Museum. The exhibitions they did have (precious metals / soviet \"occupation\" / Oriental art) were OK - but I was hoping - given the huge size of the building - there may be a wider selection of artifacts on show. However, on",
          "Very moving exhibits with startling statistics about how many Georgians were killed by the Bolsheviks.",

          "I visited what may not be the main gallery of the National Museum. Half of it is dedicated to the works of Pirosmani, and the rest to a small number of Georgian artists, including Kakabadze, whose landscapes I loved, Kikodze and Akhveliani. I enjoyed my visit very much, and",
          "The Pirosmani exhibit was worth a look and well worth the 5 GEL admission. Stop by if you have some free time. Prospero's book store and cafe on the other side of the street will give you a good cup of coffee afterwards.",

          "I was fascinated by the part on the Soviet Occupation of 1921-1991, which shows visitors a true account of what the Communist regimes did not only in Georgia but in all of Eastern Europe. Also, the Treasures of Georgia were very impressive, and the gold artifacts so well",
          "This is a great place to see. You can easily combine this trip with Bolnisi Sioni's Cathedral and Tsugrugasheni, VIII century church. If you make this as a day trip, you can enjoy the views of this old fortress and the views of town of Dmanisi. The nature is really nice. The",

          "Interesting and comprehnsive museum. Highly advisable for all history and archeology enthusiasts. You can easily spend 3 hours there. The Soviet occupation museum was eye opening.",
          "This is a good place for the first time tourist to visit to get to know Georgian culture and how the area has evolved over the ages.\nTickets are very reasonably priced and the museum has been very well curated.\nAt the ground level you'll \u2026",
          "Plenty to see in this beautiful old building, the highlight for us was the museum of Russian occupation - the Georgians are not shy about reminding everyone about how miserable life was under communist rule. Inexpensive to get in & worth the cost. Nice little cafe & you'll easily spend a few hours here",
          "It's not huge but they've displayed what they have really well. Absolutely loved the human evolution display.",
          "Awesome history, amazing building.",
          "The museum staffs don't accept the title of \"Student\" as the occupation on the passport for getting the student priced ticket, so make sure to get a valid International University ID with you if you are a student and would like to buy the \u2026",

          "\ud83d\udcb0 There is a daily pass, that costs 20 lari and allows you to visit 5 museums in one day. Of course, you can't visit all of them, but can choose 2-3 and save some money.\n\nI will recommend you to choose this museum, the National Gallery and \u2026",
          "This is a must to be done during your holiday in Tbilisi!",
          "Quite interesting exhibition",
          "Very rude staff who turn off the lights and locks the exhibitions even before 15 mins to closure when you re inside. I could not visit all exhibitions due to their stupid behaviour to close earlier just to go home early. The content in museum should be fine overall.",
          "This museum is truly one of Tbilisi's many treasures.  Within its walls is a vast and well-presented collection of art work and historical artifacts documenting the rich past and present of Georgia.  Particularly moving was the exhibit on \u2026",
          "Impressive museum in Georgia. Really, really good.",
          "Cheap activity - worth it if you take your time reading the signs. A great starting point for Georgian history!",

          "I personally am not a great lover of museums but this one is worth a visit. Nice lockers to put your jackets, backpacks or shopping in so you can wander around unhindered and enjoy the displays or have some cake and tea at the restaurant. We were not allowed to take photos though.",
          "Very interesting exposition. Highly recommend.",
          "This section was my absolute favourite! However, I expected to see some pictures or information about Rustaveli.",
          "Excellent set of exhibits, of a little random. The coins and treasures exhibit and the history of the Soviet occupation exhibits were especially interesting to us, and other might enjoy the religious artifacts or the natural sciences exhibits. Enough to keep you occupied for a few hours.",
          "If there is a museum to visit in Tbilisi, it is definitely the GNM. Impressive collections with many exhibitions. It also has a small snack bar located at the ground floor. Entrance fees very reasonable for such a monumental museum (7 GEL).",

          "Quite unimpressive collection of manufacts when compared to the History Museum of Armenia in Yerevan.",
          "The section on Soviet Georgia was very moving and very nicely done. You can also see Joseph Stalin's desk here. The last section is worth the price of admission alone and is by far the best part of the museum.",
          "Nice place with alot of local history...",
          "A magnificent collection of antiquities, until the 18th century BC. Worth be seeing.",
          "Beautiful museum, great collection of different times. I loved it!",
          "Wonderful museum which goes into the diverse history of Georgia. Hominins have been wondering through the Caucuses for over a million years. The fossils, ancient coins from Rome, Persia, and Prussia, the clothing, and weapons on display make this a well worth stop.",
          "Love this place! Adult entry cost 15GEL which is really good value. If you are a student, bring your student card along and you go in for 0.5 GEL ! Georgia has a long history being at the cross roads of early Christianity and the rest of \u2026",
          "Great ancient history/biology exhibits. Many items need better multilingual descriptions, the museum is large but not enough benches. Photoshooting is allowed without flash, no videography. The air conditioning was pretty amazing in the Georgian summer heat.",
          "With italian arts gallery this museum got 5 stars from me! Pre-historical section is especially good",
          "Good partly child-friendly museum with nice and big human evolution and wildlife sections (good for kids!). The other sections show a lot of findings like pottery, jewelry, clothes. The Soviet martyr part lacks history about what, how and why things happened. Everything is displayed perfectly though!",
          "Beautiful and surprising artifacts. Beautiful art and items from 300,000 BC. Only thing I would include would be English translation to info in middle of Soviet Occupation room. Every other place has translation except that area.",

          "Great exhibitions. And what's really important: it's got enough seats to recover.",
          "The entrance fee is 3 lari for adults, which granted access to a single medium sized room of the museum on the second floor, the other one was closed due to maintenance, which we were not informed about. The top floors were not accessible. To access the room on the ground floor, additional 45 lari must be paid for a tour guide.",
          "Underwhelming. Mostly ancient artifacts and rocks. The only thing worth visiting is the top floor which contains the museum of Soviet occupation.",
          "Good place to don't forget Georgian history",
          "Impolite staff. Not baby friendly. Staff was not helpful at all, telling my wife to give bottle outside the room, even though she was quiet and docile. Very bad impression, unlike any other museum we visited before around the world. Not recommended.",
          "Fascinating collection of historically important Georgian artefacts. Can recommend to anyone who's interested about the rich story of the country!",
          "Beautiful.\nNice things to see.\nWorth visiting",
          "A big museum with a lot to see. Very interesting items in there. Clearly labeled and easily navigated. Ticket isnt expensive but souvenirs are expensive.\nReally great if you like museums. Depending on how fast you move among different areas and items, it can take an hour or more.",
          "Well, I enjoyed the atmosphere, the design and environment was professional, maybe the ticket price is a little bit expensive (15 Gel). Totally nice to visit \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Very culturally significant museum with a great series of exhibitions and showcases. Definitely will take a good 4-5 hours to cover it properly. Would recommended take a guided tour for the entire experience.",
          "Definitely worth your visit! Wonderful anthropological and historical collections! The Colchis works of goldmithery are mindblowing.The Soviet occupation exhibition on the fourth floor, though a heavy emotional experience, should not be missed as well.",

          "Covers lots of different things in bite-sized chunks, from ancient jewellery to an impressive collection of stuffed wildlife. The Russian Occupation display is powerful, but a large section of that doesn't have any English translations, unfortunately.",
          "Very interesting excibitions. Worth going.",
          "Its very interesting I'd like go there once again",
          "Five stars for the communist exhibition on the third floor. Very well presented, and informative. I didn't know that as many as 880.000 Georgians were killed or deported during the Soviet years. The population was 5 million before the second world war and is much less today.",
          "It has a complete exposition of the Georgian history, from the prehistoric era (with skulls and bones) until the Russian occupation. The entrance is 7 lari. If you like history it could be a good budget option for a rainy day.",

          "Jaw-dropping collection of first millennium (and much, much earlier) treasures, any one of which would have pride of place in other European museums. Great provision of English translations but don't miss the guide leaflets at the entrance. \u2026",

          "Not very big for a national museum, but nice. Very interesting the area dedicated to Stalin Purge on the last floor.",
          "Old-schooled museum mostly about artifacts and descriptions. Most of them are like \"This is a necklace made of gold and red stone, 4th century AD\". There is little story behind the artifacts, you don't get to know much about the culture, \u2026",

Established by the Arabs during their invasions of Georgian lands, the emirate was an important outpost of the Muslim rule in the Caucasus until recaptured by the Georgians under King David IV in 1122. Since then, the city has served as the capital of Georgia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Arabs first appeared in Georgia, namely in Kartli (Iberia) in 645. It was not, however, until 735, when they succeeded in establishing their firm control over a large portion of the country. In that year, Marwan II took hold of Tbilisi and much of the neighbouring lands and installed there an Arab emir, who was to be confirmed by the Caliph or, occasionally, by the ostikan of Arm\u012bniya.\nDuring the Arab period, Tbilisi (al-Tefelis) grew into a center of trade between the Islamic world and northern Europe. Beyond that, it functioned as a key Arab outpost and a buffer province facing the Byzantine and Khazar dominions. Over time, Tbilisi became largely Muslim, but the Islamic influences were strictly confined to the city itself, while the environs remained largely Christian.\nTbilisi was a large city with a strong double wall pierced by three gates. It lay on both banks of the Kura River, and the two parts were connected by a bridge of boats. The contemporary geographers especially mention its thermal springs, which supplied the baths with constant hot waters. On the river were water-mills. The houses were primarily built, to the surprise of contemporary Arab travelers, of pine wood. In the first half of the ninth century, Tbilisi is said to have been the second largest, after Derbend, a city in the Caucasus, with its at least 50,000 inhabitants and thriving commerce. Several intellectuals born or living in Tbilisi, bearing the nisba al-Tiflisi were known across the Muslim world.The Abbasid Caliphate weakened after the Abbasid civil war in the 810s, and caliphal power was challenged by secessionist tendencies among peripheral rulers, including those of Tbilisi. At the same time, the emirate became a target of the resurgent Georgian Bagrationi dynasty who were expanding their territory from Tao-Klarjeti across Georgian lands. The Emirate of Tbilisi grew in relative strength under Ishaq ibn Isma'il (833\u2013853), who was powerful enough to quell the energies of the Georgian princes and to contend with the Abbasid authority in the region. He withheld his annual payment of tribute to Baghdad, and declared his independence from the Caliph. To suppress the rebellion, in 853 Caliph al-Mutawakkil dispatched a punitive expedition led by Bugha al-Kabir (also known as Bugha the Turk) who burned Tbilisi to the ground and had Ishaq decapitated, putting an end to the city's chance to become the center of an independent Islamic state in the Caucasus. The Abbasids chose not to rebuild the city extensively, and as a result the Muslim prestige and authority in the region began to wane.\nBeginning in the 1020s, the Georgian kings pursued a contradictory but generally expansionist policy against the emirs of Tbilisi, this latter coming sporadically under Georgian control. The territories of the emirate shrank to Tbilisi and its immediate environs. However, the Seljuk invasions of the 1070s\u20131080s thwarted the Georgian advance and deferred the Bagratid plans for nearly a half of a century. The last line of emirs of Tbilisi ended, presumably, circa 1080, and the city was run thereafter by the merchant oligarchy known in the Georgian annals as tbileli berebi, that is,  the elders of Tbilisi. Georgian King David IV\u2019s victories over the Seljuk Turks inflicted a final blow to Islamic Tbilisi, and a Georgian army entered the city in 1122, ending four hundred years of Muslim rule.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe office of emir \u2014 amira or amirtamira \u2014 now an appointed Georgian royal official \u2014 survived in Tbilisi, as well as other big cities of Georgia, into the 18th century, being substituted by the office of mouravi.\n\n\n== Rulers ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAllen, WED (1932), A History of the Georgian People, K.

        "wiki": "Tbilisi (English:  t\u0259-bih-LEE-see, t\u0259-BIL-ih-see; Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 [t\u02b0bilisi] (listen)), in some countries also still known by its pre-1936 international designation, Tiflis ( TIF-lis), is the capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of approximately 1.5 million people. Tbilisi was founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tbilisi was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy, governing both Southern and Northern Caucasus.\nBecause of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global powers. The city's location to this day ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and the Modern structures.\nHistorically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though it is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Its notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from 20 to 32 \u00b0C (68 to 90 \u00b0F) in the summer and 7 to \u22121 \u00b0C (45 to 30 \u00b0F) in the winter.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe name Tbilisi derives from Old Georgian t\u2032bilisi (Asomtavruli: \u10b2\u10a1\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8\u10b1\u10a8, Mkhedruli: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8), and further from tpili (Modern Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8, 'warm', itself from Old Georgian: \u10b2\u10b4\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8 \u1e6dpili). The name T\u2032bili or T\u2032bilisi (literally, 'warm location') was therefore given to the city because of the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs.\nUntil 1936, the name of the city in English and most other languages was Tiflis, while the Georgian name was \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 (Tpilisi).On 17 August 1936, by order of the Soviet leadership, the official Russian names of various cities were changed to more closely match the local language. In addition, the Georgian-language form T\u2032pilisi was modernized on the basis of a proposal by Georgian linguists; the ancient Georgian component \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (tpili, 'warm') was replaced by the newer \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (t\u2032bili). This form was the basis for a new official Russian name (\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438 Tbilisi).  Most other languages have subsequently adopted the new name form, but some languages such as Turkish, Persian, Greek, and German have retained a variation of Tiflis.\nOn 20 September 2006, the Georgian parliament held a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the renaming.\nSome of the traditional names of Tbilisi in other languages of the region have different roots.  The Ossetian name \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a (Kalak) derives from the Georgian word \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e5\u10d8 (kalaki) meaning simply 'town'. Chechen and Ingush names for the city use a form similar to or the same as their names for the country of Georgia (\u0413\u0443\u044c\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0445 G\u00fcr\u01b6ex) as does the historical Kabardian name (\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0436\u044b Kwrd\u017e\u0259), while Abkhaz \u049a\u0430\u0440\u04ad (\u0136ar\u0163) is from the Mingrelian \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8 (Karti).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi since the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age. During the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus. According to legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted variant of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King Vakhtang I of Iberia (r. c. 447/49 \u2013 502/22) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either a hawk or other small birds of prey in the legend). The King's falcon allegedly caught or injured a pheasant during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died from burns. King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and build a city on the location.\nKing Dachi of Iberia (r. 522\u2013534), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved the capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries. From the 6th century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region's strategic location along important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.\n\n\n=== Foreign domination ===\n\nTbilisi's favorable trade location, however, did not necessarily bode well for its survival. Located strategically in the heart of the Caucasus between Europe and Asia, Tbilisi became an object of rivalry among the region's various powers such as the Roman Empire, Parthia, Sassanid Persia, Muslim Arabs, the Byzantine Empire, and the Seljuk Turks. The cultural development of the city was somewhat dependent on who ruled the city at various times, although Tbilisi was fairly cosmopolitan.\nFrom 570\u2013580, the Persians ruled the city until 627, when Tbilisi was sacked by the Byzantine/Khazar armies and later, in 736\u2013738, Arab armies entered the town under Marwan II. After this point, the Arabs established an emirate centered in Tbilisi. In 764, Tbilisi \u2013 still under Arab control \u2013 was once again sacked by the Khazars. In 853, the armies of Arab leader Bugha Al-Turki invaded Tbilisi in order to enforce its return to Abbasid allegiance. The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050. In 1068, the city was once again sacked, only this time by the Seljuk Turks under Sultan Alp Arslan.\n\n\n=== Capital of Georgia ===\nIn 1121, after heavy fighting with the Seljuks, the troops of the King of Georgia David IV of Georgia besieged Tbilisi, which ended in 1122 and as a result David moved his residence from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State and thus inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age. From 12\u201313th centuries, Tbilisi became a regional power with a thriving economy and astonishing cultural output. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and a cultural center not only for Georgia but for the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. During Queen Tamar's reign, Shota Rustaveli worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. This period is often referred to as \"Georgia's Golden Age\" or the Georgian Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Mongol domination and the following period of instability ===\nTbilisi's \"Golden Age\" did not last for more than a century. In 1226, Tbilisi was captured by the Khwarezmian Empire Shah Jalal ad-Din and its defences severely devastated and prone to Mongol armies. In 1236, after suffering crushing defeats to the Mongols, Georgia came under Mongol domination. The nation itself maintained a form of semi-independence and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi was strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols retreated from Georgia and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state once again. An outbreak of the plague struck the city in 1366.\nFrom the late 14th until the end of the 18th century, Tbilisi came under the rule of various foreign invaders once again and on several occasions was completely burnt to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was invaded by the armies of Tamerlane. In 1444, the city was invaded and destroyed by Jahan Shah (the Shah of the town of Tabriz in Persia). From 1477 to 1478 the city was held by the Ak Koyunlu tribesmen of Uzun Hassan.\n\n\n=== Iranian control ===\n\nAs early as the 1510s, Tbilisi (and the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) were made vassal territories of Safavid Iran. In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force. Following the death of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524), king David X of Kartli expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards. With the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of vali. Under the later rules of Teimuraz II and Heraclius II, Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule\u2014but, fearful of the constant threat of invasion, Georgia's rulers sought Russian protection in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Despite this agreement, the city was captured and devastated in 1795 by the Iranian Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who sought to re-establish Iran's traditional sovereignty over the region.\n\n\n=== Russian control ===\n\nIn 1801, the Russian Empire annexed the Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (of which Tbilisi was the capital), later cementing its rule with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, which ended Iranian control of Georgia. Tbilisi became the center of the Tbilisi Governorate (Gubernia). Russian Imperial administrators implemented a new European-style city plan and commissioned new buildings in Western styles. Roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in the Russian Empire, such as Batumi and Poti. By the 1850s, Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and a cultural center. The likes of Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Iakob Gogebashvili, Alexander Griboyedov and many other statesmen, poets and artists all found their home in Tbilisi. The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov, the Romanov family and others. The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day Rustaveli Avenue), on which the Viceroys of the Caucasus established their residence. For much of the 19th century, Tbilisi's largest ethnic group was Armenian, who, at some point, formed 74.3% of the population.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Brief independence ===\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city served as a location of the Transcaucasus interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent Transcaucasian Federation with the capital in Tbilisi. At this time, Tbilisi had roughly the same number of Armenians as Georgians, with Russians being the third largest ethnic group. It was here, in the former Caucasus Vice royal Palace, where the independence of three Transcaucasus nations \u2013 Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2013 was declared on 26 to 28 May 1918. After this, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until 25 February 1921. From 1918 to 1919 the city was also consecutively home to a German and British military headquarters.\nUnder the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian University City after the Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918. On 25 February 1921, the Bolshevist Russian 11th Red Army invaded Tbilisi and after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city, declared Soviet rule.\n\n\n=== Soviet rule ===\n\nIn 1921, the Democratic Republic of Georgia was occupied by the Soviet Bolshevik forces from Russia, and until 1936 Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the Transcaucasian SFSR (which included Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), and afterwards until 1991 as the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized, and it also came to be an important political, social, and cultural centre of the Soviet Union. In 1980 the city housed the first state-sanctioned rock festival in the USSR. As a major tourist destination for both Soviet citizens and foreign visitors, Tbilisi's \"Old Town\" (the neighborhoods within the original city walls) was reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s.Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the 9 March Massacre, in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of Nikita Khrushchev. Peaceful protests occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the April 9 tragedy was a peaceful protest that turned violent.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nSince the break-up of the Soviet Union, Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war, which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-Gamsakhurdia and Opposition forces clashed), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations among various mafia clans and illegal business operators. Even during the Shevardnadze Era (1993\u20132003), crime and corruption became rampant at most levels of society. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the Rose Revolution. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with decreasing crime rates, an improved economy, and a real estate boom. During the 2008 South Ossetia war, the Tbilisi area was hit by multiple Russian air attacks.\nAfter the war, several large-scale projects were started, including a streetcar system, a railway bypass and a relocation of the central station, and new urban highways. In June 2015, a flood killed at least twelve people and caused animals from the city's zoo to be released into the streets.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\nThe status of Tbilisi, as the nation's capital, is defined by the Article 10 in the Constitution of Georgia (1995) and the Law on Georgia's Capital \u2013 Tbilisi (20 February 1998).Tbilisi is governed by the Tbilisi City Assembly (Sakrebulo) and the Tbilisi City Hall (Meria). The City Assembly and mayor are elected once every four years by direct elections. The Mayor of Tbilisi is Kakha Kaladze and the Chairman of the Tbilisi city Assembly is Giorgi Alibegashvili.\n\nAdministratively, the city is divided into raions (districts), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general subdivision of the Soviet Union. Since Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:\n\nMtatsminda District Including Neighborhoods: Mtatsminda, Sololaki, Vera, Kiketi, Kojori, Shindisi, Tsavkikisi, Tabakhmela\nVake District Including Neighborhoods: Vake, Bagebi, Vazha Pshavela Quarters, Nutsubidze Plateau, Tskneti\nSaburtalo District Including Neighborhoods: Delisi, Vedzisi, Vashlijvari, Bakhtrioni, Khiliani, Didi Dighomi, Zurgovana\nKrtsanisi District Including Neighborhoods: Kala, Ortachala, Ponichala\nIsani District Including Neighborhoods: Avlabari, Navtlughi, Metromsheni, Vazisubani, Eighth Legioni\nSamgori District Including Neighborhoods: Varketili, Third Array, Orkhevi, Dampalo, Lilo, Lower Samgori\nChughureti District Including Neighborhoods: Chughureti, Kukia, Svanetisubani\nDidube District Including Neighborhoods: Didube, Didghomi Massive\nNadzaladevi District Including Neighborhoods: Nadzaladevi, Sanzona, Temka, Lotkini, Old Nadzaladevi\nGldani District Including Neighborhoods: Gldani Massive, Avchala, Mukhiani, GldanulaMost of the raions are named after historic quarters of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognise an informal system of smaller historic neighbourhoods. Such neighbourhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the Right Bank and the Left Bank of the Mt'k'vari. The names of the oldest neighbourhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.\nIn pre-Revolution Tiflis, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:\n\nIn the north part of the town, on the left bank of the Kur\u00e1 and to the south of the railway station, stretches the clean German Quarter, formerly occupied by German immigrants from W\u00fcrttemberg (1818). To the south is the Gruzinian or Georgian Quarter (Avlab\u00e1r). On the right bank of the Kur\u00e1 is the Russian Quarter, the seat of the officials and of the larger business firms. This is adjoined on the south by the Armenian and Persian Bazaars.\nAvlabari is considered \"the integral component of the so-called 'old Tbilisi'\" and is the object of planning and cultural heritage preservation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nTbilisi is located in the South Caucasus at 41\u00b0 43' North Latitude and 44\u00b0 47' East Longitude. The city lies in Eastern Georgia on both banks of the Mt'k'vari River. The elevation of the city ranges from 380\u2013770 metres above sea level (1,250\u20132,530 ft) and has the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the Saguramo Range, to the east and south-east by the Iori Plain, to the south and west by various endings (sub-ranges) of the Trialeti Range.\nThe relief of Tbilisi is complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Mt'k'vari River extends for more than 30 km (19 mi) from the Avchala District to River Lochini. The part of the city which lies on the right side of the Mt'k'vari River, on the other hand, is built along the foothills of the Trialeti Range, the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river Mt'k'vari. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on the right bank of the Mt'k'vari River. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.\nTo the north of the city, there is a large reservoir (commonly known as the Tbilisi Sea) fed by irrigation canals.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTbilisi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with considerable continental and semi-arid influences. The city experiences very warm summers and moderately cold winters. Like other regions of Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry period. The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and oceanic (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild microclimate compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.\nThe average annual temperature in Tbilisi is 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). January is the coldest month with an average temperature of 2.3 \u00b0C (36.1 \u00b0F). July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24.9 \u00b0C (76.8 \u00b0F). Daytime high temperatures reach or exceed 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) on an average of 22 days during a typical year.  The absolute minimum recorded temperature is \u221224.4 \u00b0C (\u221211.9 \u00b0F) in January 1883 and the absolute maximum is 42.0 \u00b0C (107.6 \u00b0F) on 17 July 1882. Average annual precipitation is 495.5 mm (19.5 in). May is the wettest month (averaging 77.6 mm (3.1 in) of precipitation) while January is the driest (averaging 18.9 mm (0.7 in) of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15\u201325 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs a multicultural city, Tbilisi is home to more than 100 ethnic groups. Around 89% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azerbaijanis. Along with the above-mentioned groups, Tbilisi is home to other ethnic groups including Ossetians, Abkhazians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Germans, Jews, Estonians, Kurds, Assyrians & Yazidis, and others.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nMore than 95% of the residents of Tbilisi practise some form of Christianity (the most predominant of which is the Georgian Orthodox Church). The Russian Orthodox Church, which is in Full communion with the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church have significant followings as well. A minority of the population (around 1.5%) practises Islam (mainly Shia Islam), while about 0.1% of Tbilisi's population practises Judaism. There is also a Roman Catholic church and the Yazidi Sultan Ezid Temple.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nUp until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding (polo in particular), wrestling, boxing, and marksmanship were the most popular city sports. Influence from the Russian Empire brought more Western sports and activities (billiards, fencing) to Tbilisi.\nThe Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary sports infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 handball arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the Dinamo Arena (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium (24,680 seats). The Sports Palace which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat approximately 11,000 people.\nVere Basketball Hall is a smaller indoor sports arena with a 2,500 seating capacity.\nThe most popular sports in Tbilisi today are football, rugby union, basketball, and wrestling. Also, popular sports include tennis, swimming and water polo. There are several professional football and rugby teams as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. National Basketball Association players Zaza Pachulia and Nikoloz Tskitishvili are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.\nTbilisi's signature football team, Dinamo Tbilisi, has not won a major European championship since the 1980\u20131981 season, when it won the European UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the Euroleague in 1962 but also never repeated any such feat.\nTbilisi will host several Group Phase matches for the EuroBasket 2021 in the country, Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne) and Italy (Milan).\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe large majority of Georgia's media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular Rustavi 2 television channel which gained considerable fame after its coverage of the Rose Revolution. In addition to Rustavi 2, the remaining three out of the four major public television channels of Georgia (including Imedi TV Maestro and the Public Broadcasting Channel) are based in the city. Tbilisi's television market has experienced notable changes since the second half of 2005 when Rustavi 2 successfully bought out the Mze TV company and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation became a shareholder of Imedi Media Holding at the beginning of 2006.\nTbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily 24 Saati (\"24 Hours\"), Rezonansi (\"Resonance\"), Alia, the English-language daily The Messenger, weekly FINANCIAL, Georgia Today, and the English-language weekly The Georgian Times. Out of the city's radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 FM), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.\nRadio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and Byzantine, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Beaux-Arts, Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles. Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801\u20131917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.\nTbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically-inflected Stalinist architecture in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building (\"Imeli\"), now housing the Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi.[2]\n\nTbilisi's postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union's most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi's 1975 Ministry of Roads and the 1984 Wedding Palace. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout \"kamikaze loggia\" overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Soon Tbilisi will have three skyscraper complexes. The Axis Towers, Redix Chavchavadze 64, and the new Ajara Hotel/Business Complex, which is currently under construction, will be the tallest buildings/skyscrapers in the Caucasus.[3]\n\n\n=== Theatre, dance and music ===\n\nThe city has important theatre and music institutions, such as the Tbilisi State Conservatoire, the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre, and the Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre.\n\n\n=== Arts museums and galleries ===\nThe Georgian National Museum gathers several important museums, including the Art Museum of Georgia. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 2012. Two independent contemporary art organisations, Kunsthalle Tbilisi and Open Space of Experimental Art, were founded in 2018.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nTbilisi has important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The Parliament and the government (State Chancellery) buildings of Georgia, the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Sameba Cathedral, the Vorontsov's Palace (also known as the Children's Palace today), the National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia, Tbilisi Circus, The Bridge of Peace, and many state museums are in Tbilisi. During the Soviet times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top four cities in the Soviet Union for the number of museums.\nOut of the city's historic landmarks, the most notable are the Narikala fortress (4th\u201317th century), Anchiskhati Basilica (6th century, built up in the 16th century), Sioni Cathedral (8th century, later rebuilt), and Church of Metekhi, Open Air Museum of Ethnography, Sulfur Bath, and Tbilisi Old City.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nBeyond traditional attractions, Tbilisi has developed burgeoning nightclub culture which started to attract international media attention in the 2010s. The leading clubs such as Bassiani, Mtkvarze, Khidi, and Caf\u00e9 Gallery have featured major international DJs as well as local performers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nWith a GDP at basic prices of 12,147 million Georgian lari (\u20ac4.3 billion) in 2014, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating almost 50 percent of Georgia's GDP. The service sector, including government services, is dominating and contributes 88 percent to GDP. Its GDP per capita of 10,336 Georgian lari (\u20ac3,600) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent. The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi's GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is \u2013 with 22.5 percent \u2013 significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nShota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport is Tbilisi's only international airport, located about 18 kilometres (11 miles) southeast of the city center. Handling 3.16 million passengers in 2017, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the seventeenth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56 million passengers in 11 months of 2018. It is a hub for the National carrier Georgian Airways and a Georgian-Chinese start-up Myway Airlines. \nAs of December 2018, various airlines serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as: London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Vienna, Paris, Doha etc.\nTbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first \"green airport\" in the Caucasus region in 2008.\nNatakhtari Airfield, located 33 km north of Tbilisi in the town of Natakhtari, is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to Batumi, Mestia and Ambrolauri.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tbilisi Metro serves the city with rapid transit subway services. It was the Soviet Union's fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966. The system operates two lines, the Akhmeteli-Varketili Line and the Saburtalo Line. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00 am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.\nThe third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and Tbilisi International Airport with a possible extension to Rustavi, 30 km east of Tbilisi.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nTbilisi had a tram network, since 1883 starting from horse-driven trams and from 25 December 1904 electric tramway. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, electric transport went to a degradation state within the years and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006 together with two trolleybus lines which were left. There are plans to construct a modern tram network.\n\n\n=== Minibus ===\nThe most dominant form of transportation is the minibus. An elaborate minibus system has grown in Tbilisi over the recent years. In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 tetri in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets, they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever he likes.\n\n\n=== Municipal bus ===\nThe second largest form of transportation are the municipal buses which are operated by Tbilisi Transport Company. As of October 2018, 672 buses of various size are servicing the city, majority of them are Ukrainian Bogdan A144 and A092 models along with 143 energy-efficient MAN Lion's City buses. New MAN Lion's City buses were put in service in 2017. Later in 2018, the tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta trucks&Buses won the tender and will be delivering aforementioned order in early 2019. In October 2018, at the Georgian Dream conference, it was announced that all the buses will be changed with new ones by the end of 2019, out of which 90 will be electric. Moreover, Kaladze asserted, that by 2020, Tbilisi will have 200 electric buses and the total number will reach 900.\n\n\n=== Aerial tramways ===\nHistorically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but all of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nSince 2012, Tbilisi has a modern, high-capacity gondola lift which operates between Rike Park and the Narikala fortress; each gondola can carry up to 8 persons. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner Ropeways.Since October 12, 2016, Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects Vake Park with Turtle Lake.\nSince October 2016, another Soviet-era aerial tramway between State University (Maglivi) and University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) is being reconstructed after 13 years of abandonment and is due for opening in April 2018. The original Italian-produced cabins produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti & Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, are being kept as well as the stations.\nDue to mismanagement at the hands of Soviet authorities, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.\n\n\n=== Funicular ===\nTbilisi funicular reopened 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built 1905, connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park, and covering almost 300 m (980 ft) in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower as well as some amusement rides, including a roller-coaster and a ferris wheel.\nThe half-way station of the funicular is just a short way away from Mtatsminda Pantheon, providing easy access to the necropolis.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognised medical education system. The biggest Georgian university is Tbilisi State University which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region. Over 35,000 students are enrolled and the number of faculty and staff (collaborators) is approximately 5,000. Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in Caucasus region \u2013 Tbilisi State Medical University, which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since that university operates as an independent educational institution, TSMU became one of the high-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. There are almost 5000 undergraduate and 203 postgraduate students at the university of whom 10% come from foreign countries.\nGeorgia's main and largest technical university, Georgian Technical University, is in Tbilisi. Georgian Technical University was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by the world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It achieved University status by 1990. The three most popular private higher educational institution in Georgia \u2014The University of Georgia (Tbilisi), Caucasus University, and the Free University of Tbilisi \u2013 are in Tbilisi.\n\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi) is the largest private University in Georgia, with more than 3500 international and local students. It was established in 2005 and soon became a market leader within Georgian educational sector. In 2010, the UG received financing from OPIC (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) for a development of the University's infrastructure and technical equipment. The University of Georgia has various undergraduate and graduate programs and it's the first company in Georgia which offers international certificate programs of the Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Zend technologies and Cisco Academy.\nCaucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB) (established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA). The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through the merger of two higher education schools: European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA). Today Free University comprises three schools \u2014 Business School (ESM), Institute of Asia and Africa and Law School \u2014 delivering academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels. In addition, Free University conducts a wide array of short-term courses and runs several research centers and summer school programs.\nHigher educational institutions in Tbilisi:\n\nTbilisi State University\nIlia State University\nGeorgian Technical University\nTbilisi State Conservatory\nShota Rustaveli Theatre and Film University\nTbilisi State Academy of Arts\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi)\nTbilisi State Medical University\nCaucasus University\nCaucasus International University\nTbilisi Medical Academy\nFree University of Tbilisi\nGrigol Robakidze University \u2013 Alma Mater\nGeorgian American University\nInternational Black Sea University\nGeorgian Institute of Public Affairs\nAgricultural University of Georgia\nInternational School of Economics (ISET)\nThe University of Geomedi\nNew Vision University\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Living in Tbilisi ==\nTbilisi is home to many foreigners.

        "wiki": "Tbilisi (English:  t\u0259-bih-LEE-see, t\u0259-BIL-ih-see; Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 [t\u02b0bilisi] (listen)), in some countries also still known by its pre-1936 international designation, Tiflis ( TIF-lis), is the capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of approximately 1.5 million people. Tbilisi was founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tbilisi was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy, governing both Southern and Northern Caucasus.\nBecause of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global powers. The city's location to this day ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and the Modern structures.\nHistorically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though it is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Its notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from 20 to 32 \u00b0C (68 to 90 \u00b0F) in the summer and 7 to \u22121 \u00b0C (45 to 30 \u00b0F) in the winter.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe name Tbilisi derives from Old Georgian t\u2032bilisi (Asomtavruli: \u10b2\u10a1\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8\u10b1\u10a8, Mkhedruli: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8), and further from tpili (Modern Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8, 'warm', itself from Old Georgian: \u10b2\u10b4\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8 \u1e6dpili). The name T\u2032bili or T\u2032bilisi (literally, 'warm location') was therefore given to the city because of the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs.\nUntil 1936, the name of the city in English and most other languages was Tiflis, while the Georgian name was \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 (Tpilisi).On 17 August 1936, by order of the Soviet leadership, the official Russian names of various cities were changed to more closely match the local language. In addition, the Georgian-language form T\u2032pilisi was modernized on the basis of a proposal by Georgian linguists; the ancient Georgian component \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (tpili, 'warm') was replaced by the newer \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (t\u2032bili). This form was the basis for a new official Russian name (\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438 Tbilisi).  Most other languages have subsequently adopted the new name form, but some languages such as Turkish, Persian, Greek, and German have retained a variation of Tiflis.\nOn 20 September 2006, the Georgian parliament held a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the renaming.\nSome of the traditional names of Tbilisi in other languages of the region have different roots.  The Ossetian name \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a (Kalak) derives from the Georgian word \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e5\u10d8 (kalaki) meaning simply 'town'. Chechen and Ingush names for the city use a form similar to or the same as their names for the country of Georgia (\u0413\u0443\u044c\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0445 G\u00fcr\u01b6ex) as does the historical Kabardian name (\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0436\u044b Kwrd\u017e\u0259), while Abkhaz \u049a\u0430\u0440\u04ad (\u0136ar\u0163) is from the Mingrelian \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8 (Karti).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi since the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age. During the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus. According to legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted variant of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King Vakhtang I of Iberia (r. c. 447/49 \u2013 502/22) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either a hawk or other small birds of prey in the legend). The King's falcon allegedly caught or injured a pheasant during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died from burns. King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and build a city on the location.\nKing Dachi of Iberia (r. 522\u2013534), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved the capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries. From the 6th century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region's strategic location along important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.\n\n\n=== Foreign domination ===\n\nTbilisi's favorable trade location, however, did not necessarily bode well for its survival. Located strategically in the heart of the Caucasus between Europe and Asia, Tbilisi became an object of rivalry among the region's various powers such as the Roman Empire, Parthia, Sassanid Persia, Muslim Arabs, the Byzantine Empire, and the Seljuk Turks. The cultural development of the city was somewhat dependent on who ruled the city at various times, although Tbilisi was fairly cosmopolitan.\nFrom 570\u2013580, the Persians ruled the city until 627, when Tbilisi was sacked by the Byzantine/Khazar armies and later, in 736\u2013738, Arab armies entered the town under Marwan II. After this point, the Arabs established an emirate centered in Tbilisi. In 764, Tbilisi \u2013 still under Arab control \u2013 was once again sacked by the Khazars. In 853, the armies of Arab leader Bugha Al-Turki invaded Tbilisi in order to enforce its return to Abbasid allegiance. The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050. In 1068, the city was once again sacked, only this time by the Seljuk Turks under Sultan Alp Arslan.\n\n\n=== Capital of Georgia ===\nIn 1121, after heavy fighting with the Seljuks, the troops of the King of Georgia David IV of Georgia besieged Tbilisi, which ended in 1122 and as a result David moved his residence from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State and thus inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age. From 12\u201313th centuries, Tbilisi became a regional power with a thriving economy and astonishing cultural output. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and a cultural center not only for Georgia but for the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. During Queen Tamar's reign, Shota Rustaveli worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. This period is often referred to as \"Georgia's Golden Age\" or the Georgian Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Mongol domination and the following period of instability ===\nTbilisi's \"Golden Age\" did not last for more than a century. In 1226, Tbilisi was captured by the Khwarezmian Empire Shah Jalal ad-Din and its defences severely devastated and prone to Mongol armies. In 1236, after suffering crushing defeats to the Mongols, Georgia came under Mongol domination. The nation itself maintained a form of semi-independence and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi was strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols retreated from Georgia and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state once again. An outbreak of the plague struck the city in 1366.\nFrom the late 14th until the end of the 18th century, Tbilisi came under the rule of various foreign invaders once again and on several occasions was completely burnt to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was invaded by the armies of Tamerlane. In 1444, the city was invaded and destroyed by Jahan Shah (the Shah of the town of Tabriz in Persia). From 1477 to 1478 the city was held by the Ak Koyunlu tribesmen of Uzun Hassan.\n\n\n=== Iranian control ===\n\nAs early as the 1510s, Tbilisi (and the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) were made vassal territories of Safavid Iran. In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force. Following the death of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524), king David X of Kartli expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards. With the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of vali. Under the later rules of Teimuraz II and Heraclius II, Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule\u2014but, fearful of the constant threat of invasion, Georgia's rulers sought Russian protection in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Despite this agreement, the city was captured and devastated in 1795 by the Iranian Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who sought to re-establish Iran's traditional sovereignty over the region.\n\n\n=== Russian control ===\n\nIn 1801, the Russian Empire annexed the Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (of which Tbilisi was the capital), later cementing its rule with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, which ended Iranian control of Georgia. Tbilisi became the center of the Tbilisi Governorate (Gubernia). Russian Imperial administrators implemented a new European-style city plan and commissioned new buildings in Western styles. Roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in the Russian Empire, such as Batumi and Poti. By the 1850s, Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and a cultural center. The likes of Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Iakob Gogebashvili, Alexander Griboyedov and many other statesmen, poets and artists all found their home in Tbilisi. The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov, the Romanov family and others. The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day Rustaveli Avenue), on which the Viceroys of the Caucasus established their residence. For much of the 19th century, Tbilisi's largest ethnic group was Armenian, who, at some point, formed 74.3% of the population.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Brief independence ===\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city served as a location of the Transcaucasus interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent Transcaucasian Federation with the capital in Tbilisi. At this time, Tbilisi had roughly the same number of Armenians as Georgians, with Russians being the third largest ethnic group. It was here, in the former Caucasus Vice royal Palace, where the independence of three Transcaucasus nations \u2013 Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2013 was declared on 26 to 28 May 1918. After this, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until 25 February 1921. From 1918 to 1919 the city was also consecutively home to a German and British military headquarters.\nUnder the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian University City after the Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918. On 25 February 1921, the Bolshevist Russian 11th Red Army invaded Tbilisi and after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city, declared Soviet rule.\n\n\n=== Soviet rule ===\n\nIn 1921, the Democratic Republic of Georgia was occupied by the Soviet Bolshevik forces from Russia, and until 1936 Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the Transcaucasian SFSR (which included Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), and afterwards until 1991 as the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized, and it also came to be an important political, social, and cultural centre of the Soviet Union. In 1980 the city housed the first state-sanctioned rock festival in the USSR. As a major tourist destination for both Soviet citizens and foreign visitors, Tbilisi's \"Old Town\" (the neighborhoods within the original city walls) was reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s.Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the 9 March Massacre, in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of Nikita Khrushchev. Peaceful protests occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the April 9 tragedy was a peaceful protest that turned violent.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nSince the break-up of the Soviet Union, Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war, which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-Gamsakhurdia and Opposition forces clashed), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations among various mafia clans and illegal business operators. Even during the Shevardnadze Era (1993\u20132003), crime and corruption became rampant at most levels of society. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the Rose Revolution. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with decreasing crime rates, an improved economy, and a real estate boom. During the 2008 South Ossetia war, the Tbilisi area was hit by multiple Russian air attacks.\nAfter the war, several large-scale projects were started, including a streetcar system, a railway bypass and a relocation of the central station, and new urban highways. In June 2015, a flood killed at least twelve people and caused animals from the city's zoo to be released into the streets.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\nThe status of Tbilisi, as the nation's capital, is defined by the Article 10 in the Constitution of Georgia (1995) and the Law on Georgia's Capital \u2013 Tbilisi (20 February 1998).Tbilisi is governed by the Tbilisi City Assembly (Sakrebulo) and the Tbilisi City Hall (Meria). The City Assembly and mayor are elected once every four years by direct elections. The Mayor of Tbilisi is Kakha Kaladze and the Chairman of the Tbilisi city Assembly is Giorgi Alibegashvili.\n\nAdministratively, the city is divided into raions (districts), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general subdivision of the Soviet Union. Since Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:\n\nMtatsminda District Including Neighborhoods: Mtatsminda, Sololaki, Vera, Kiketi, Kojori, Shindisi, Tsavkikisi, Tabakhmela\nVake District Including Neighborhoods: Vake, Bagebi, Vazha Pshavela Quarters, Nutsubidze Plateau, Tskneti\nSaburtalo District Including Neighborhoods: Delisi, Vedzisi, Vashlijvari, Bakhtrioni, Khiliani, Didi Dighomi, Zurgovana\nKrtsanisi District Including Neighborhoods: Kala, Ortachala, Ponichala\nIsani District Including Neighborhoods: Avlabari, Navtlughi, Metromsheni, Vazisubani, Eighth Legioni\nSamgori District Including Neighborhoods: Varketili, Third Array, Orkhevi, Dampalo, Lilo, Lower Samgori\nChughureti District Including Neighborhoods: Chughureti, Kukia, Svanetisubani\nDidube District Including Neighborhoods: Didube, Didghomi Massive\nNadzaladevi District Including Neighborhoods: Nadzaladevi, Sanzona, Temka, Lotkini, Old Nadzaladevi\nGldani District Including Neighborhoods: Gldani Massive, Avchala, Mukhiani, GldanulaMost of the raions are named after historic quarters of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognise an informal system of smaller historic neighbourhoods. Such neighbourhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the Right Bank and the Left Bank of the Mt'k'vari. The names of the oldest neighbourhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.\nIn pre-Revolution Tiflis, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:\n\nIn the north part of the town, on the left bank of the Kur\u00e1 and to the south of the railway station, stretches the clean German Quarter, formerly occupied by German immigrants from W\u00fcrttemberg (1818). To the south is the Gruzinian or Georgian Quarter (Avlab\u00e1r). On the right bank of the Kur\u00e1 is the Russian Quarter, the seat of the officials and of the larger business firms. This is adjoined on the south by the Armenian and Persian Bazaars.\nAvlabari is considered \"the integral component of the so-called 'old Tbilisi'\" and is the object of planning and cultural heritage preservation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nTbilisi is located in the South Caucasus at 41\u00b0 43' North Latitude and 44\u00b0 47' East Longitude. The city lies in Eastern Georgia on both banks of the Mt'k'vari River. The elevation of the city ranges from 380\u2013770 metres above sea level (1,250\u20132,530 ft) and has the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the Saguramo Range, to the east and south-east by the Iori Plain, to the south and west by various endings (sub-ranges) of the Trialeti Range.\nThe relief of Tbilisi is complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Mt'k'vari River extends for more than 30 km (19 mi) from the Avchala District to River Lochini. The part of the city which lies on the right side of the Mt'k'vari River, on the other hand, is built along the foothills of the Trialeti Range, the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river Mt'k'vari. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on the right bank of the Mt'k'vari River. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.\nTo the north of the city, there is a large reservoir (commonly known as the Tbilisi Sea) fed by irrigation canals.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTbilisi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with considerable continental and semi-arid influences. The city experiences very warm summers and moderately cold winters. Like other regions of Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry period. The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and oceanic (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild microclimate compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.\nThe average annual temperature in Tbilisi is 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). January is the coldest month with an average temperature of 2.3 \u00b0C (36.1 \u00b0F). July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24.9 \u00b0C (76.8 \u00b0F). Daytime high temperatures reach or exceed 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) on an average of 22 days during a typical year.  The absolute minimum recorded temperature is \u221224.4 \u00b0C (\u221211.9 \u00b0F) in January 1883 and the absolute maximum is 42.0 \u00b0C (107.6 \u00b0F) on 17 July 1882. Average annual precipitation is 495.5 mm (19.5 in). May is the wettest month (averaging 77.6 mm (3.1 in) of precipitation) while January is the driest (averaging 18.9 mm (0.7 in) of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15\u201325 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs a multicultural city, Tbilisi is home to more than 100 ethnic groups. Around 89% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azerbaijanis. Along with the above-mentioned groups, Tbilisi is home to other ethnic groups including Ossetians, Abkhazians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Germans, Jews, Estonians, Kurds, Assyrians & Yazidis, and others.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nMore than 95% of the residents of Tbilisi practise some form of Christianity (the most predominant of which is the Georgian Orthodox Church). The Russian Orthodox Church, which is in Full communion with the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church have significant followings as well. A minority of the population (around 1.5%) practises Islam (mainly Shia Islam), while about 0.1% of Tbilisi's population practises Judaism. There is also a Roman Catholic church and the Yazidi Sultan Ezid Temple.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nUp until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding (polo in particular), wrestling, boxing, and marksmanship were the most popular city sports. Influence from the Russian Empire brought more Western sports and activities (billiards, fencing) to Tbilisi.\nThe Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary sports infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 handball arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the Dinamo Arena (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium (24,680 seats). The Sports Palace which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat approximately 11,000 people.\nVere Basketball Hall is a smaller indoor sports arena with a 2,500 seating capacity.\nThe most popular sports in Tbilisi today are football, rugby union, basketball, and wrestling. Also, popular sports include tennis, swimming and water polo. There are several professional football and rugby teams as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. National Basketball Association players Zaza Pachulia and Nikoloz Tskitishvili are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.\nTbilisi's signature football team, Dinamo Tbilisi, has not won a major European championship since the 1980\u20131981 season, when it won the European UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the Euroleague in 1962 but also never repeated any such feat.\nTbilisi will host several Group Phase matches for the EuroBasket 2021 in the country, Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne) and Italy (Milan).\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe large majority of Georgia's media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular Rustavi 2 television channel which gained considerable fame after its coverage of the Rose Revolution. In addition to Rustavi 2, the remaining three out of the four major public television channels of Georgia (including Imedi TV Maestro and the Public Broadcasting Channel) are based in the city. Tbilisi's television market has experienced notable changes since the second half of 2005 when Rustavi 2 successfully bought out the Mze TV company and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation became a shareholder of Imedi Media Holding at the beginning of 2006.\nTbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily 24 Saati (\"24 Hours\"), Rezonansi (\"Resonance\"), Alia, the English-language daily The Messenger, weekly FINANCIAL, Georgia Today, and the English-language weekly The Georgian Times. Out of the city's radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 FM), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.\nRadio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and Byzantine, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Beaux-Arts, Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles. Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801\u20131917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.\nTbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically-inflected Stalinist architecture in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building (\"Imeli\"), now housing the Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi.[2]\n\nTbilisi's postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union's most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi's 1975 Ministry of Roads and the 1984 Wedding Palace. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout \"kamikaze loggia\" overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Soon Tbilisi will have three skyscraper complexes. The Axis Towers, Redix Chavchavadze 64, and the new Ajara Hotel/Business Complex, which is currently under construction, will be the tallest buildings/skyscrapers in the Caucasus.[3]\n\n\n=== Theatre, dance and music ===\n\nThe city has important theatre and music institutions, such as the Tbilisi State Conservatoire, the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre, and the Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre.\n\n\n=== Arts museums and galleries ===\nThe Georgian National Museum gathers several important museums, including the Art Museum of Georgia. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 2012. Two independent contemporary art organisations, Kunsthalle Tbilisi and Open Space of Experimental Art, were founded in 2018.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nTbilisi has important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The Parliament and the government (State Chancellery) buildings of Georgia, the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Sameba Cathedral, the Vorontsov's Palace (also known as the Children's Palace today), the National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia, Tbilisi Circus, The Bridge of Peace, and many state museums are in Tbilisi. During the Soviet times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top four cities in the Soviet Union for the number of museums.\nOut of the city's historic landmarks, the most notable are the Narikala fortress (4th\u201317th century), Anchiskhati Basilica (6th century, built up in the 16th century), Sioni Cathedral (8th century, later rebuilt), and Church of Metekhi, Open Air Museum of Ethnography, Sulfur Bath, and Tbilisi Old City.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nBeyond traditional attractions, Tbilisi has developed burgeoning nightclub culture which started to attract international media attention in the 2010s. The leading clubs such as Bassiani, Mtkvarze, Khidi, and Caf\u00e9 Gallery have featured major international DJs as well as local performers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nWith a GDP at basic prices of 12,147 million Georgian lari (\u20ac4.3 billion) in 2014, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating almost 50 percent of Georgia's GDP. The service sector, including government services, is dominating and contributes 88 percent to GDP. Its GDP per capita of 10,336 Georgian lari (\u20ac3,600) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent. The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi's GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is \u2013 with 22.5 percent \u2013 significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nShota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport is Tbilisi's only international airport, located about 18 kilometres (11 miles) southeast of the city center. Handling 3.16 million passengers in 2017, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the seventeenth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56 million passengers in 11 months of 2018. It is a hub for the National carrier Georgian Airways and a Georgian-Chinese start-up Myway Airlines. \nAs of December 2018, various airlines serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as: London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Vienna, Paris, Doha etc.\nTbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first \"green airport\" in the Caucasus region in 2008.\nNatakhtari Airfield, located 33 km north of Tbilisi in the town of Natakhtari, is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to Batumi, Mestia and Ambrolauri.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tbilisi Metro serves the city with rapid transit subway services. It was the Soviet Union's fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966. The system operates two lines, the Akhmeteli-Varketili Line and the Saburtalo Line. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00 am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.\nThe third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and Tbilisi International Airport with a possible extension to Rustavi, 30 km east of Tbilisi.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nTbilisi had a tram network, since 1883 starting from horse-driven trams and from 25 December 1904 electric tramway. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, electric transport went to a degradation state within the years and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006 together with two trolleybus lines which were left. There are plans to construct a modern tram network.\n\n\n=== Minibus ===\nThe most dominant form of transportation is the minibus. An elaborate minibus system has grown in Tbilisi over the recent years. In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 tetri in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets, they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever he likes.\n\n\n=== Municipal bus ===\nThe second largest form of transportation are the municipal buses which are operated by Tbilisi Transport Company. As of October 2018, 672 buses of various size are servicing the city, majority of them are Ukrainian Bogdan A144 and A092 models along with 143 energy-efficient MAN Lion's City buses. New MAN Lion's City buses were put in service in 2017. Later in 2018, the tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta trucks&Buses won the tender and will be delivering aforementioned order in early 2019. In October 2018, at the Georgian Dream conference, it was announced that all the buses will be changed with new ones by the end of 2019, out of which 90 will be electric. Moreover, Kaladze asserted, that by 2020, Tbilisi will have 200 electric buses and the total number will reach 900.\n\n\n=== Aerial tramways ===\nHistorically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but all of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nSince 2012, Tbilisi has a modern, high-capacity gondola lift which operates between Rike Park and the Narikala fortress; each gondola can carry up to 8 persons. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner Ropeways.Since October 12, 2016, Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects Vake Park with Turtle Lake.\nSince October 2016, another Soviet-era aerial tramway between State University (Maglivi) and University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) is being reconstructed after 13 years of abandonment and is due for opening in April 2018. The original Italian-produced cabins produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti & Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, are being kept as well as the stations.\nDue to mismanagement at the hands of Soviet authorities, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.\n\n\n=== Funicular ===\nTbilisi funicular reopened 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built 1905, connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park, and covering almost 300 m (980 ft) in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower as well as some amusement rides, including a roller-coaster and a ferris wheel.\nThe half-way station of the funicular is just a short way away from Mtatsminda Pantheon, providing easy access to the necropolis.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognised medical education system. The biggest Georgian university is Tbilisi State University which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region. Over 35,000 students are enrolled and the number of faculty and staff (collaborators) is approximately 5,000. Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in Caucasus region \u2013 Tbilisi State Medical University, which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since that university operates as an independent educational institution, TSMU became one of the high-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. There are almost 5000 undergraduate and 203 postgraduate students at the university of whom 10% come from foreign countries.\nGeorgia's main and largest technical university, Georgian Technical University, is in Tbilisi. Georgian Technical University was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by the world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It achieved University status by 1990. The three most popular private higher educational institution in Georgia \u2014The University of Georgia (Tbilisi), Caucasus University, and the Free University of Tbilisi \u2013 are in Tbilisi.\n\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi) is the largest private University in Georgia, with more than 3500 international and local students. It was established in 2005 and soon became a market leader within Georgian educational sector. In 2010, the UG received financing from OPIC (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) for a development of the University's infrastructure and technical equipment. The University of Georgia has various undergraduate and graduate programs and it's the first company in Georgia which offers international certificate programs of the Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Zend technologies and Cisco Academy.\nCaucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB) (established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA). The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through the merger of two higher education schools: European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA). Today Free University comprises three schools \u2014 Business School (ESM), Institute of Asia and Africa and Law School \u2014 delivering academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels. In addition, Free University conducts a wide array of short-term courses and runs several research centers and summer school programs.\nHigher educational institutions in Tbilisi:\n\nTbilisi State University\nIlia State University\nGeorgian Technical University\nTbilisi State Conservatory\nShota Rustaveli Theatre and Film University\nTbilisi State Academy of Arts\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi)\nTbilisi State Medical University\nCaucasus University\nCaucasus International University\nTbilisi Medical Academy\nFree University of Tbilisi\nGrigol Robakidze University \u2013 Alma Mater\nGeorgian American University\nInternational Black Sea University\nGeorgian Institute of Public Affairs\nAgricultural University of Georgia\nInternational School of Economics (ISET)\nThe University of Geomedi\nNew Vision University\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Living in Tbilisi ==\nTbilisi is home to many foreigners. The number of foreigners living and working in Tbilisi has risen in recent years together with the openings of international schools, businesses, expat's communities, and online networks. Tbilisi is a very safe city. Most of the expatriates are living in Vake, Vera, Saburtalo, and Dighomi. A lot of expatriate communities could be found in Tbilisi. Some of them are charging a membership fee.\nIWA, International Women Association  is a non profit organisation founded in 1996 and its members and participants are International and Georgian women.\nExpats in Tbilisi is an Online Support Network founded by UN and EU Staff Spouses in Georgia Country to support expatriates in finding information and all relevant resources in one place.\nInter-nation International\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTbilisi is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAbo Tbileli, the patron saint of Tbilisi\nBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline\nList of Tbilisians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\nPostcard from the Silk Road -(Georgia), TRAVELS \u2013 ESPECIALLY FOR \u201eZNAD WILII\u201d, Leonard Dro\u017cd\u017cewicz, \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d, Vie\u0161oji \u012fstaiga \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d kult\u016bros pl\u0117tros draugija,ISSN 1392-9712 indeks 327956 nr 1 (57) z 2014 r., pp. 87\u201398, (in Polish)http://www.znadwiliiwilno.lt/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Znad-Wilii-57m.pdf\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the City of Tbilisi",

          "If ,like me, you are constantly looking for a traffic free area for a OK run I\u2019d highly recommend Rike Park. If you run around the perimeter (on really good paths) you can get about an 800m loop- without having to stop every other step for a pedestrian, stray dog or taxi!",

Vake is a settlement that originated on the territory of Old Vera. By the beginning of the 20th century, its borders were: to the east Varaziskhevi, to the north - Vere River, south and southwest - mountain skirts. During this period, the development of Tskneti Street (now Petre Melikishvili Street) reached Varaziskhevi with a small bridge over it. In Tbilisi Development plan of 1906 only the Nobility Gymnasium building is mentioned in this area (currently 1st building of Tbilisi State University). Then Tbilisi Spiritual Seminary was built not far from the gymnasium (later on this building became agricultural institute, now it is one of the clinics of Tbilisi State Medical University [formerly the 9th Hospital]).\nSince January 1906, Vake was incorporated into Tbilisi. Intensive construction began in the 1920s. For a long time, this neighbourhood was connected to the center of Tbilisi only by Melikishvili Street. In 1957, as a result of reconstruction of the lower part of Varaziskhevi, it became connected to Heroes Square. In 1958, Vake-Saburtalo Connection Highway (currently Mikheil Tamarashvili Street) was also constructed.\nCurrently, Vake is one of the largest residential areas of Tbilisi. There are also high schools, research centers, administrative institutions, etc. In 1946, Vake Park was opened (formerly Victory Park, Architect K. Dgebuadze, Dendrologist N. Tsitsishvili). In 1982, Childrens' park and recreation park Mziuri was opened.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGeorgian Soviet Encyclopedia V4, p. 274, Tbilisi, 1979.\nKvirkvelia, T., Old Tbilisi Settlements, pp. 36\u201337, Tbilisi, 1985.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Tbilisi (English:  t\u0259-bih-LEE-see, t\u0259-BIL-ih-see; Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 [t\u02b0bilisi] (listen)), in some countries also still known by its pre-1936 international designation, Tiflis ( TIF-lis), is the capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of approximately 1.5 million people. Tbilisi was founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tbilisi was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy, governing both Southern and Northern Caucasus.\nBecause of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global powers. The city's location to this day ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and the Modern structures.\nHistorically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though it is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Its notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from 20 to 32 \u00b0C (68 to 90 \u00b0F) in the summer and 7 to \u22121 \u00b0C (45 to 30 \u00b0F) in the winter.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe name Tbilisi derives from Old Georgian t\u2032bilisi (Asomtavruli: \u10b2\u10a1\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8\u10b1\u10a8, Mkhedruli: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8), and further from tpili (Modern Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8, 'warm', itself from Old Georgian: \u10b2\u10b4\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8 \u1e6dpili). The name T\u2032bili or T\u2032bilisi (literally, 'warm location') was therefore given to the city because of the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs.\nUntil 1936, the name of the city in English and most other languages was Tiflis, while the Georgian name was \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 (Tpilisi).On 17 August 1936, by order of the Soviet leadership, the official Russian names of various cities were changed to more closely match the local language. In addition, the Georgian-language form T\u2032pilisi was modernized on the basis of a proposal by Georgian linguists; the ancient Georgian component \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (tpili, 'warm') was replaced by the newer \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (t\u2032bili). This form was the basis for a new official Russian name (\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438 Tbilisi).  Most other languages have subsequently adopted the new name form, but some languages such as Turkish, Persian, Greek, and German have retained a variation of Tiflis.\nOn 20 September 2006, the Georgian parliament held a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the renaming.\nSome of the traditional names of Tbilisi in other languages of the region have different roots.  The Ossetian name \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a (Kalak) derives from the Georgian word \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e5\u10d8 (kalaki) meaning simply 'town'. Chechen and Ingush names for the city use a form similar to or the same as their names for the country of Georgia (\u0413\u0443\u044c\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0445 G\u00fcr\u01b6ex) as does the historical Kabardian name (\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0436\u044b Kwrd\u017e\u0259), while Abkhaz \u049a\u0430\u0440\u04ad (\u0136ar\u0163) is from the Mingrelian \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8 (Karti).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi since the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age. During the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus. According to legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted variant of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King Vakhtang I of Iberia (r. c. 447/49 \u2013 502/22) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either a hawk or other small birds of prey in the legend). The King's falcon allegedly caught or injured a pheasant during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died from burns. King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and build a city on the location.\nKing Dachi of Iberia (r. 522\u2013534), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved the capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries. From the 6th century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region's strategic location along important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.\n\n\n=== Foreign domination ===\n\nTbilisi's favorable trade location, however, did not necessarily bode well for its survival. Located strategically in the heart of the Caucasus between Europe and Asia, Tbilisi became an object of rivalry among the region's various powers such as the Roman Empire, Parthia, Sassanid Persia, Muslim Arabs, the Byzantine Empire, and the Seljuk Turks. The cultural development of the city was somewhat dependent on who ruled the city at various times, although Tbilisi was fairly cosmopolitan.\nFrom 570\u2013580, the Persians ruled the city until 627, when Tbilisi was sacked by the Byzantine/Khazar armies and later, in 736\u2013738, Arab armies entered the town under Marwan II. After this point, the Arabs established an emirate centered in Tbilisi. In 764, Tbilisi \u2013 still under Arab control \u2013 was once again sacked by the Khazars. In 853, the armies of Arab leader Bugha Al-Turki invaded Tbilisi in order to enforce its return to Abbasid allegiance. The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050. In 1068, the city was once again sacked, only this time by the Seljuk Turks under Sultan Alp Arslan.\n\n\n=== Capital of Georgia ===\nIn 1121, after heavy fighting with the Seljuks, the troops of the King of Georgia David IV of Georgia besieged Tbilisi, which ended in 1122 and as a result David moved his residence from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State and thus inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age. From 12\u201313th centuries, Tbilisi became a regional power with a thriving economy and astonishing cultural output. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and a cultural center not only for Georgia but for the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. During Queen Tamar's reign, Shota Rustaveli worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. This period is often referred to as \"Georgia's Golden Age\" or the Georgian Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Mongol domination and the following period of instability ===\nTbilisi's \"Golden Age\" did not last for more than a century. In 1226, Tbilisi was captured by the Khwarezmian Empire Shah Jalal ad-Din and its defences severely devastated and prone to Mongol armies. In 1236, after suffering crushing defeats to the Mongols, Georgia came under Mongol domination. The nation itself maintained a form of semi-independence and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi was strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols retreated from Georgia and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state once again. An outbreak of the plague struck the city in 1366.\nFrom the late 14th until the end of the 18th century, Tbilisi came under the rule of various foreign invaders once again and on several occasions was completely burnt to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was invaded by the armies of Tamerlane. In 1444, the city was invaded and destroyed by Jahan Shah (the Shah of the town of Tabriz in Persia). From 1477 to 1478 the city was held by the Ak Koyunlu tribesmen of Uzun Hassan.\n\n\n=== Iranian control ===\n\nAs early as the 1510s, Tbilisi (and the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) were made vassal territories of Safavid Iran. In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force. Following the death of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524), king David X of Kartli expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards. With the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of vali. Under the later rules of Teimuraz II and Heraclius II, Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule\u2014but, fearful of the constant threat of invasion, Georgia's rulers sought Russian protection in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Despite this agreement, the city was captured and devastated in 1795 by the Iranian Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who sought to re-establish Iran's traditional sovereignty over the region.\n\n\n=== Russian control ===\n\nIn 1801, the Russian Empire annexed the Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (of which Tbilisi was the capital), later cementing its rule with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, which ended Iranian control of Georgia. Tbilisi became the center of the Tbilisi Governorate (Gubernia). Russian Imperial administrators implemented a new European-style city plan and commissioned new buildings in Western styles. Roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in the Russian Empire, such as Batumi and Poti. By the 1850s, Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and a cultural center. The likes of Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Iakob Gogebashvili, Alexander Griboyedov and many other statesmen, poets and artists all found their home in Tbilisi. The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov, the Romanov family and others. The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day Rustaveli Avenue), on which the Viceroys of the Caucasus established their residence. For much of the 19th century, Tbilisi's largest ethnic group was Armenian, who, at some point, formed 74.3% of the population.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Brief independence ===\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city served as a location of the Transcaucasus interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent Transcaucasian Federation with the capital in Tbilisi. At this time, Tbilisi had roughly the same number of Armenians as Georgians, with Russians being the third largest ethnic group. It was here, in the former Caucasus Vice royal Palace, where the independence of three Transcaucasus nations \u2013 Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2013 was declared on 26 to 28 May 1918. After this, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until 25 February 1921. From 1918 to 1919 the city was also consecutively home to a German and British military headquarters.\nUnder the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian University City after the Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918. On 25 February 1921, the Bolshevist Russian 11th Red Army invaded Tbilisi and after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city, declared Soviet rule.\n\n\n=== Soviet rule ===\n\nIn 1921, the Democratic Republic of Georgia was occupied by the Soviet Bolshevik forces from Russia, and until 1936 Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the Transcaucasian SFSR (which included Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), and afterwards until 1991 as the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized, and it also came to be an important political, social, and cultural centre of the Soviet Union. In 1980 the city housed the first state-sanctioned rock festival in the USSR. As a major tourist destination for both Soviet citizens and foreign visitors, Tbilisi's \"Old Town\" (the neighborhoods within the original city walls) was reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s.Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the 9 March Massacre, in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of Nikita Khrushchev. Peaceful protests occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the April 9 tragedy was a peaceful protest that turned violent.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nSince the break-up of the Soviet Union, Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war, which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-Gamsakhurdia and Opposition forces clashed), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations among various mafia clans and illegal business operators. Even during the Shevardnadze Era (1993\u20132003), crime and corruption became rampant at most levels of society. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the Rose Revolution. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with decreasing crime rates, an improved economy, and a real estate boom. During the 2008 South Ossetia war, the Tbilisi area was hit by multiple Russian air attacks.\nAfter the war, several large-scale projects were started, including a streetcar system, a railway bypass and a relocation of the central station, and new urban highways. In June 2015, a flood killed at least twelve people and caused animals from the city's zoo to be released into the streets.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\nThe status of Tbilisi, as the nation's capital, is defined by the Article 10 in the Constitution of Georgia (1995) and the Law on Georgia's Capital \u2013 Tbilisi (20 February 1998).Tbilisi is governed by the Tbilisi City Assembly (Sakrebulo) and the Tbilisi City Hall (Meria). The City Assembly and mayor are elected once every four years by direct elections. The Mayor of Tbilisi is Kakha Kaladze and the Chairman of the Tbilisi city Assembly is Giorgi Alibegashvili.\n\nAdministratively, the city is divided into raions (districts), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general subdivision of the Soviet Union. Since Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:\n\nMtatsminda District Including Neighborhoods: Mtatsminda, Sololaki, Vera, Kiketi, Kojori, Shindisi, Tsavkikisi, Tabakhmela\nVake District Including Neighborhoods: Vake, Bagebi, Vazha Pshavela Quarters, Nutsubidze Plateau, Tskneti\nSaburtalo District Including Neighborhoods: Delisi, Vedzisi, Vashlijvari, Bakhtrioni, Khiliani, Didi Dighomi, Zurgovana\nKrtsanisi District Including Neighborhoods: Kala, Ortachala, Ponichala\nIsani District Including Neighborhoods: Avlabari, Navtlughi, Metromsheni, Vazisubani, Eighth Legioni\nSamgori District Including Neighborhoods: Varketili, Third Array, Orkhevi, Dampalo, Lilo, Lower Samgori\nChughureti District Including Neighborhoods: Chughureti, Kukia, Svanetisubani\nDidube District Including Neighborhoods: Didube, Didghomi Massive\nNadzaladevi District Including Neighborhoods: Nadzaladevi, Sanzona, Temka, Lotkini, Old Nadzaladevi\nGldani District Including Neighborhoods: Gldani Massive, Avchala, Mukhiani, GldanulaMost of the raions are named after historic quarters of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognise an informal system of smaller historic neighbourhoods. Such neighbourhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the Right Bank and the Left Bank of the Mt'k'vari. The names of the oldest neighbourhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.\nIn pre-Revolution Tiflis, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:\n\nIn the north part of the town, on the left bank of the Kur\u00e1 and to the south of the railway station, stretches the clean German Quarter, formerly occupied by German immigrants from W\u00fcrttemberg (1818). To the south is the Gruzinian or Georgian Quarter (Avlab\u00e1r). On the right bank of the Kur\u00e1 is the Russian Quarter, the seat of the officials and of the larger business firms. This is adjoined on the south by the Armenian and Persian Bazaars.\nAvlabari is considered \"the integral component of the so-called 'old Tbilisi'\" and is the object of planning and cultural heritage preservation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nTbilisi is located in the South Caucasus at 41\u00b0 43' North Latitude and 44\u00b0 47' East Longitude. The city lies in Eastern Georgia on both banks of the Mt'k'vari River. The elevation of the city ranges from 380\u2013770 metres above sea level (1,250\u20132,530 ft) and has the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the Saguramo Range, to the east and south-east by the Iori Plain, to the south and west by various endings (sub-ranges) of the Trialeti Range.\nThe relief of Tbilisi is complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Mt'k'vari River extends for more than 30 km (19 mi) from the Avchala District to River Lochini. The part of the city which lies on the right side of the Mt'k'vari River, on the other hand, is built along the foothills of the Trialeti Range, the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river Mt'k'vari. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on the right bank of the Mt'k'vari River. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.\nTo the north of the city, there is a large reservoir (commonly known as the Tbilisi Sea) fed by irrigation canals.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTbilisi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with considerable continental and semi-arid influences. The city experiences very warm summers and moderately cold winters. Like other regions of Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry period. The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and oceanic (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild microclimate compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.\nThe average annual temperature in Tbilisi is 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). January is the coldest month with an average temperature of 2.3 \u00b0C (36.1 \u00b0F). July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24.9 \u00b0C (76.8 \u00b0F). Daytime high temperatures reach or exceed 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) on an average of 22 days during a typical year.  The absolute minimum recorded temperature is \u221224.4 \u00b0C (\u221211.9 \u00b0F) in January 1883 and the absolute maximum is 42.0 \u00b0C (107.6 \u00b0F) on 17 July 1882. Average annual precipitation is 495.5 mm (19.5 in). May is the wettest month (averaging 77.6 mm (3.1 in) of precipitation) while January is the driest (averaging 18.9 mm (0.7 in) of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15\u201325 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs a multicultural city, Tbilisi is home to more than 100 ethnic groups. Around 89% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azerbaijanis. Along with the above-mentioned groups, Tbilisi is home to other ethnic groups including Ossetians, Abkhazians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Germans, Jews, Estonians, Kurds, Assyrians & Yazidis, and others.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nMore than 95% of the residents of Tbilisi practise some form of Christianity (the most predominant of which is the Georgian Orthodox Church). The Russian Orthodox Church, which is in Full communion with the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church have significant followings as well. A minority of the population (around 1.5%) practises Islam (mainly Shia Islam), while about 0.1% of Tbilisi's population practises Judaism. There is also a Roman Catholic church and the Yazidi Sultan Ezid Temple.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nUp until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding (polo in particular), wrestling, boxing, and marksmanship were the most popular city sports. Influence from the Russian Empire brought more Western sports and activities (billiards, fencing) to Tbilisi.\nThe Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary sports infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 handball arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the Dinamo Arena (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium (24,680 seats). The Sports Palace which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat approximately 11,000 people.\nVere Basketball Hall is a smaller indoor sports arena with a 2,500 seating capacity.\nThe most popular sports in Tbilisi today are football, rugby union, basketball, and wrestling. Also, popular sports include tennis, swimming and water polo. There are several professional football and rugby teams as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. National Basketball Association players Zaza Pachulia and Nikoloz Tskitishvili are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.\nTbilisi's signature football team, Dinamo Tbilisi, has not won a major European championship since the 1980\u20131981 season, when it won the European UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the Euroleague in 1962 but also never repeated any such feat.\nTbilisi will host several Group Phase matches for the EuroBasket 2021 in the country, Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne) and Italy (Milan).\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe large majority of Georgia's media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular Rustavi 2 television channel which gained considerable fame after its coverage of the Rose Revolution. In addition to Rustavi 2, the remaining three out of the four major public television channels of Georgia (including Imedi TV Maestro and the Public Broadcasting Channel) are based in the city. Tbilisi's television market has experienced notable changes since the second half of 2005 when Rustavi 2 successfully bought out the Mze TV company and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation became a shareholder of Imedi Media Holding at the beginning of 2006.\nTbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily 24 Saati (\"24 Hours\"), Rezonansi (\"Resonance\"), Alia, the English-language daily The Messenger, weekly FINANCIAL, Georgia Today, and the English-language weekly The Georgian Times. Out of the city's radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 FM), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.\nRadio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and Byzantine, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Beaux-Arts, Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles. Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801\u20131917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.\nTbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically-inflected Stalinist architecture in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building (\"Imeli\"), now housing the Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi.[2]\n\nTbilisi's postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union's most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi's 1975 Ministry of Roads and the 1984 Wedding Palace. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout \"kamikaze loggia\" overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Soon Tbilisi will have three skyscraper complexes. The Axis Towers, Redix Chavchavadze 64, and the new Ajara Hotel/Business Complex, which is currently under construction, will be the tallest buildings/skyscrapers in the Caucasus.[3]\n\n\n=== Theatre, dance and music ===\n\nThe city has important theatre and music institutions, such as the Tbilisi State Conservatoire, the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre, and the Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre.\n\n\n=== Arts museums and galleries ===\nThe Georgian National Museum gathers several important museums, including the Art Museum of Georgia. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 2012. Two independent contemporary art organisations, Kunsthalle Tbilisi and Open Space of Experimental Art, were founded in 2018.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nTbilisi has important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The Parliament and the government (State Chancellery) buildings of Georgia, the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Sameba Cathedral, the Vorontsov's Palace (also known as the Children's Palace today), the National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia, Tbilisi Circus, The Bridge of Peace, and many state museums are in Tbilisi. During the Soviet times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top four cities in the Soviet Union for the number of museums.\nOut of the city's historic landmarks, the most notable are the Narikala fortress (4th\u201317th century), Anchiskhati Basilica (6th century, built up in the 16th century), Sioni Cathedral (8th century, later rebuilt), and Church of Metekhi, Open Air Museum of Ethnography, Sulfur Bath, and Tbilisi Old City.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nBeyond traditional attractions, Tbilisi has developed burgeoning nightclub culture which started to attract international media attention in the 2010s. The leading clubs such as Bassiani, Mtkvarze, Khidi, and Caf\u00e9 Gallery have featured major international DJs as well as local performers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nWith a GDP at basic prices of 12,147 million Georgian lari (\u20ac4.3 billion) in 2014, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating almost 50 percent of Georgia's GDP. The service sector, including government services, is dominating and contributes 88 percent to GDP. Its GDP per capita of 10,336 Georgian lari (\u20ac3,600) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent. The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi's GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is \u2013 with 22.5 percent \u2013 significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nShota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport is Tbilisi's only international airport, located about 18 kilometres (11 miles) southeast of the city center. Handling 3.16 million passengers in 2017, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the seventeenth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56 million passengers in 11 months of 2018. It is a hub for the National carrier Georgian Airways and a Georgian-Chinese start-up Myway Airlines. \nAs of December 2018, various airlines serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as: London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Vienna, Paris, Doha etc.\nTbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first \"green airport\" in the Caucasus region in 2008.\nNatakhtari Airfield, located 33 km north of Tbilisi in the town of Natakhtari, is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to Batumi, Mestia and Ambrolauri.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tbilisi Metro serves the city with rapid transit subway services. It was the Soviet Union's fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966. The system operates two lines, the Akhmeteli-Varketili Line and the Saburtalo Line. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00 am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.\nThe third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and Tbilisi International Airport with a possible extension to Rustavi, 30 km east of Tbilisi.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nTbilisi had a tram network, since 1883 starting from horse-driven trams and from 25 December 1904 electric tramway. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, electric transport went to a degradation state within the years and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006 together with two trolleybus lines which were left. There are plans to construct a modern tram network.\n\n\n=== Minibus ===\nThe most dominant form of transportation is the minibus. An elaborate minibus system has grown in Tbilisi over the recent years. In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 tetri in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets, they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever he likes.\n\n\n=== Municipal bus ===\nThe second largest form of transportation are the municipal buses which are operated by Tbilisi Transport Company. As of October 2018, 672 buses of various size are servicing the city, majority of them are Ukrainian Bogdan A144 and A092 models along with 143 energy-efficient MAN Lion's City buses. New MAN Lion's City buses were put in service in 2017. Later in 2018, the tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta trucks&Buses won the tender and will be delivering aforementioned order in early 2019. In October 2018, at the Georgian Dream conference, it was announced that all the buses will be changed with new ones by the end of 2019, out of which 90 will be electric. Moreover, Kaladze asserted, that by 2020, Tbilisi will have 200 electric buses and the total number will reach 900.\n\n\n=== Aerial tramways ===\nHistorically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but all of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nSince 2012, Tbilisi has a modern, high-capacity gondola lift which operates between Rike Park and the Narikala fortress; each gondola can carry up to 8 persons. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner Ropeways.Since October 12, 2016, Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects Vake Park with Turtle Lake.\nSince October 2016, another Soviet-era aerial tramway between State University (Maglivi) and University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) is being reconstructed after 13 years of abandonment and is due for opening in April 2018. The original Italian-produced cabins produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti & Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, are being kept as well as the stations.\nDue to mismanagement at the hands of Soviet authorities, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.\n\n\n=== Funicular ===\nTbilisi funicular reopened 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built 1905, connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park, and covering almost 300 m (980 ft) in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower as well as some amusement rides, including a roller-coaster and a ferris wheel.\nThe half-way station of the funicular is just a short way away from Mtatsminda Pantheon, providing easy access to the necropolis.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognised medical education system. The biggest Georgian university is Tbilisi State University which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region. Over 35,000 students are enrolled and the number of faculty and staff (collaborators) is approximately 5,000. Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in Caucasus region \u2013 Tbilisi State Medical University, which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since that university operates as an independent educational institution, TSMU became one of the high-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. There are almost 5000 undergraduate and 203 postgraduate students at the university of whom 10% come from foreign countries.\nGeorgia's main and largest technical university, Georgian Technical University, is in Tbilisi. Georgian Technical University was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by the world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It achieved University status by 1990. The three most popular private higher educational institution in Georgia \u2014The University of Georgia (Tbilisi), Caucasus University, and the Free University of Tbilisi \u2013 are in Tbilisi.\n\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi) is the largest private University in Georgia, with more than 3500 international and local students. It was established in 2005 and soon became a market leader within Georgian educational sector. In 2010, the UG received financing from OPIC (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) for a development of the University's infrastructure and technical equipment. The University of Georgia has various undergraduate and graduate programs and it's the first company in Georgia which offers international certificate programs of the Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Zend technologies and Cisco Academy.\nCaucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB) (established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA). The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through the merger of two higher education schools: European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA). Today Free University comprises three schools \u2014 Business School (ESM), Institute of Asia and Africa and Law School \u2014 delivering academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels.

          "I visited on a sunny weekday afternoon. It was quite busy with loads of vendors selling almost everything under the sun. I didn\u2019t see a kitchen sink but, did see the taps and I\u2019m sure if I asked, they would have gotten me a sink too. There is some really interesting local art,",
          "The largest flea market in the city is located under and around a bridge from which it gets its name. On sale are all kings of objects including works of art, jewelry, books, household appliances, local artifacts and everyday objects. If you interested in history, you can also",
          "You can spend hours here and we had a lot of fun just by walking around. Incredible how much junk they are trying to sell.",
          "This is an open-air flea market. Good for homemade souvenirs hunting, but be prepared for a bargain! Mostly antique and Old stuff from Russia, art and local crafts. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "A must visit in Tbilisi, but did not find too many things of interest. Lots of second hand items, not too many self produced items.",
          "Actually I was quite surprised; for the most part starting prices weren\u2019t insane, and most will haggle a few GEL - but if you want souvenirs / rugs / ? check a retail store to get an idea of prices and then your set (there\u2019re all selling the same type of stuff and the vendors",
          "The antiques vary in quality, as well as price. I also wasn't impressed when I heard a teasing remark from one of the male stallholders (in his 60s). Having said that, the antiques are not the drawcard here. It is the art that is the star attraction. I have never seen so many",
          "Its a must visit !! You will find a lot of items from soviet era, also some cultural Georgian items to buy.",
          "Great browsing for treasures. Lots of art and local crafts. Also interesting items left over from the occupation of the USSR. Several different restaurants to eat at as well.",
          "A lot of original paintings,old home flea market stuff,we bought a piczure of Tbilisi reasonable priced.Be careful when you walk over the main street, very strong traffic",
          "This market is at the river side and you can find all sorts of things here. Coins, bank notes, jewellery, art, knives, machetes, toy cars, military memorabilia and much more. The people selling do not hassle you and some are willing to haggle. I did like much of the jewellery",
          "Very interesting. It\u2019s not like a giant garage sale. In terms of it being a flea market really it\u2019s like an antique show mixed with an art exhibition. We loved walking through. I wish we had more time (and more weight allowance in our suitcase). I was living in Southeast Asia",
          "As we always do, visiting markets in all cities we are going to, we visited the Flea Market at Dry Bridge. Very average, I have to say, nothing special. not the goods and not the atmosphere. There are better places to see in Tbilisi ...",
          "Soviet era items, instruments, coins, clothes, kitchen items, new and old art. You can find just about anything here. Very interesting and most are willing to bargin with you.",
          "A lovely way to spend part of a day browsing among sometimes curious artifacts, hand-made clothing and a wide selection of objects both young and old. A most pleasant atmosphere where we were able to feast our eyes without the aggressive sales tactics often associated with",
          "It\u2019s not fully open until it\u2019s 11 am. You can find there anything you want even old Soviet army suites and old banknotes. Also if you want to buy some gifts or artworks.",
          "It looks like Georgians are no early starters :-). Visited the place around 11:00h and only 20% of the places were occupied/open. Nice thing: they sell everything :-).",

          "I was for the 3rd time in Tbilisi and for the third time here. Maybe last one (not in Tbilisi hopefully) I was witnessing turning this place towards more and more touristic and less and less authentic. Way to go I suppose. Well, it is still charming. But - if you are looking for",
          "Good to look at. No one bothers you to buy. Some items likes bags etc may be way more priced than in the city shops. Paintings are beautiful. Some used items too, which are interesting. If you have time, visit - doesn\u2019t take more than an hour if you look at items leisurely. I\u2019m",
          "The market was located close to our hotel and we visited late afternoon on a weekday, when there were few visitors. It is divided according to the type of goods sold: art, household goods, cameras, copperware,clothes etc. I particularly appreciated that we were able to look at",
          "I'm not a flea market person, but my husband and his sister really enjoyed looking at all the old things for sale. I will say that there is a very good area with paintings and sculptures reflecting the Georgian culture. I really enjoyed this part.",
          "First, there is a repair part of the market on the sidewalk near the river which can fix most anything! To see all these treasures from chandeliers to silverware to dishes to jewelry, there was just so much to see. However, when you consider it's people selling family",
          "Very quaint place filled with oddities and paintings trinkets antiques and old USSR stuff Friendly people very poor and curious worth dying for. Must bargain paintings are a treat to watch and a must buy",

          "Not really a heck of alot to see. Lots of junk. What is nice is that the are artists displaying their paintings.",
          "Maybe it was the day of the week (a Monday), but we were disappointed in this flea market. The market is spread beneath the Dry Bridge which is also undergoing construction. We saw the usual worn, old trinkets and handicrafts that people try to sell to tourists. There was an",
          "The dry bridge flea market has some great handicrafts but also a lot of junky stuff. It is well worth a stroll through the tables and stands. Not that your going to buy a screw driver or a fan belt for your car but you might pick up a Soviet badge or a felted hat...",
          "Unfortunately the road that the market should be on its currently being dug up so the market has curved around to the side road A fascinating collection of old stuff. Some real quirky items, but more bric-a-brac than antique",
          "The flea market is odd - lots of stuff you'll never want - outdated electronics and electrical equipment. There are some household stuff - but it mostly looks like stuff that people were weeding out of their houses. There is one section that is only handicrafts and art where",
          "This is a fun place to go and experience the history and life of Georgia. You can find many different things, from old Soviet War metals to many different kinds of paintings. In the past the people were more willing to barter but now with the influx of tourism it has become",
          "Interesting flea market, ranging from art, crafts, trinkets, junk and some really cool stuff. Quite a bit of new momento stuff too. Most interesting to me was probably soviet era technology and war. Some of it pretty pricey though, but some real gems at realistic prices.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Some of the usual Market stuff but also woollen scarves slippers etc and local art",
          "I m a sucker for flea market, bought a 1940s still working Russian made camera but couldn\u2019t afford hand wound turn table. Anyway the vendor was asking too much.",
          "You have to go just to see all the items that bring back memories from the 70s, 80s and 90s. As they say one persons trash is another\u2019s treasure. It is great for kids and adults and there are some good souvenirs to be had. My eldest daughter bought a gas mask but you can also",
          "Nice stuff laying around. We were mainly attracted by handmade wool works such as scarfs and socks. You can find old coins, and small items from the soviet union days as well. But that is about it. If you are in the area, it would be good to pass by, otherwise don\u2019t plan for",
          "This flea market is anarchic and the very fact makes it an attraction for tourists. And you must know for sure what you are looking for. If you just happen to come along, it is an option to visit the market and to stroll around. Otherwise, I would say that there are more",
          "The stuff you get here is about history.. if you are an antique lover - this is the place to be. we spent 3 hours at the dry bridge, and at the end of the day we had to buy an additional bag..",
          "It\u2019s neither more nor less than any other flee market. If you\u2019re into such markets, you would probably enjoy visiting this one too.",
          "Interesting enough,hard to walk around as most of the items are laid out on the ground,some interesting art work down the stairs...would have been good to be able to sit some where and have a cold drink...only1 option and that was hard to find..lots of soviet swords and knives",
          "This is just another market nothing special. If you want to buy something cheap you can come here. Not a tourist attraction.",
          "If you are planning to pick up some memorabilia of you visit other than fridge magnets, this is the place to be. Porcelain items, carpets, photos of Stalin, old badges, gramaphone records, jewellery to old brass lampshades, knockers and the list goes on. Smaller items are cheap",
          "An afternoon strolling around looking at a vast array of home made knit wear, clothes, paintings, home wares, and even old turn tables, cassette tapes, LPs and cameras. The list goes on..... worth a slow browse.",
          "its just basically a street version of all the souvenir shops in tibilisi. rows n rows of merchants selling almost everything. old new fake everthing. but dont get mesmerized by the antiques they are selling. i am no expert but lots of it looked like cheap replics. Hey but",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my walkabout this antique, craft and art market. So good deals here and a pleasant place to take a stroll.",
          "Being lovers of all things markets, this particular one is right uo our alley, lots of things to look, take your time, there are bargains to be found, we picked up a nice ring, wearable, souvineer of Tbilisi.",
          "When you visit georgia, don\u2019t ever skip flea market, you will find all antiques, post war kind of things for a very low prices. Just try to bargain if you think the price is too much but nonetheless everything is worth the price.",
          "Incredible flea market located on and along the park attached to Dry Bridge (named because it once had water running under it until the Soviets diverted the river - almost overnight - and so now it just has cars running under it). Try to come in the middle of the day - 1-3pm for",
          "Literally everything. From commercials to privately owned things. Artifacts, handcrafts, junk, everything. All for cheap prices.",
          "Depending on what you\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s ok for Soviet memorabelia, very good for porcelain and quire good for artwork if that\u2019s your taste. Pleasant enough for a couple of hours.",
          "Had a nice afternoon strolling through the markets with our 4 & 5 year old boys. Loved the artwork, the second hand bits and pieces were really odd but it was interesting to walk through. Not many souvenirs in case thinking of buying them there!",
          "The have lots of amazing of paintings (handmade) in addition to wide variety of souvenirs (soft toys, magnets, accessories, chess, and many more)",
          "Well i am big fan of flea markets and love to visit them when i travel. the dry bridge market is very good flea market , and it get more busy at weekends ( so try to catch it in Saturdays or Sundays ), though it is open all the weekdays . i visited it on April 2018, and i",
          "A nice walk along the bridge and its surroundings. Items from the soviet era mostly. Porcelain, records, military stuff, etc.",
          "you should go for the streets behind since you will find there people painting and handcrafted woolen material. many things are just new and Chinese. you can get much good stuff related to the Soviet era. I liked the experience of visiting. try to bargain.",
          "Unless you are interested in bric a brac this is not worth it. Pretty scrappy stuff. Crammed onto footpath",
          "Personally I'm not interested in buying or collecting antique items and since it's a market full of old stuff, it's not the best place to spend time for me, specially when I'm in vacation. It's definitely a great place for people who are interested in antiques but even if you're",
          "i liked it, if you are interested in old items sort of antiques you will really enjoy it, it also has souvenirs, paintings and woodwork, old book and accessories... its a long market... you get at the end bored because the items get repeated after a while.",
          "I do not know why people rave about this place. It is average with plenty of knock-offs. I guess all the good stuffed was sold years ago. Okay for a visit but that is all. Remember to haggle.",
          "The thing is....there is really nothing of any age left in Georgia to stumble upon! So having traveled around the country - surviving the roads in a hire car - I came back to the flea market with better perspective. There are a few chi chi \"antique\" shops around town selling",
          "We love flea markets, so were looking forward to this one since there are so many reviews of it. We went on the weekend when it is supposed to have more vendors. The sellers are packed kind of tight with not a lot of room to walk in the paths between them. This made browsing",
          "I was in Tiblisi for a conference and had done time for a bit of sightseeing. I ended up going to the market 3 times. Some of the original art is exceptional. We bought 3 paintings, some local ceramic beads, and drinking horns! Yes, that\u2019s correct- drinking horns. Take some cash",
          "Looking for a great souvenir from this memory lane? You wouldn't notice the time as it will keep your eyes busy looking around on the items being sold. Antique items, world war II items, medals from the men who served their country, watches, glasses, horns up to to the simplest",
          "Our last full day in Georgia and we were returning to our Hotel after a Private Tour covering Signagi and Kakheti. Our guide suggested we visit the Dry Bridge and observe the Flea Market in action. Perhaps we were tired after a long day on the road but neither my wife nor I",
          "One of the best markets I ever saw. You can see things before WW2 in very good shape and the products for home are so ANtique its wondeful. I recoomend for everyone to see it.",
          "If you want to see and may buy old and antique stuff then this market is for you. Old rings, watches, glasses, coins,...",
          "If you are interested in Art and antique things its a good place to walk around and enjoy and buy some original souvenirs. I bought an Accordion from here in last day of my trip.",
          "It is local market. Every day open. it is very amazing for watching. from very old toy car to something from word war 2. you can walk from liberty square about 15-20 minutes.but if you are going now be careful, the area is under construction it is a bit hard to go.",
          "Fun flea market that with two advantages: 1. It is open everyday until 6 pm. 2. Easy walk from the city center It is actually a mix of flea market, souvenir stands and art fair. Typical goods on sale includes kilims, USSR memorabilia, LPs, various animal horns and tons of old",
          "The Dry Bridge Flea market in Tbilisi is definitely worth the trip. It's like stepping into a time machine and speeding back to the past! Make sure you choose a bright, sunny day so you can enjoy browsing through this outdoor market. The items displayed will no doubt amaze you",
          "We were expecting the same old, mass produced garbage you find in European markets if I'm honest. We were surprised to find a lot of unique antiques and pieces of memorabilia but most of all the number of artists showcasing original art works. Sure, some were better than others",
          "My family and I are well travelled having to been to over forty countries. We LOVE going to markets. But once you\u2019ve been to a few you start to see the same \u201cauthentic\u201d handicrafts at each one. Or it\u2019s a bunch of modern crap like cell phone covers and selfie sticks. Not this",
          "it s quite a nice place; yet, you should be really careful with your stuff and also you should do your bargain. And dont believe everythin you are told. most of the things they are selling are not really original. Still, you will find sth to your taste, for sure!",
          "You can buy everything you never knew you needed. A lot of Old stuff from Russia and a lot of crap from theese days",
          "Worth a visit more to get an insight into Georgian history and gain a glimpse into what current households contain. To be honest, most of the goods are small items, very old, and probably have more historical value- although plenty of locals were there, and the sellers were",
          "as i titled this review, am here to talk about the art on display here.. amazing endless array of artwork available for sale.. if you are interested in buying art this is the exact place for you.. almost all mediums, various techniques and approaches available at street prices..",
          "We had a great time wandering through the Dry Bridge Market. There are so many things you can find here - from old Abba records to old Soviet kitsch - just about anything is for sale here. I bought several old Soviet war medals for my nephews here as well as some really good",
          "We went there at the second part of the day so probably'y did not see full picture. But there are a lot of old interesting staff you can buy. Also if you walk you can find one place with awesome pictures that man does from old watches and other metal things.",
          "the best place to see and buy stuff from the previous decades, or even centuries.. An amazing place where you can see the legacy of Tbilisi and feel the era of the past times !",
          "The sprawling market (open every day) reminds me of Brick Lane in the East End of London 50 years ago. A mixture of professional sellers who know exactly what they've got and people having a bit of a clear out. But if you like people watching and meeting locals, it is a great",
          "Whenever I travel I have to visit a market looks like Flea Market because they have many old unique stuff. If you are looking for beautiful art pictures or old stamps and currency, then this is the place you have yo go. I loved this market because I got what I was looking for",
          "The flea market is a place to shop for old Russion antique pieces and souvenirs. Its walking distance from the city. We can buy some traditional Georgian handmade stuff like woollen shawls, paintings etc.",
          "Personally, I've always liked going to the Dry Bridge Market. Granted, the prices are geared for tourists and antique hunters, but you can find a fairly large assortment of \"things\" (medals, records, figurines, glassware, etc.). While many of the vendors can speak some English,",
          "I hit the Dry Bridge Flea Market on a Saturday in early December. Based on online reviews, posts and Lonely Planet recommendations, I had high hopes of finding a piece or two of Georgian kitsch. Things start up around 11:00 or 12:00 on opening days. The market itself",
          "This is one of the must do activities when in Tbilisi. It starts from 10 am till 5 pm, but it's good to come around 12 and leave by 4 pm, since sellers set up and pack up by then. Keep in mind that haggling is a must and that you will be able to reduce the price of items usually",
          "Must see! A lovely mess of selling items! People very friendly and helpful. Definitely a very good visit card of the city!",
          "The market is quite large so you will need a couple of hours to nose around. Apart from the obvious tourist items there are many one off pieces which would be hard to get elsewhere. One would have to be prepared to haggle the prices as per car boot sales in England but no one",
          "The flea market in dry bridge is the most nostalgic market that i have been seen till now. Georgian people carry traditional instrument of their homes and some people sell antiques. The prices are reasonable. They sell even transistors of old radios! Don't hesitate to see this",
          "Interesting Flea Market.Take your time to look and search for unique treasures from the Soviet Union era war such as helmets, knives, belts, binoculars, cameras and much more. Yes, mostly used items but worth it if you collect antiques. I bought a bohemian handmade crystal bowl",
          "It is an interesting place to buy some antique or souvenir from Georgia. You can find Art work too and fur. It worth the visit and the review",
          "I really enjoyed the old things at the market, particularly the ancient electronic components and accordians. The jewellery was nice but not amazing as was the craft for sale.",
          "If you have time, then pass by this place. If not, skip this one on your list you can find old stamps, vinyls, porcelains, old currencies, fancy jewelries, paintings, knives, old military related collectibles, (probably faulty) electronics etc there is some construction going",
          "We had read that the Dry Bridge Market was a must do when in Tbilisi. It was the classic flea market pitch \u2013 getting lost for hours amidst junk looking for hidden treasure \u2013 but with the additional Soviet context. It also has history from darker times, according to",
          "I had to look a lot to find something interesting (I like old pictures). There are some Soviet times memorabilia, some items specific to Georgia and so on. But also a lot of trash and kitsch, plus a whole lot of paintings of variable quality. Worth taking a look if you are a",
          "There are many \"fake\" items which I truly believe were brought from Aliexpress as for the other vintage items...well honestly, they are not all that great. If you're lucky then you might find something unique...but that's very rare.",
          "seriously??? so whatever you find in a trash now is a flea market? I don't know...but I didn't see anything interesting apart from old Soviet trash, unusable and total crap... You dont have to plan the day for that, you can pass by from old town to new..",
          "I did not like this flea market! It may look exotic for some tourists but for us, who grew up during the Soviet era with all this junk\u2026 the goodies, the sellers, the vibes \u2013 all remind us the sad Soviet Communist past. We see how some desperate sellers trying to make a few",
          "The dry bridge market is a great place to find original souvenirs, ranging from old magazines, books, and maps to specific Soviet era memorabilia. Don't forget to bring your own water or lemonade during the hot day (as I did not witnessed any cafe or so at this spot). And please",
          "We went to the flea market on our last day in Tibilisi. Being a cold morning we got there while the vendors set about displaying their wares on the pavements. Lots of old Soviet era memorabilia with crockery, cutlery, army knives and possessions from soldiers including",
          "Flea Market Dry Bridge is located next to dry bridge an in street which is parallel by rustaveli ave.and inside mtkoary river and near to museum hotel.there are many chandlers and sell all kind of handmake gifts,souvenir which made on cow horn. and also there are many painting",
          "Even on such a hot day like it was for us, it is nice to go and have a look at all those antiques under the shade of the trees park...",
          "Fair price and multiple sellers. I did buy both antiques and survivors. A nice tip would be to check multiple sellers as the price will vary from one to another. I did find soviet related stuff, hand made gifts and of course antiques and survivors",
          "I went to Georgia on my own for the very first time. Travelling solo has its perks. You can discover the city at your own pace and cover interests of your choice. I had done a lot of research on places to visit in Georgia and the flea market caught my eye. The flea market during",
          "I had heard about the market , and then I went , oh my goodness if you love antiques , old things one man's junk is another man's treasure. I could have spent hours here. I went at 10 am on a Saturday, people were setting up , I think if you came at 11 am onwards would be",
          "The place is packed with history, from antique lamps, typewriters and all kinds of pottery, to WWII hats and antique knives. If you want to buy some unusual gifts, like horns for drinking wine, unique jewelry, old records, or any other thing that comes to your mind, don't miss",
          "The Dry Bridge is home to a famous flea market, where you can find art exhibitions and antique items for sale. Whether you're interested in Soviet memorabilia, handmade jewelry, or personal keepsakes- remember to haggle!",
          "If you're into this kind of stuff - you will love it. A lot of stuff from the soviet regime, lots of retro georgian artifacts, and a lot if plainly junk. It was fun :)",
          "After seeing almost everything in Tbilisi, I did not know what to do with the rest of my time and there I went to the flea market. I visited 2 times, and ended up buying a very nice dagger made out of a coat skin and silver spoons (they are very healthy for you!). Other than",
          "The flea market is a boon for art lovers and antique hunters. But you need to have an eye for detail and a capacity to bargain. It is a pleasure spending hours through the knick knacks. From jewellery to old military badges, from paintings to souveniers, crockery, old",
          "One can spend endless hours here if you are a shopaholic, or just to look around. Genuine, and genuine fake antiques, plus a lot of new stuff is there. Glasses: make sure you feel the rim of each piece to make sure that it is not chipped. We got cheated on this. Russian medals,",

Falling under the umbrella of the Georgian National Museum,  AMG is located near Freedom Square, Tbilisi and possesses around 140,000 items of Georgian, Oriental, Russian, and other European art.\n\n\n== History ==\nA predecessor of the present-day museum, the National Art Gallery, was opened through the efforts of Western-educated young Georgian artists in Tbilisi (Tiflis) on February 1, 1920. Out of it grew the Central Museum of Fine Arts, which was opened in Tbilisi in August 1923. Additional material came from various smaller collections. At the end of 1932, the museum was relocated in the center of the old city on the site of the 13th-century Metekhi church.\n\nIn 1945, following a special agreement between the Soviet and French governments, numerous works of art constituting the National Treasury of Georgia \u2013 manuscripts, metalwork, jewelry, enamels, paintings \u2013 evacuated by the Georgian government-in-exile following the 1921 Red Army invasion, were returned to Tbilisi and added to the museum\u2019s collection. The eminent Georgian art historian Shalva Amiranashvili (after whom the museum is currently named), who was to head the museum for more than thirty years, played an important role in the formation of the collection.\nThe museum became officially known as the Art Museum of Georgia in 1950, the same year that it moved to the building it now occupies. Built in 1838 in neoclassic style, the building housed a theological seminary in the Imperial Russian period.\nThe museum was placed, at the end of 2004, under the joint administration with several other museums, forming the Georgian National Museum.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe spacious rooms of the museum building house the permanent collection, consisting of sections of Georgian, Oriental, Russian, and European art.\nThe most important of the museum\u2019s collections is naturally that of Georgian art, illustrating the development of the national artistic culture over many centuries from ancient times to the present. The Oriental section comes next in its size and importance, and is one of the largest in the post-Soviet countries. Pieces of Persian fine arts, particularly Qajar art, is probably the most significant part of the Oriental collection. It includes several miniatures of Persian court artists \u2013 images of court beauties, and portraits of shahs and noblemen.\nThe museum often holds temporary exhibitions of works from other collections in the country and abroad.\n\n\n== References ==\nArt Museum of Georgia Tbilisi, compiled and introduced by Tamaz Sanikidze (1985), Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad.\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Museum of Georgia",

        "wiki": "Mtskheta (Georgian: \u10db\u10ea\u10ee\u10d4\u10d7\u10d0, romanized: mtskheta [mts\u02b0x\u025bt\u02b0\u0251]) is a city in Mtskheta-Mtianeti province of Georgia. One of the oldest cities of Georgia and its former capital, it is located approximately 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Tbilisi, at the confluence of the Mtkvari and Aragvi rivers. Currently a small provincial capital, for nearly a millennium until the 5th century AD, Mtskheta was a large fortified city, a significant economical and political centre of the Kingdom of Iberia.\nDue to its historical significance and several cultural monuments, the \"Historical Monuments of Mtskheta\" became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. As the birthplace and one of the most vibrant centers of Christianity in Georgia, Mtskheta was declared as the \"Holy City\" by the Georgian Orthodox Church in 2014.In 2016 the Historical Monuments of Mtskheta were placed by UNESCO under Enhanced Protection, a mechanism established by the 1999 Second Protocol to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nArcheological evidences trace human settlement in the area of Mtskheta from 2nd millennium BC to early 1st millennium AD. Numerous burials of the Bronze Age (beginning of the 1st millennium BC) prove that Mtskheta already was a significant settlement at that period.\nAccording to The Georgian Chronicles, Mtskheta was founded by Mtskhetos, the son of Kartlos, eponymous ancestor of the Georgians. The wall around the city was built by Nimrod's ancestor Ardam. By another version, more accepted by historians, Mtskheta was founded by the ancient Meschian tribes in the 5th century BC.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Kingdom of Iberia ===\nMtskheta was the capital of the early Georgian Kingdom of Iberia from the 3rd century BC to the 5th century AD. The chronicles mention that the Kingdom of Iberia and its capital were conquered by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, but certain historians do not accept this. Eventually, the ruler appointed by Alexander ruined the walls of Mtskheta and left only four fortresses, one of them known today as Armazi.\nAncient sources of the 4th-3rd centuries BC mention that Mtskheta had a number of neighbourhoods. Among them, Armazis-tsikhe, Tzitzamuri, Jvari and others. Like other Georgian towns it was divided into the city proper and the citadel.\nBoth the excavations and The Georgian chronicles tell about considerable construction in the Hellenistic period: residential houses, palaces and fortifications. New wall around Mtskheta was built by the first Georgian King Parnavaz in the beginning of the 3rd century BC, and later strengthened by his son Saurmag in the late 3rd - beginning of 2nd century BC. In the end of the 2nd century - beginning of the 1st, the King Parnajom strengthened his relations with Persians and invited Zoroastrian priests to settle in Mtskheta. This probably lead to construction of Zoroastrian temples in the city. Meanwhile, no such archeological evidences exist. Again the walls of Mtskheta were improved during the reign of Bartom in the 1st century BC, and later also by Aderki, often identified with Pharasmanes I. The latter king is associated with appearance of first Christian communities in Kartli and arrival of the Holy Tunic to Mtskheta, brought from Jerusalem by local Jews.\nThe city was strongly fortified at that period. Walls were on both sides of Mtkvari River, and three forts were protecting it. The main citadel, Armazi, on Mount Bagineti was controlling the entrance from south and east, Tsitsamuri, at the base of Mount Jvari from the north, and Sarkine from the west.\nMtskheta was a site of early Christian activity resulting in Christianization of Iberia, where Christianity was proclaimed the state religion in 337. It remains the headquarters of the Georgian Orthodox Church. Around that period Mtskheta was a culturally developed city. A gravestone dated between the end of 4th and beginning and 5th centuries, found in Samtavro necropolis, contains an epitaph in Greek, telling about the main architect and archizograph (artist) of Mtskheta Aurelius Acholis.\nIn the first years after the conversion of Georgia into Christianity, a small wooden church was built in the center of the city, later to become Svetitskhoveli Cathedral. Archeological excavations revealed the remnants of the wooden church within the cathedral. \nBy the 5th century AD the small church was no longer satisfying the growing community of the city, and Vakhtang Gorgasali built a large basilica, the greatest Assumption church in Georgia, Svetitskhoveli, that survived until 11th century. The first katolikos was elected in the 5th century, and his residence was in Svetotskhoveli, in Mtskheta.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nKing Dachi of Iberia (early 6th century AD), who was the successor of Vakhtang I of Iberia, moved the capital from Mtskheta to the more easily defensible Tbilisi according to the will left by his father. Afterwards the importance of Mtskheta began to decline, while that of Tbilisi grew. However, Mtskheta continued as the coronation and burial place for most kings of Georgia until the end of the kingdom in the 19th century.In the 11th century, the earlier basilica of Svetitskhoveli was too small again, and Katolikos Melchizedek I built a new church on top of it.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nThe old  city lies at the confluence of the rivers Mtkvari and Aragvi.\nIn recognition of its role in the Georgian Christian history, Mtskheta was granted the status of a \"Holy City\" by Catholicos-Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia in accordance with the written testament of his 11th-century predecessor Melchizedek I of Georgia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMtskheta is set on a lowland, surrounded by mountains, at the confluence of the two rivers, Mtkvari and Aragvi. The city is approached from the north by the Greater Caucasus and from the south by the Lesser Caucasus mountains.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\nSvetitskhoveli Cathedral (11th century), Samtavro Monastery (4th century) and Jvari Monastery (6th century) in Mtskheta are amongst the most significant monuments of Georgian Christian architecture, and are historically significant in the development of medieval architecture throughout the Caucasus. Of special significance are early inscriptions, which form a valuable reference in the study of the origins of the early Georgian alphabet.. Samtavro necropolis, a burial place north of the monastery, is dated between the middle of the 3rd millennium BC and the 10th century.\n\nIn the outskirts of Mtskheta are the ruins of Armaztsikhe fortress (3rd century BC), the Armaztsikhe acropolis (dating to the late 1st century BC), remains of a \"Pompey's bridge\" (according to legends built by Roman legionnaires of Pompey the Great in the 1st century BC), the fragmentary remains of a royal palace (1st\u20133rd century AD), a nearby tomb of the 1st century AD, and the fortress of Bebris tsikhe (14th century). The Institute of Archaeology, and the garden of Mikheil Mamulashvili are also worthy of note. There is also a monument to sculptor Elena Machabeli.\n\nA mausoleum of rich woman from 1st century AD was recovered near Mtskheta train station. The structure imitates a house with well-processed quadrats and a fronton. The roof was covered with tile. Among the findings inside the mausoleum was a small bronze statue of young man playing flute.\n\n\n== Threats ==\nThe Historical Monuments of Mtskheta were recently placed on UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger, citing \"serious deterioration of the stonework and frescoes\" as the main threat to the site's long-term preservation.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nMtskheta is twinned with:\n\n Leuville-sur-Orge, France (2001)\n Argos, Greece (1991)\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nNotable people from Mtskheta:\n\nTochinoshin Tsuyoshi, (Levan Gorgadze born 1987), sumo wrestler\n\n\n== See also ==\nArmazi\nWorld Heritage Sites in Danger\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAbashidze, Irakli.

Following a medieval Georgian tradition of naming churches after particular places in the Holy Land, the Sioni Cathedral bears the name of Mount Zion at Jerusalem. It is commonly known as the \"Tbilisi Sioni\" to distinguish it from several other churches across Georgia bearing the name Sioni.\nThe Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral is situated in historic Sionis Kucha (Sioni Street) in downtown Tbilisi, with its eastern fa\u00e7ade fronting the right embankment of the Kura River. It was initially built in the 6th and 7th centuries. Since then, it has been destroyed by foreign invaders and reconstructed several times. The current church is based on a 13th-century version with some changes from the 17th to 19th centuries. The Sioni Cathedral was the main Georgian Orthodox Cathedral and the seat of Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia until the Holy Trinity Cathedral was consecrated in 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to medieval Georgian annals, the construction of the original church on this site was initiated by King Vakhtang Gorgasali in the 5th century. A hundred years later, Guaram, the prince of Iberia (Kartli), in c. 575 began building a new structure, which was completed by his successor Adarnase in circa 639. According to legend, both princes were buried in this church, but no trace of their graves has been found. This early church was completely destroyed by Arabs, and was subsequently built de novo.\nThe cathedral was completely rebuilt by King David the Builder in 1112. The basic elements of the existing structure date from this period. It was heavily damaged in 1226, when its dome was ruined on the order of Jalal ad Din Mingburnu. It was subsequently repaired, but damaged again by Timur in 1386 and repaired by King Alexander I. It was again damaged during the Persian invasions in 1522 and in the 17th century.\n\nIn 1657, the Metropolitan of Tbilisi, Elise Saginashvili (died 1670), substantially restored the cupola, vaults, added the southern chapel, paintings and decorations, which is written on southern annex, but the structure was again devastated in 1668, this time by earthquake. The regent of Kartli, batonishvili (prince) Vakhtang, carried out restorations of the cupola and stone plates of the cathedral walls in 1710, as it is carved on the northern wall. Thus, the current tufa facing of the church comes from that period. However, the church was again damaged by the invasion of the Persians in 1795.\nThe cathedral's interior took on a different look between 1850 and 1860, when the Russian artist and general Knyaz Grigory Gagarin (1810\u20131893) composed an interesting series of the murals, though a number of medieval frescoes were lost in the process. A portion of the murals on the western wall were executed by the Georgian artist Levan Tsutskiridze in the 1980s.\nThe stone iconostasis dates to the 1850s, and was also created according G. Gagarin's design. It replaced the wooden iconostasis burned during the Persian invasion in 1795. To the left of the altar is the venerated Grapevine cross which, according to tradition, was forged by Saint Nino, a Cappadocian woman who preached Christianity in the Caucasus in the early 4th century. King Vakhtang III gave the reliquary itself in the early 14th century.\nThe Sioni Cathedral was where the Russian Imperial manifesto on the annexation of Georgia was first published. On April 12, 1802 the Russian commander-in-chief in Georgia, General Karl von Knorring, assembled the Georgian nobles in the Cathedral, which was then surrounded by Russian troops. The nobles were forced to take an oath to the Russian Imperial crown; any who disagreed were taken into custody.Sioni Cathedral remained functional through Soviet times, and was partially renovated between 1980 and 1983.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe Sioni Cathedral is a typical example of medieval Georgian church architecture of an inscribed cross-in-square design with projecting polygonal apses in the east fa\u00e7ade. Main entrance is in the west side. The dome with the tholobate is supported by the altar wall and two freely standing pillars (a more advanced design that appeared after the 11th century). Transition from the pillars to the tholobite is via pointed arches. In addition, the pillars are connected to the northern and southern walls by helm-shaped arches (probably 16th century). The yellow tuff from which the cathedral was built comes from Bolnisi, a town southwest of Tbilisi. The facades are simple, with few decorations, although there are bas-relief carvings of a cross and a chained lion on the western side and an angel and saints on the north. All sixteen windows have carved ornamental frames. Shallow carvings indicate late decoration.\n\nNorth of the cathedral, within the courtyard, is a freestanding three-story bell tower dating from the 1425 reconstruction by King Alexander I. Largely destroyed by the Persian shah Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar in 1795, it was restored to its present condition in 1939. \nAcross the street stands another three-story bell tower; one of the earliest example of Russian Neoclassical architecture in the region.  Complete in 1812, the bell tower was commissioned under Pavel Tsitsianov using money awarded in recognition of his conquest of Ganja for the Russian Empire.\n\nThe murals, painted by G. Gagarin, and iconostasis, also designed by him in 1950s-60s, differed from traditional Georgian tradition.\n\n\n== Burials ==\nThe Sioni Cathedral serves as a burial ground for several notable churchmen, including the 20th-century Catholicoi-Patriarchs of Georgia, and economic and political figure Giorgi Maisashvili: \n\nKyrion II,\nLeonid,\nAmbrose,\nChristophorus III,\nCallistratus,\nMelchizedek III,\nEphraim II,\nPatriarch David V of Georgia\nGiorgi Maisashvili\nPavel Tsitsianov\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTbilisi city government site\nGeorgian Cultural Heritage Information Center",

        "wiki": "Mtatsminda Park is a famous landscaped park located at the top of Mount Mtatsminda overlooking the Georgian capital Tbilisi. The park has carousels, water slides, a roller-coaster, funicular, and a big Ferris Wheel at the edge of the mountain, offering a splendid view over the city.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe park is situated at the 770 metres height, the highest point of Tbilisi, on the area of more than 100 hectares. It is connected to a motorway (Tbilisi-Okrokana Direction) as well as a funicular, built in 1905.\n\nTbilisi Funicular is a ropeway railway connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park. The length of the funicular road is 501 m, the angle of the tunnel is 28-33\u00b0, and the distance between the stations is 0,98 m. The upper station is at 727 m above sea level and the lower station is at 460 m above sea level.Giant Wheel is the highest attraction in Mtatsminda Park: it is 65 m high. The Giant Wheel completes one revolution in 10\u201312 minutes.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park was founded by the Soviet government in the 1930s and was once noted as the 3rd most visited public park in the USSR.\n[In 2001] the late Georgian billionaire Badri Patarkatsishvili along with his wife, Inna Gudavadze, began transforming the park into a 21st-century theme park. Badri owned the park as a charitable project alongside a number of commercial assets in Georgia, included the Rustavi Steel Plant, Borjomi water, and Imedi TV station.\nIn 2007 Patarkatsishvili became a vocal opponent of the National Movement Party and as a result, fell out of favor with President Mikhail Saakashvili. On the 7 November 2007, his assets including Mtatsminda Park and the Imedi TV station were seized by the Government under claims that the company had \u201cviolated numerous times\u201d the terms of the contract and had failed to pay a rental fee. Representatives of Patarkatsishvili immediately rejected this claims, saying that they were \u201cbaseless.\u201dAfter Patarkatsishvili's death at his home in England in February 2008, his widow Inna Gudavadze began international arbitration proceedings against the Government of Georgia, claiming that Mtatsminda Park, along with other Georgian assets, had been unfairly expropriated by the government. On the 29 October 2008, Inna Gudavadze said at a press conference in Tbilisi that Mtatsminda Park, as well as the Imedi TV station were \u201cBadri\u2019s personal projects for Georgia and the Georgian people\" and that she had a \"duty to see that these works are carried on.\u201dIn July 2011, the Patarkatsishvili family reached a settlement with the government that saw Mtatsminda Park returned to Inna and the family in return for them renouncing all claims to the ownership of Imedi TV. Following the fall of President Mikhail Saakashvili, Imedi was also subsequently returned to Inna and her family in October 2012 under the new government.In July 2014, the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Georgia issued a criminal indictment to former President Mikhail Saakashvili and a group of state officials for their role in the illegal expropriation of the Georgian assets owned by the Patarkasishvili family.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMtatsminda Pantheon\nTbilisi National Park\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Cheap, cool funicular that takes you up to the park with a lot of attractions. We went early in the AM before the park opened and it was still worth it for the view and experience.",
          "Few places like this one - you need a hilly city to have such a funicular, that will take you back to 19th century and its technological marvels :) And you children will love it",
          "The funicular was clean, waiting time was about 15minutes and the view was amazing. Definitely worth it to wait for the next train just to get front row seats.",
          "A very scenic ride up to Mtatsminda mountain, one of the must visit places in Tbilisi. This historic cable road was constructed more than 100 years ago, it connects city with Mtatsminda amusement park, which offers best views of the city and many dining options.",

          "The ride up is good but when you get to the top ! Wow !! The view is absolutely fantastic. Don\u2019t miss this if your in Tbilisi it\u2019s the must brilliant city view I e seen. The staff are not great , unhelpful and disinterested really in my opinion but forget about that and go up",
          "There are two restaurants at the top- a snack bar or a full service restaurant. The restaurant is highly recommended. Food was of excellent quality with good service",
          "Nice but rather expensive in particular if you are not travelling alone. Its cheaper but much longer to take a cab.",
          "the waiters were friendly, helpful and knows the menu well. We have been there 4-5 times in 4 months and each time tried different dishes. We loved them all. The desserts are amazing! Wines are also nice. The price is of for this high quality food and service.",
          "My friends and I took a trip on the funicular and had dinner in the beautiful funicular restaurant. The trip was amazing and the service and food inthe restaurant was exceptional. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Tbilisi.",
          "Amazing views of old and modern Tbilisi. It feels great every time I go up there. Proud to be Georgian \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Very expensive tickets for 5 minutes ride....should be 0.5 tetiri but they charge 14 lari for 2 way.",
          "This trip is a must. The views at the top are amazing. We went in the winter. At the top there is a sort of amusement park, with all sorts of attractions. I suspect it may be quite busy in the summer. There is a nice cafe at the top where you can rest a while and the prices",
          "Good experience. Must visit if you are in Tbilisi. Good way to go to the amusement park. Once on the upper station you reach the park. One way charges are 6 GEL per person. Awesome views of the city from the top. Good to decend on the funicular during sunset.",
          "An unique experience of inclined travelling through Funicular towards top of mountain. So many activities & rides for kids there. Amazing view of Tbilisi city from top.",
          "Tried the ponchic. Is great. Actually I keep coming back to the ponchik. Tried the acharuli chachapuri. Ok, a beat salty but tasty. Cooffe was great. Hot chocolate as well.",
          "It was such an Unforgettable and Awesome experience to ride the Funicular Train heading up to a Recreational Place on top of Tbilisi Mountainous City. \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d Overlooking the Picturesque City view of Whole Tbilisi is beyond Wonderful. Morning Tour is recommended to see the great",
          "We actually had hired car and driver for our days in Tbilisi, however we decided to take funicular to go up to Mtatsminda Park. Despite what some people commented that it\u2019s nothing special, my family and I loved it! Tips: Take the lowest seat either to go up or down as it",
          "Take the funicular to go up to the park and enjoy the amazing view 6 GEL per ride per person Well worth the trip!",
          "We went up the funicular ride (undoubtedly the view is great and it\u2019s a fun experience) and while descending I realized that I have forgotten my backpack at the cafeteria. I asked the operator if they could send it down with the next ride or if one of us could go up again and",
          "We were here in September 2019 and this was the first place we headed. The entrance is quite easy to find and a short walk from one of the metro stations. You need a different card for this to the metro, but one card can be used for more than one person - so we bought one card",
          "We have seen this place from our first day and first hour in Georgia. Though we have not explore the place itself, but you can see and feel that the ambiance is amazing!",
          "We spent New Year's Eve in this restaurant! the view from the windows is great! the waiters are positive! the guests are beautiful! dinner is terrible! Wine is very budget friendly! transfer staff funicular rude! a total of $ 130 for this dubious pleasure is too",

          "50m length Funicular takes you to the top of the mountain where you can find list of attractions for small children. But not recommended for young and teenage children. But the city view from there is very nice and you can make a walk around the park.",
          "You've done the cablecar - you really have to do the funicular. Go up one and down the other in your own preference. Great experience with kids.",
          "The funicular is a short walk around the bay of La Concha with Monte Igeldo located at the end. This cog railway with wooden carriages will take you from the lower slopes of the mountain to the fairground at the summit at minimal cost. It is the oldest funicular railway in the",
          "Enjoyable and quick although infrequent departures. Heaters on the seats! Go to the restaurant at the top for Donuts, yum, the fair ground is an added bonus. Good sights over the city especially at night.",
          "Sit, relax and travel up or down. Fresh air on top. Nice view and good to take pictures. Very very nice restaurant when you get there. Recommend a romantic breakie or dinner with local and traditional foods.",
          "Amazing vertical tram is the highlight. Try to hop on to the first cabin from the bottom and you will have amazing views while riding up the hill. And after reaching the top of the hill you will find amusement park with lots of fun activities for Kids.",
          "Easy going, fast and cheap way to get a great view over the city. For kids is there a nice and huge amusement park. Also a Nice ride.",
          "Best view of Tbilisi by far, but scratching head as to why they charge extra to get off half way up before going to the top. Amusement park at the summit, ferris wheel if you want to get even higher. A must do.",
          "take a taxi (Yandex Taxi app) and stand 1st in line so you can get front row and get a beautiful view while going up.",

          "The vertical tram is the highlight which i was seeing first time in my life. once you reach on top it is a treat waiting for your eyes and mind. really appreciate the idea behind the whole concept. Anyone visiting Georgia should never miss this....!!",
          "Really a lot of fun goind from the amazing park down to ground zero. it's also quite inexpensive and a great way to teavel.",
          "It is something that you should try if you have time in Town. Tbilisi is a nice city to explore and I recommend it",
          "What a treat - if you can get front seats then do, although it\u2019s often busy and they do fill up the tram! The views are amazing on the way up and breathtaking at the top. It\u2019s very reasonable and the card you buy for 2 gel can then be used again and added to for the eye at the",
          "14 gel for a return ride lots to see and do when you get to the top. TV station and big ferris \ud83c\udfa1. Go up at night and see the lights of the city",
          "I wanted to go up for the view, which was worth it, but to go on the funicular you must buy a card for 2 lari (NOT the same card as the metro and cable car!!) and charge the card with 3 lari per ride. 8 lari was a bit expensive for the ride, but if you have kids it's a fabulous",
          "Great views over the city and a lovely walk down if you don\u2019t want to go up and back on the funicular. I wasn\u2019t that taken but the offerings at the top but others seemed okay",
          "You have to try the train coming and going from Funicular. Without that, your trip to Tbilisi is incomplete. It's a short 10 minutes train ride but the engineering and the overall fun involved is amazing.",
          "Very clean and reasonable place to have a Georgian bath and message. I recommend you book your own private room for your group.",
          "Good for kid, it is a very clean place the view is amazing and the prices are cheep and the food was good too.",
          "It was a short ride to the top but the view was worth it. Staff not that great in the kiosk but the drivers were fine.",
          "This must be the best value in Baku at only 1AZN for the ride to the top. Great views all over Baku and up close to the Flame Towers. Give yourself enough time to wander round as the viewing area at the top is quite extensive and you might want to go further away from the",
          "The funicular departure point is on the Metekhi Bridge the European traffic Circle. There up you can walk to the Statue of Mother Georgia, The Nariqala fortress and The Botanical Gardens. Excellent views the old town. Easy to walk down but not for people who have hip or knee",
          "We spent an pleasant Sunday walking to the Funicular. A spot of light lunch on the veranda of the restaurant. Neapolitan dessert worth the trip. Visiting the fun park behind and big wheel. Spectacular views over the city of Tbilisi.",
          "i was really looking forward to the views on this but they just let as many people as can squash into each of the 3 carriages so with a limit of 16 people each carriage ( i think) i didnt see a thing going up or down !. up the top is a park and amusement park and the trip is",
          "It was scary at first but it\u2019s all worth it . Was my first time to try funicular we enjoyed the ride and it was very safe.",
          "And full of kids. But quick and does the job once it goes! What more can you say about a train?!!!!!",
          "There is an old tramva from 19s soviet built, and it goes up to the park every 10 minutes. Very interesting tramva as it goes on a 45 degrees angle. It has an stop in the middle to a famous church.",
          "When people were telling,Funicular is a must it was hard to believe. Then you experience it, you will feel the reality",
          "This cable car will take you to Mtezida amusement park. The trouble is that you have quit a climb before you reach it. If you go with children I would suggest taking a cab to the top and the cable car as part of the attraction down.",
          ".. for kids of all ages & very reasonably priced. Visit the church halfway up. Take 0.50 gel coin for the \"loo\"!",
          "Recommended with Pantheon visiting, there are buried famous people of Georgia, church is very beautiful too.",
          "A few years ago this tram and station were completely broken down. The 19th century station is a little gem now and the ride is quick and fun! A set of stairs runs up the side of the tracks...for those with energy and lungs!",
          "On top there's and old amusement park which is quite nice. The Funicular is not that cheap so maybe taking it up and taxi down if you're in a group.",
          "Best time to end it 1-2hrs befr sunset so you can see the view in day light, and return back whn its dark so you can enjoy lights...",
          "It is a very nice view of the city from the restaurant, especially the view by night is amazing. Nice 3 course dinner with a perfect dessert. Good drink selection.",
          "you have to buy another card to travel with this fanicular cuz you cant use your city transportation card. and slon you cant give it back and take your card money too. its a tourist trick!! after you climb there and take a look around if you want to walk till the other hill",
          "Took the tram up the mountain. There are amazing views of the city and surrounding landscape. The tram drops you off in a family oriented theme park with several restaurants and booths fir drinks, ice cream etc. I hiked up the steps to higher elevation. This turned into a dirt",
          "The funicular it's very nice place to visit with friends, business meetings, family. It has great restaurant and great cafe place overlook the Tbilisi city. Also it has game attraction beautiful walking place as well. I suggest everyone to visit you not going to regret.",
          "This was a lovely way to get up the hill and unlock stunning views of the city. It was cheap and efficient. Excellent.",
          "My advice is if you have enough time, then you can come over here to try the funicular up and down, overview the whole city. But for me the view is not that much different than you see over from Narikala, it's quite same actually. But if you have limited time, you really don't",
          "Quite a nice experience, not so expensive, you can enjoy the view on the way. You should try it, at least in one direction.",
          "For us we really enjoyed this tourist attraction. The view up is great and fairly efficient. The card you buy is handy for topping up and using with the games/rides at the top. Which has a range of things to do for little kids. Our little lad who is 5 and a half had a great time",
          "Utterly rubbish experience. Other than the helpful ladies in the ticket offices the rest of the operation seems to be run entirely by halfwit teenagers amusing themselves by seeing how many people they can jam into each carriage. Waited around 15 minutes as more and more people",
          "It is a little pricey for few minutes trip, but the views on the top are beautiful. In terms of activities, there is theme park and restourant. We went for a short walk and panoramic views. Timing was great as it was still bright once we got on top and could see the panorama of",
          "I rode this funicular it was nice, the views are lovely when descending, it was a good way to get to the city after coming with a taxi. Great idea",
          "Great way to get up the hill to Mtatsminda park, but the line is very disorganized and slow. Kids were free, adults 3 lari, and you pay with credit from your Mtatsminda card which costs an extra 2 lari. Also it is up a big hill so don't think you are skipping all the uphill",
          "It realy is a nice and very short ride. Its nice to do it once on your way to the amusment park but if your are short in time I would really recommend taking a taxi straight to the park. I can be a little time consuming to get to the funicular and to stand in the line for it can",
          "It is a quick way to reach the top. The funicular dont run very often, though. But it is worth a visit to have a wonderful view over the whole Tbilisi. There is an amusement park, most for kids, and a nice and calm park to walk around in.",
          "The Funicular was great fun! The views were excellent both on the funicular and once you get to the top.",
          "Quite fun, but if we\u2019d known it would take an hour to get up we wouldn\u2019t have bothered. Fantastic views from top, couple of expensive looking restaurants and then the kids rides. We stayed about half an hour at the top, not wanting the theme park stuff.",
          "I know most countries have different standards to petting zoos for children. This unfortunately makes us a little sad. Would love to see it changed to give the animals more space and just have rabbits, etc and the larger animals especially the monkey should be somewhere else.",
          "We decided to take the funicular to the top of the hill and enjoy the view. The ride and the view were quite nice. After snapping some pictures we discovered the amusement park was slowly opening at 11am. We decided that we had explored enough and would return to the city.",
          "Just try it. It is really fun and very cheap tickets. Take a lot of photo. You can enjoy it soo much",
          "The funicular itself is nothing special, but it brings up to the spectacular view. There is a perfect view restaurant on the top with the fantastic terrace.",
          "It is a very good and effective way to go from the center to the top of the hill where the Mtatsmindas Amusement Park is situated. The price of the ticket is quite cheap.",
          "Was quite a walk to find the entrance by foot but when found just remember that it may still continue going down at night but last shuttle up ends earlier in the evening before 10pm or so. Otherwise excellent and fast way to the top (or down). Worth the view at night and nice",
          "Funicular will cost you 3 lari per person and you need a card for transportation the cost is 2 lari on the upper stop there is a very good restaurant that names funicular on the left side of the stop very tasty deserts and hachapuri",
          "If You are in Tbilisi, just go on funicular. It\u2019s passing Mtatsmindas mountain and entering in the restaurant of the big park Bombora. From where is opening the best sightseeing of Tbilisi",
          "1 person one way is 3 Gel. If you sit on the seat at the front you will see the whole view. Tbilisi view is also very pleasant to watch in the evening. There is lunapark and sightseeing area on the hill. There are also benches and restaurants to sit and watch the landscape.",
          "Enjoyed every second - Opp UP opp Down - dont miss - nice restaurant and cafe on the top and beautiful scenery of the city. Though it was a bit rainy - I enjoyed every moment -0 the price is ridiculously cheap",
          "Great experience with a great view of the city and also very very cheap. The queue was a little chaotic, but apart from that, it was a great touristy experience.",
          "Realised in 1905 like idea and now improuved , the sensation to climb is original. It's a nice place to see and to try. Up it's a big park and a higher place in town.",
          "Standing in the heat waiting for the funicular wasn\u2019t that much of fun. I wonder whether they could operate a bit more efficient.",
          "Anyone visiting Tbilisi should put aside an hour or two to travel up and down on the funicular. It is a great experience and gives you wonderful views over the city and the river. At the top there are restaurants and bars plus the park with its rides and walks.",
          "It was a nice experience going with a train up to the mountain, it was a very beautiful green park and we loved it. The train and veiw is very interesting",
          "The ride was comfortable, and the staff were courteous. We couldn't really see much of a view during the funicular ride, but the view from the top is beautiful! We didn't do much at the park at the top, just walked around a bit, but it does seem like it would be a fun place for",
          "Wonderful aerial views of Tblisi and a great amusement park for kids. Rail card required and useful for attractions at the top.",
          "The waiting and loading of rail cars could be improved but overall something you must do whenever visiting Tbilisi.Superb views day or night and fine dining to boot if that is what you want.",
          "Nothing special, but great to use to come to the mountain. It is worth it, the view, the park, live music...",
          "When we arrived the funicular was broken down. We sat in a nearby Cafe until it was up and running again. Then the queue was quite slow and the funicular itself seemed to sit at each station quite a long time. The funicular itself is modern. Given this is a review of the",
          "An interesting place to spend the day. The weather is excellent cause of it being so high up but you should expect to be thrown off due to the crowded tram that takes you up to the place. As usual the place is packed more during the evenings. If your done from Tbilisi and its",
          "Nice to see. You need to buy a card to go there and put some money in. If at the top you want to date a giant wheel just put 3 Kari per person here as well as you can use this card for payment The park on the top is very soviet but big and you can have a really nice walk",
          "Seemingly vertical ascent on this well established funicular, with modern rolling stock/ trains moving surprisingly swiftly uphill. Very worthwhile as it saves a long detour for a reasonable price.",
          "We took the funicular up to the park and back down and both ways the queue didn\u2019t have much logic as people were all over the place pushing in the line. Slow pace with the funicular drivers, all in all took loads of patience.",
          "From the city center you can go up to the park and restaurant with this \"mountain train\". Very nice experience with a beautiful view over the city when you arrive on the top. And it is also very cheap....",
          "Enjoy, it's actually the start to the amusement park trip. You go up n come down from the fennicular. Road is also there if someone wants to go by car.",
          "It would be my luck, but after going to the top, and checking out the fantastic views of the beautiful city (old and new!) below, when I was ready to go back down, they abruptly closed the cable cars due to an approaching lightning storm, requiring me to walk the 900+ steps back",
          "Experience the Funicular ride vice versa is a great experience. When your on the top, many activities can be done. It's good for family and kids will love this area. There are lots of food to eat, different resto you can choose upon. You may try to visit at night so you can see",
          "I wouldn't say it anything special. It was quite convenient as a transport mean to go down. It was quite packed with the people and we had to wit to start.",
          "It's a pain to buy tickets, you need to have a card that you then put money onto. It's a quick ride to the top and not as scary going down.",
          "seems to be a pattern i have encountered. this is one of the few places where the cards you buy are no refundable. adds to the cost for a tourist. quick way up the hill and good views from the top",
          "Ride the funicular up, see the views, check out the park (great log flume - you will get wet) and walk all the way round to the statue and Fort. Recommend!",
          "Nothing amazing about a Funicular. It is like a subway climbing a hill. There is a kids amusement park on top. Ok for a few hours, it is a bit run down. If you are from the Western world this wont amaze you. There is a decent restaurant at the top with some breeze (nice when",
          "A nice ride from the hillside overlooking Tbilisi, we took a bus up to the very old fashioned Amusement park and this down again...",
          "The funicular is a lovely way to get up the hill to enjoy the views and to get to the amusement park on the top. However be prepared for a long wait at rush hours i.e. evenings until closing time. We were lucky they asked us to go through quickly on the way up as we had a",
          "You nearly walk up a height before you even get to the finicular. Grump guides ensure you pay and a ferried to the top in a modern carnage. The area at the top is worth exploring on a sunny day.",
          "The funicular is a great chance to enjoy breathing views from the top (2nd stop). The ticket buying process is very easy and fast. But the queue to the cabin is so enormous and slow-moving. Especially when the day is hot, it's impossible to wait patiently. Inside the cabin it's",
          "Didn't know that June 1 was some special day for kids so there was a long line going up. However, well worth the wait just for the view of Tbilisi from the top. Glad I didn't buy return tickets because the line was even longer going down. Took a taxi down.",
          "You feel very safe,its is quite new and smooth.The views are brilliant.Lovely park at the top.You have a very short wait to return",
          "Very lovely funicular. Takes you to the theme park. If your not interested in the theme park it's still worth the trip for the amazing views from the top. You need to but a card for 2 gel and then you pay 3 gel to use the funicular each way",
          "I was lucky to get there early and not have to wait in line. The view at Mount Mtatsminda is wonderful. Unlike the very useful metro card which can be used on all transport this card can only be used on this funicular. Just give your card away to some other traveller so people",
          "Nice little funicular to reach an incredible view of Tbilisi. We got there about 9 am and got straight on (Saturday) but when we came down about 2 hours later the lines were starting to form. There is an amusement park at the top and some nice restaurants. You can also walk",
          "Funiculars are always nice, it\u2019s nothing you haven\u2019t seen but its still a good waste of time, if I may be so disrespectful. Definitely take a ride for a nice panoramic view and some cool vacation pics.",
          "If your taking kids then this would be fun, but if it\u2019s great views of Tblisi then this isn\u2019t so great. There are long waits going both up & down , and twe didn\u2019t think the restaurant was that great either, to busy & again long waits for food & drinks . We decided to walk",
          "We were there around 10.30 on a hot Sunday and there was no queue Really annoying that you have to pay 2 Lari for a charge card that's no use soon after. View nothing special especially as track very lined by high trees Annoying also that half way stop counts as a single",
          "The other \"go to the hilltop ride\" is great too. And different. So I did both, on the same day. And that is what you should do I think",
          "The fastest way to reach Mtatsminda park. On regular days, there is a huge line to get into the funicular. So make sure you plan ahead. I waited almost 40min in line to go up. To go down, I took it to the half point station and went down on food thought the forest. Worth it as",
          "We went up the funicular at bout 10.00 am today (Sunday). This was a quiet time with easy access, no queues at all! The price is extremely reasonable and the views are extraordinary. It is a safe and easy ride and well worth doing to get the magnificent views from the top. We",
          "Bought the card/ticket. There are several machines to enter the funicular but no signage, one line appeared to be big groups since there were only 2 of us we joined the other. Several locals were shown in ahead of us, eventually I swiped by card and went through, my other half",
          "Being in Tbilisi you will have to take funicular to go to the upper park. The card for funicular costs 2 lari and the trip costs 3 lari. We stayed in line half an hour.",
          "metro card won't work here, you will be a specific card for that. it is usually busy and crowded, it is way better and faster a cheaper way to get to the top and down.",
          "Use it if you have time and want to try one of the most popular restaurant on the top. Excellent view, especially in the evening. highly recommend to visit once.",
          "Waited in line for 90 minutes. Only takes 3 minutes to get up. Disorganised staff and locals pushed ahead of the line Not worth the wait Park at the top is worth a visit",
          "Very beautiful place from liberty square to funicular taxi will take 5 Gel only than the cable cart cost will be 6 Gel and you will find beautiful city view from height you will fee you are in the sky than a beautiful park you can stay and enjoy specially one who takes kids they",
          "I had the chance to ride this famous cable cart. There is a church in the middle and you can see all of Tbilisi at the too. Really miss this place",
          "The funicular is a modernised way to get up to the Mtatsminda amusement park on the hillside above Tbilisi. You need to get tickets from the ticket office beside the station - multiple tickets can be loaded onto a single plastic card in the same way as the city subway - it is a",
          "We took it as we have been to lazy. As we have been there on a sunny state holiday, we waited about 20 min in line as a lot of locals used the day to get out of the city. Do not think, it will be that packed on a regular day. You have to pay your tickets first (you get little",
          "We waited 40 minutes to board the funicular. Fortunately we allowed ourselves one hour to reach the restaurant for dinner at 7.30pm. On the way back, we waited 35 minutes to board with half the time queueing outside the station. The views were fantastic no doubt and the",
          "The funicular was 3min ride,expensive,with abit rusts.Had to walk a long steep uphill to reach its lower stop.The view on top was on average.The food there was on average too but its price was dear. Pass it if you dont have enough time in Tbilisi",
          "Great trip but go early as many guests will have the same idea. Stop at the top in the restaurant and enjoy view and food",
          "I have been on several funiculars over the years and the one located in Tbilisi is brilliant! It is a beautiful new funicular and it is quite pleasant to ride. There are great views from the top of the hill. Not pass up a trip on the funicular.",
          "At 15 minutes walk from the Freedom Square, for 5 GEL p.p. a short and steep tram ride will bring you (with one intermediate stop) in around 5 minutes to the top of the mountain. Great views over Tbilisi. Try the restaurant at the left side. Great Georgian pastries, pizza and",
          "It's definitely worth a trip up the funicular whilst in Tbilisi, if for nothing else than the views from the top. The park is beautiful and has something for everyone- fairground rides for the family, and various restaurants and bars. The ride up takes less than 5 minutes, and",
          "The funicular is just a way to get on the Mtatsminda park where you can see the whole Tbilisi, so I recommend to do it. Cons: large queues, too tight cabins.",
          "My son had researched this and was keen to try the park at the tops so we took a long walk up to the base station. There was a short queue, but as the park was only partially open, it wasn't long before we could take the modern funicular to the top. It was very clean and",
          "Great view from the top. We spent an afternoon there and walking around the theme park. The theme park is ok but should go to the restaurant and have a coffee or dessert!",
          "Easy access to the park overlooking the city. Great amusement park on top and good restaurants. The train is spacious and fast. It stops half way up the mountain for those who want to stop at the church. Very convenient and a fun experience.",

          "Now this was fun! A train /funicular going up and down a mountain! Fun for the whole family. Heated seats in the cars which is a treat for winter times and a smooth magical and comfortable ride! The best of views and it goes slow enough to enable you to enjoy the wonderful",

          "Visited the place with my kids. March still being cold , the ride was very nice. Even though most of the amusement park was closed due to weather. The funicular ride is interesting for kids. A good thing to do if you are with young kids.",
          "We went up using the cable car, it was midday and unfortunately all park rides were closed. The views of the city were great though, well worth it.",
          "We went up the funicular on our last day after dark. While the lights of the city were nice to see, we would have preferred to go up during the day because the amusement park at the top looked pretty fun, as far as amusement parks go. Great view.",
          "When you visit Tbilisi,leave short time for being here. Climbing the mountain to see all the places you saw. From here it\u2019s possible to see and recognize all the sights. It\u2019s cheap,and short.",
          "We enjoyed our visit. Clean, interesting and pleasantly surprised to find a fairground at the top. It was a quiet day we visited. So managed to get around the park with no queues. Ferris wheel was fun. Kids loved it. Restaurant at the top was fab.",
          "This is a fun park at the top of a cable car which you can take and look over the city. Most things were closed as it was winter but the view was great. We went for morning tea but note there are 2 restaurants and one opens at 12 and the man dining one opens at 1. We went up",

          "There are lots of things to do at the top - there is an amusement park with a big wheel (in case you wanted to go higher!) & plenty of places to eat & drink. The view of the city is amazing - we went late afternoon so managed to see the city view at night too.",
          "The park above is not so attractive but fenicular ride is a must of Tbilisi to do list. Take lowest cabin and seats for best view.",
          "It was my first time to be in a funicular. However, it was a nice experience. The funicular have two stops, you can come down in the first stop to view the old church and graves. And then go back to go further up on the mountain with the funicular where you will reach the",

          "The place must be fantastic during the day and during the warmer months. On a freezing January night it was empty of people. Quite a few of the attractions were open with people attending them and the image was rather sad. However, the view of the city was AMAZING.",
          "A cool experience travelling up the mountain with a stop in the middle of nowhere :-) upper station is renovated, with a great view and restaurant",
          "Visited the furnicular for the first time. People managing the place very helpful. Great view of the city from the top. At the top there is a contact zoo, games and some restaurants. You can even stop in the middle to visit the Mtatsminda Pantheon.",
          "This is a fun thing to do with kids to see the city from an interesting angle. It has a neat cable drawn system that really entertained my 5 year old. It was a great way to get to the pantheon and the park at the top of the mountain. A unique experience!",
          "We love the ambiance especially the trees all around the park. The whole gang will surely enjoy the place and the food in the funicular complex were the best especially the khachapurri and ponchik \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

          "many people have written about the Funicular but I would like to mention an interesting thing I came across while waiting at the station waiting to go up the mountain. On the walls of the staion there was an exibition of pictures to celebrate the 80th year since the opening of",

          "I was not sure what to expect , a funicular, a park, a restaurant. Each of the three wagons can take 16 to 22 people , sitting and standing. The cynical goes between pine trees and climbs above the city clouds. Spectacular view , and indeed if choose to put more money on the",
          "The funicular with its modern cars runs regularly. Our aim was to have dinner in the restaurant at the top to see the city illuminated below. We were earlier than planned so strolled around the amusement park which, on a cold, grey, winter evening was rather quiet. The",
          "Worth a visit though queues can be long. The park at the top is largely closed on winter evenings which is a bit of a shame but there are great views across the city.",
          "We walked our way from Rustaveli avenue to the lower station of Funicular. It\u2019s actually not that hard as long as you have Google maps with you and a lot of energy to do walking. You need to purchase a special card for the Funicular ride. The good thing about it is that for one",
          "Super place but workers on the funicular ticketing and the funicular trip are quite aggressive and unwelcoming.The lady working at the tickets window was lashing out at the tourists who asked her normal questions and she knew English but was answering in Georgian.",
          "This is something a little bit different and is a convenient way of getting to the park at the top. The park itself isn't too exciting but the views out over Tbilisi make the trip up the top worthwhile.",

          "A steep climb up the hill with a good funicular. On the top a very good restaurant. Beautiful surroundings.",
          "Worth the ride but unfortunately the day we visited it was raining. When we arrived at the top everything was closed to our disappointment.",
          "I took a ride on funicular because of good reviews but the ride on the ropeway was more exciting and cheaper. I still enjoyed the scenery on top of the mountain but I would suggest taking the bus uphill because the road was fascinating and worth taking",

          "I Have travelled alone lately in the evening and drivers arrange kind of small party into a cabin, it was really fun. Cool view from the top especially in the night.",
          "Knowing the reason why it was built was actually interesting. I hope to try again soon, the view on top was amazing",
          "This is a must try activity in Georgia , its a funicular ropeway which takes you to the top for the magnificent view of the city.",
          "Very good and is a must but I you have to get a non refundable tourist card. Views from top are impressive and was better than the cable car",
          "The funicular leading up to Mtatsminda Park is a both a convenient means ot transport uphill and an architectural curiosity. It is easily accessible and inexpensive and provides a beautiful way to view and enjoy Tblissi from high above the city. It leads up to Mtatsminda park",
          "Really fab to do this ride,don't go on the weekends as the line up is massive,you can get off half way up to go and see the church on the hill side then hope back on later.",
          "Good place to walk with children, especially during hot summer days. You can try to taste restaurant or face Funicular, but it is quite hard to find place during day and evening time. Best place to watch on city if you are a guest, mostly at evening time at sundown, if snow",
          "the trip up the funicular gives great views of tbilisi, the river, bridges, churches, the presidents palace and the home of Ivanshvili, the oligarch. At the top is a nice restaurant to sit outdoors and enjoy the scenic views",
          "Nice place and view over Tbilisi, its for teenagers rather than my wife and I even though we spent long time walking and as it was like a beautiful garden over the top. There are few food cafes or canteen as well as a five stars restaurant looking at Tbilisi.",
          "A wide range of cakes and deserts. The best was Ponchiki filled with vanilla cream. Also the Idealy cake was really good. \u00c9clair was medium quality, A bit dry. The view is excellent, and a wide area for kids to play. Do not miss the cable car.",
          "If you go to Mtatsminda it is nessesary to try ponchiki - kind of cake in restoraunt on top! It is something...",
          "It is worth a ride on the funicular railway to see the view from the top and to visit the church on the way down. It is very popular with locals at weekends so would suggest midweek if possible.",
          "Your Tbilisi trip would not be complete without a visit to Mtatsminda Park which is at the top of this Funicular Railway. For 8 Gel roundtrip fee, you can go up and down by riding the funicular with fantastic views of th city.",
          "Well worth a go. It is a steep walk from the main street, though, for about 10-15 min, but then you can relax in the Cabin with a great view of the town. The view gets even better when you reach the top. You\u2019ll need a card to charge with the fee; we got ours from the Hotel, but",
          "Fairly new and fast way to climb up the mountain. To ride it, you have to buy an extra card and then you can use this card for various attractions in the fun park. Train ride is around 5-10 minutes, with a brief stop in the middle of the route. We went up there just before the",
          "Good service, although long waiting time for going up due to high load of travellers. The return way was much smoother.",
          "Took the funicular up to the restaurant and it was worth it. A very steep but safe climb up and the views were spectacular of Tbilisi and the restaurant was elegant, reasonably priced and tasty with live music taht was not too loud.",
          "A comparatively long ride with great dynamic views of Tbilisi. Well worth the money, especially if you take the front seat.",
          "The Virgin on top looked like Chrost The Redeemer in Rio from afar, but turned out much smaller and not easy to see from the top of the funicular. You cannot walk down in front and get a proper view as in Rio. The walk down was the best part, strolling through narrow streets",
          "It is a must to be done during your trip in Tbilisi. Enjoy the old railway cab, nowaday modern and confortable to clinb the Mtatsminda hill and to get in the park where you can have a rest, nice walk and if you have babies, a lot of various actrations",
          "Is it really necessary for people being paid to run a tourist operation to be rude to tourists who make a mistake? We, stupidly, thought that you had to change cars at the mid point to go to the top but ended up at the bottom again. The car operator went out of his way to try",
          "Very special view over Tbilisi \u00een The sunset. We Travel up with The tele ca \u00een and going down by foto. A very nice experience",
          "Nicely designed. No doubt that this is one of the tourist attractions and must try. Food station are everywhere and fun place",
          "The ride is interesting the view from the hill is also good.The park ideal for kids.You can enjoy the ride.",
          "Excellent views from each of the 3 carriages, but probably the best at the very front. The cars are clean and well maintained and a great way to get to the top.",
          "We came down the Funicular from the park. It was rather fun ride I must say. Coming down whilst sitting in the front row is quite an experience. We really enjoyed it. The view whilst coming down is spectacular too. It was really really fun ride and recommend people to do it",
          "Do this only if you have never done a funicular ride. The ride lasts just a few minutes and the view is mostly hidden by lush trees .",
          "This is must do in Tbilisi as Funicular itself is a very cool mechanism. Two wagons, one pulling other. But the viewpoint on the top ... mm that's the best view of Tbilisi and that's what you should try at evenings.",
          "There is alot of people on a sunday late morning, but the ride is cheap and very short. The best way to go up to see the views",
          "Great ride to the top. Pls check timing as they were closed from 4 to 6 when we visited and had to wait for an hour outside.",
          "Went twice.. first during the day (went on the big wheel in the park for even greater views 5GEL) and had nice lunch with views at the terrace restaurant. Then was told the best time is to go is evening so went again, this time eating at the Chela restaurant with vast city light",
          "You have to pay 2 Gel for a card,even if you only want to go once.And then you pay for the ticket. Think of it as a means to getting to the top and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Even when the queues are not big outside they appear to fill the cars,including people standing, before",
          "Yup the Funicular is definitely a thing to go in Tbilisi. A bit of queuing to get there but once you are in is very beautiful the way the Tbilisi open up: old building appearing next to modern ones, the river and the mountains that surround the city itself. Definitely you start",
          "The staff is rude and untrained. There are queues, and half of the passengers ride standing. Good view only from the bottom two places when you looking down the mountain. Costs gel 3 per card and gel 2 per ticket. I recommend to go to the Park by bus, which costs 0.5 gel.",
          "They have amazing restaurant on the top... lovely local food. Also, good place to spend time with kids. Very fresh air on the top...",
          "Take the funicular to reach the Mtatsminda Park. At peak times you may need to stand in the car. Views are good.",
          "We wen there by tram. There are two choices. By taxi or tram. Tram is more traditional and very chip. Even you go there by walk , it is not far from down town. Funicular is an old restaurant. Now it is included 4 restaurants. We pick Georgia cuisine. We reserve it from hotel to",
          "Funicular is very good place to relax and have dun. There you can find attractions, cafes, restaurants, bars and etc. Funicular must be seen if you are tourist. I would recommend to sit on the Eye, bexause it has spectacular view.",
          "The funicular is a great way to get from Tbilisi town to the entertainment park on top. However we walked from the fortress to the entertainment park (about 3km, 1,5hours) and to get down, the waiting line was long and if you want to get out to visit the pantheon you have to pay",
          "It is like a park if you go up.. But the journey in the sloppy train is really amazing. The evening time is good as it won't be much hot.Kids can enjoy lot.",
          "It's a fun way to spend the day. We took a taxi to Mtatsminda Park which offers beautiful views and many things to do. Then we took the funicular down. We had to stay standing because it was overloaded with people. Going down just takes a minute.",
          "In my opinion, this place is a must visit if u r in Tbilisi, specially if u r with kids or teenagers. The view from the top is spectacular. There are so many rides that u can enjoy with the kids. The place at the top is very beautiful and worth visiting.",
          "The Funicular is very clean and provides lovely views of Tbilisi. The Funicular requires a card - it costs 2.5 Gel, that you load up with credit in advance and then use for the Funicular and also for the amusements at the top - they do not accept cash on these rides. Note:",
          "It takes very short time and money, so everyone should do it. You get nice views from \"above\" (I went with dark and was really nice) and you can go beside \"mother Georgia\" statue.",
          "Nice to go to the top and check, not that exciting, can skip if you have very little time and had visited other european countries in this type of train.",
          "I wouldn't want to walk to the top. The is a fully refurbished modern funicular that whips you to the top of the mountain and a clean well maintained carriage. Great views of the city.",
          "To get up it is 2GEL for a card and 2GEL per passenger per direction, so up down is 4GEL. Babies ride free. People are most likely to give up their seats to mommies carrying babies. The amusement rides do not take cash, so you will need to charge your card to enjoy them. Also",
          "The ride in the Funicular brings you to the theme park the ride itself however allready is worth the trip",
          "Great location on Mtatsminda mountain the highest place in Tbilisi where is the Tv tower is located. It has a playing park for both adults and children. Up there many restaurants and cafes are available.",
          "If you really like funicular railways then take this ride if not it's pretty pointless. At the top there are some second rate amusements and stands selling a poor selection of food and drink. When we went up the restaurant sign said closed. It was something to do for an hour but",
          "Nice and cheap way to get a view of the city. On the top there is an old amusement park and some restaurants:)",
          "Lovely view the oversee all of Tbilisi. It is worth a visit especial if you have a little walk and meal at the top.",
          "Nice attraction, especially if you\u2019re with children. The view from above is just super. Highly recommended.",
          "The funicalor is a fast and pretty cheap wat to get up the hill to have An amazing view over the city. At night the view is even better with all the lights of the city. On top of the hill there are also two restaurants a normal one and a more high class restaurant. One way price",
          "This is a great way to reach the top of the hill and the restaurant and attractions that are there. A lot faster than the driving alternative",
          "The place was visible from my apartment in Tbilisi so i googled and went there. The 2 way ride was very cheap- about 5 lari. It has a park for kids, a restaurant and few other things at the top. After a long queue, I went up through the tram. The tram stops at one level and",
          "Reasonable kids play park up top but not many suitable for 4-6 year olds. Lots for very young and slightly older, however. Big queues to come back down and no play activities open until 12pm so don\u2019t head up too early.",
          "If you ever visit Tbilisi, this place is must see. You take a very nice tram ride to the Mountain Mtatsminda and the view of the city from the tram is astonishing",
          "Is really worth it! Is very cheap... like 5Gel double way. Try to get in the first compartment so you will enjoy the view better. Sometimes it can take a bit to get into the funicular since they don\u2019t go too fast but still you will enjoy the trip and is the easiest way to get to",
          "The Funicular is a must! it is not too expensive and the view of Tbilisi is amazing. We Recommend the restaurant at the Top with a very nice day-trip around the park",
          "Really nice view especially in the evening. Kids will certainly appreciate to play there. It works till late",
          "Not only that the cost is cheap its the scenery and the vibe that the place has. Reaching the top opens your eyes of how amazing the city is.",
          "This is the fastest and least-expensive way to get a great view of Tbilisi. It\u2019s possible to walk to the lower station from the old city (20-25 minutes). Lunch on the veranda at the restaurant at the top was very good, also with a spectacular view.",
          "The Funicular is a quick and scenic way to reach the Mtatsminda Park. 100% recommended for families hoping to get to the funfair and the viewpoints. A card must be bought for 2 GEL and one person goes for 3 GEL. The card is also the funfair card, which you can recharge.",
          "We took the taxi from station square and paid 25 Lari. On the road was an amazing trip. You literally see the whole Tbilisi from top. By the entrance there was no fee. We did not expect that it was an amusement park. The park opens at 11 am. Funicular opens at 12 noon. Food they",
          "This century old funicular offers access to the amusement park above. The history is interesting and the new trains are comfortable despite the lack of A/C",
          "The ride was enjoyable but overcrowded. There was not any ordered queue and you can't always see outside.",
          "A very entertaining place for kids. A nice experience overall. It has a beautiful view of the surrounding places.",
          "We went up just before sunset, the lines were starting to get a bit long but we didn't wait more than 15 minutes. Price is ok. Views from the top were great, enjoy some wine by the ferris wheel while watching the sunset. Great place to visit if you have kids!",
          "funicular is a good attraction :) this is what it was and will be like many years ago. Funicular will take you to the beautiful park \ud83c\udf32",
          "I strongly recommend Furnicular as a cheap ride 3 lari one way with awesome view! Quick pleasant ride! Much better view during a night!",
          "A good way to reach the theme park up there. U could spend the day upthere with ur kids or date. Nice ride through the mountain. Great view at top.",
          "I did not imagine they would actually hold a global summit there. So I went, not for tourism but for business. I was positively impressed.",
          "At the top of the funicular, there\u2019s a naff little theme park with mini-zoo, bumper cars, Ferris wheel, cafes, and at least one bar that offered \u201cUnlimited Wine for 10 GEL\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s $4! One of the best spots atop the plateau, however, was at the eponymous Funicular restaurant",
          "Absolutely nice way to get up! Buying of tickets was easy, no waiting time! Service was nice and polite. Especially coming down on night was offering great views on Tbilisi.",
          "We spend an evening on the terrasse dining with a view over the city. The waiters are very helpful and the food is the best we've had while being in Georgia",
          "You pretty much have to take the Funicular just for the view alone. Plus you can get a respite of that nasty inner city air with a bit a refreshing oxygen. If you have kids, there's a fun little amusement park amongst the pines. The Funicular restaurant is ok - overpriced and",
          "Great ride. See if you can get a seat facing down as you ride. Going up especially the view just opens up as you go up the mountain. View from the top is excellent",
          "Going up with the funicular is certainly something worth doing. There is a huge park up there with a lot of fun things to do and beautiful sights. Make sure to eat in the Funicular restaurant in the entrance",
          "They take 3 lari for each station to person(there is 3 stations) and additional 2 lari God now why for the card. When I asked why should I pay for the card, everyone told they don't know \ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd28 funny but infuriating. \ud83d\ude0f They over the city is nice but not worth it.",
          "You are paying for the view, but the food and cocktails are of a good standard. Great spot to watch the sunset over Tbilisi.",
          "Most tourist leave city Tbilisi, without visiting this place, i think it must visit place entrance fee is quite cheap like a Dollar , my suggestion is to go to mtastminda by bus or some other transport and come down by funicular",
          "We took the Funicular and had dinner in the restaurant on the top. Beautiful view and the trip took a few minutes only. There was just one problem with the restaurant. My dish arrived before my husband\u2019s so i had finished my dish when he got his. Strange They didn\u2019t figure out",
          "It is a kind of tram that takes you up the mountain where there is Ann amusement park. The park is average but doing this gives you a break from the usual touristy stuff. The view from the top is amazing. Good photo op. The park rides are pretty cheap. Must have at least 2 hours",
          "i travelled there with my family such awesome journey - nice place to visit. once you reach top of the hill big wide park with lot of activities to do for children and adults aswell.",
          "There are three ways to get to the funicular. 1. Funicular Tram / Train (I used this) (3 Lari 1 way) 2. Motorable road (To Mtatsminda Park and walk to funicular) 3. Climb up the steep hill I visited Funicular on the first day of my trip to the Tbilisi. Tbilisi city view from the",
          "Great way how to explore city \"from above\". Buy credit for return ticket and observe city from height. We took a taxi from centre to funicular station. it was around 5 lari. For children, there is some mini zoo and theme park. Do not forget to try georgian wine and \"pizza\" at",
          "great place for friends, family and children. the temperature difference between Tbilisi is 3 , 4 Celsius. and here is a fresh air. so if you have time just go there and have a rest. also there is a perfect restoration. good luck",
          "It\u2019s a must to do when you are in Tbilisi. Very comfortable modern cars that bring you in couple of minutes up the hill. On the way up the views are simply stunning. The funicular has an intermediate stop where you can disembark to visit an old monastery. We didn\u2019t do it,",
          "To get the best views sit in the front coach while going up or down, else you cant really see much. Its a very short ride but quite steep. The interval between rides is 10 - 15 minutes.",
          "nice & well equipped monement ; starting from beka gardens to high mounting ; the rate is very cheap ; 5 min of travelling by cable car ; you can see all city while travelling specially the old town ;",
          "Our family visit this place in summer . Very good landscape and calm area and garden . Big carousel . Good place for family with teenagers .",
          "A very nice attraction in the city of Tbilisi. A great view can be seen during the drive. Reasonable price",
          "The oldest restaurant with the oldest restaurant is the most delicious traditional and European dishes",

          "This is a very new and clean funicular train that operates efficiently and smoothly. The staff is friendly and helpful and the train runs frequently. The restaurant at the top is excellent and reasonably priced. Warning: the amusement park at the top is pretty grim. Many",
          "I don't know if there is alternative way to go there except taxi, i'd preferred to walk ; a kind of climbing. It is a short but sharp trip,nice slope! But the carriage well designed,clean,comfy, not pricey, staff are kind. I took it in the night, the top view of the city is",
          "We enjoyed a tasty lunch, view and breeze in the restaurant at the top of the funicular. We did not our the park at the top station of the funicular.",
          "We arrived at 12.30 to be told the funicular would open at 13.00. It's now 13.30 and it still not open. One guy is just repeating the same phrase in English \"we open at one\" while a colleague is saying in Russian that it's closed for the day. Loads of people milling about and",
          "Nice experience to try on specially at night time, you will see the beauty of Tbilisi and how they glow like gold while you ascend to the Top",
          "Great view. Decent food. Reservation in advance required for the best view. Breathtaking views while claiming up the mountain in the funicukar train.",
          "you can go to funicular by funicular train.on top you can enjoy your food with beautiful view of tbilisi.",
          "Steep hill up from Hero's square but worth the walk (you can taxi it too) great views across Tiblisi so do it at night and plenty of amusements and cafes at the top to hold the interest.",
          "If you want fine dining with a great view, Funicular complex (the second floor) is your place. With live music and good service.food is delicious but it takes time to get served.",
          "We paid for the full house of hop on and off bus on the red, green and blue lines that also included a free boat ride up the river. Nice amusement park for the kids and view was spectacular from the top. We had great food and wine at the restaurant before taking the funicular",
          "Like doing rollercoaster. Bottom to top of mountain by train. Amaizing view. 3 lari per ride. Really cheap",
          "Unexpectedly surprised by how nice the whole area is with the amusement park, the restaurants and walking around was great!",
          "Went up the funicular trainway in the early evening. Excellent views across Tbilisi and it\u2019s surrounds as the sunsets. Had dinner at the Chela Bistro, really good menu and excellent local beers. Nice park to walk around too",
          "We walked up to the funicular through the steep streets near to the entrance. It\u2019s quite a trek in the heat. The pricing was confusing. You need a card which you seem to have no choice but to purchase and then the money is loaded on to it to get through the turn style. Once up",
          "More or less like any other funicular that you may have visited - not worth traveling on as a special trip",
          "I loved this, climbing the mountain with a thing like a train that just climbs the path for you. You can also watch the views or sit for yourself. It was fun, be sure to take the two way ticket, you can also buy one card for two person, and don\u2019t need to pay for two cards. The",
          "Great means of transport to get from the base of the mountain- Old Tbilisi, Sololaki district, to the very top- Mtatsminda Park. The is one more stop in the middle.",
          "The funicular railway is a good way to get views over Tbilisi as the top station is around 770m above sea level. At the top there is the funicular restaurant complex, but also Mtatsminda Park, which is a mix of bars, amusement park and restaurants. From memory it was 3 GEL",
          "When you buy your return ticket what they don\u2019t tell you is that it seems to come with credit, to go on some rides in Mtatsinda Park. At each ride i had to show this card and receive a discount. When we wanted to descend, the unfriendly guy told me i had used all my credit up.",
          "Sunday afternoon and with the sun appearing, our tour guide suggested we take a one way trip on The Funicular up to the top where we had magnificent panoramic views over Tbilisi and surrounds. A really cheap fare of GEL 3/- per person - the Funicular operates 7 days a week",
          "During few minutes journey you can se panorama of Tbilisi. At the top is restaurant in which you can by something to eat or drink. But the best is view from the top.",
          "You will pay 8 gel round trip. It is the best option to arrive at the restaurant complex! Comfortable and fast!",

          "Was there before Tue noon and we were one of very few people (maybe 50 altogether). After we went down with around 3 km walk to Mother of Georgia (don\u2019t buy return ticket and turn right from funicular entry on the top) where you can experience full serenity - there were no",
          "I went up and it was just okay. I did not eat at the restaurant. Sure, the view is good, but there are other, better views of the city. I didn\u2019t go to the amusement park. If I had kids, maybe that would\u2019ve been great.",
          "This is a very convenient and easy way to Mtatsminda Park. Works until late evening though opens late in the morning. You can have a beautiful view from the mountain top as you get there!",
          "At first I was scared because of heights. But when you go at the top of the funicular, you will see a very nice view and will be inside a restaurant.",
          "Cute little ride in the train to the park (3GEL one way). The park at the top has restaurants and bars with traditional food at very good prices - definitely worth a visit. The park should introduce a refund scheme for the cards (2GEL) instead of forcing you to buy something",
          "Nice experience if it's your first time on a fanicular .Great fun for kids on the top with different rides to choose from .View of the city from the top,but not many viewing decks.The resturant at the top seemed popular as many tables were reserved.",
          "We went up in the funicular one evening and watched the sun set over the city. Nice! Good modern facility. Excellent vantage point at the top for photos of the old and new city.",
          "Very nice experience. It's clean and fast and the view is speachless. From the top you can see all Tbilisi.",
          "Funicular is a must I Tblisi . I can only recommend. Spend the afternoon on top of the town. The view from the restaurant is stunning and gives you a good idea of the city structure. (The cakes are also really good)",
          "Of course you can visit this place! The best view of Tbilisi only over there! Park so much relax and good restaurant upstair",
          "For a few lari you can ride to the top and get the best views of Tbilisi. There\u2019s a fun park at the top, but also bars, restaurants etc. It was well worth it and we enjoyed the experience.",
          "Starts with nice ride, amazing view, finger licking food.. what else you look for when you are on leisure.. This place is worth the visit..",
          "Quick way to get from Mtasminda park to the down town. Instructions how to pay are on the photo. It's convenient way to use it. And you can also make photos when going.",
          "The Funicular ride is an experience and reaching the Mtatsminda Park was a journey. The soviet era restaurant is a water-down experience and so is the intimidating TV TOWER. The views of the city and the stepped park are worth looking at.",
          "I mean.. whats to say. Its a tram that goes up hill? If you haven't ever ridden on one of these and you're here sure why not however they do appear to be in most former soviet countries and if we are to compare apples with apples, the Kiev funicular is a little more visually",
          "Lovely outing on a nice day to take the funicular up the hill to Mount Mtatsminda from where you can see the whole of Tbilisi. The view really is fantastic and the ride up very enjoyable, quick and cheap. The park up there is mostly an amusement park for children but still great",
          "Historical station, with very modern and safety train. Not expansive and easyest way to get of Funicular or on Pantheon. Very special place for children and for people who love beautiful views over old city. Enjoy)))",
          "A must see whilst in Tbilisi, the views from the top are fab, the restaurant is great also but take a jacket as it can get cold even on bright sunny days!",
          "This was a wonderful dining and aesthetic experience. The views from the top of the mountain are breathtaking. Once at the restaurant, you must go out on the balcony to have the full experience.",

          "The funicular is a great way to reach Mtasminda Park. The station is located quite far up the hill and therefore quite hard to reach, I would recommend taking a taxi. It is cheaply priced and you can use your orange transport card, if you don't have one you can get one of",
          "This is one of the unique rides you can have in a lifetime. The tram travels on a steep slope taking you from Old Tbilisi to Matsminda park.",

          "If you haven't been on a funicular, then this will certainly interest you. For the best experience, make sure you're in the first or last carriage. Otherwise you'll miss the real reason for taking the trip and making the uphill effort (if you don't cab there) - which of course",
          "The funicular runs uphill to Matsminda Mountain and back with splendid views of the city as you get to the top. Make sure you get the front seat next to the driver to enjoy your ride or else the experience is like travelling in just another tram. Since there is a ride every 15 \u2013",

          "This is the shortest way to reach Mtatsminda Amusement park located at the top of hill. This train is very comfortable, however views are not that great when we traveled as it was cloudy and hazy. Front seat before the driver gives much better views. It is great to know that",
          "From there is the best view on the city. It's better to go there at evening and take a look at the night Tbilisi. There are 3 restaurants up there, so you can order food or drink and enjoy your evening.",
          "If I knew what it was I would have not taken this ride and wasted the little money that I did... it is like a tram which goes up and then brings you down ...nothing much to do up there it could be an excitment for the kids",

          "The funicular in itself looks very good, modern design, lot os history pictures put around in the building, but other than that, it is just a tramway. The park at the top is more for families & people with adventurous theme park wishes.",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a walk to get up to the funicular from liberty square but it is definitely worth it! For about 12 lari we went up to the top (and back down) for a look at the view and we were not disappointed. You can see the whole of Tiblisi from the top and get good pictures of",

          "Funicular is a very important restaurant for georgians. It was one of the biggest highligts in the dark Sovjet Life, In my opinion it still is. The Amazing thing with Funicular is that it has its sections. On the first floor u can have a delicious budget meal and if you want",
          "We just went up the funicular not knowing that it leads up To the amusement park. Remember to take the front row seats for best view!",

          "The ride is steep but very slow. Has two station - one takes you to Mtatminda Pantheon & second one to the Mtstsminda park. The tickets are available at the ground station, costs 15 GEL(if i am remember it right). The ride is just 15 minutes to the top station. there are two",
          "A good means of transport to the Mtatsminda Park. The ride uphill and downhill is scenic but is slow, As I said, Not a ride for thrill seekers! At the top, there is a good amusement park which has good rides, I recommend the \"Ghost House\" and the \" American Rides\".",
          "Im scared of heights but i try to go by Funicular whenever I have the chance. It was a bit scary, but not as steep as the Hong Kong one in Victoria Peak for example. Would do it again anytime!",

          "Worth Every Penny, a fantastic location to see Tiblisi. The Funicular it self is a pleasant experience, but once you reach the top it just takes your breath away. Lovely cafe on the top worth a Coffee and Cake. Standing beneath the TV Tower is impressive. You've got to go",
          "One of the best and fastest ways to get to the Mtatsminda Park. The ride is very pleasant beautiful and scenic. Wish it had less delays between trips and was less crowded, but still worth trying.",
          "It's the most efficient way to the amusement park for the best view of the city...however, the ride itself isn't all that exciting as it'll usually be packed with people and you can't get a great view of the outside for most of the ride...",

        "wiki": "Vakhtang I Gorgasali (Georgian: \u10d5\u10d0\u10ee\u10e2\u10d0\u10dc\u10d2 I \u10d2\u10dd\u10e0\u10d2\u10d0\u10e1\u10d0\u10da\u10d8, Vakht\u2019ang I Gorgasali) (c. 439 or 443 \u2013 502 or 522), of the Chosroid dynasty, was a king of Iberia, natively known as Kartli (eastern Georgia) in the second half of the 5th and first quarter of the 6th century.\nHe led his people, in an ill-fated alliance with the Byzantine Empire, into a lengthy struggle against Sasanian Iranian hegemony, which ended in Vakhtang's defeat and weakening of the kingdom of Iberia. Tradition also ascribes him reorganization of the Georgian Orthodox Church and foundation of Tbilisi, Georgia's modern capital.Dating Vakhtang's reign is problematic. Ivane Javakhishvili assigns to Vakhtang's rule the dates c. 449\u2013502 while Cyril Toumanoff suggests the dates c. 447\u2013522. Furthermore, Toumanoff identifies Vakhtang with the Iberian king Gurgenes known from Procopius' Wars of Justinian.Vakhtang is a subject of the 8th or 11th century vita attributed to Juansher, which intertwines history and legend into an epic narrative, hyperbolizing Vakhtang's personality and biography. This literary work has been a primary source of Vakhtang's image as an example warrior-king and statesman, which has preserved in popular memory to this day.\nHe emerged as one of the most popular figures in Georgia's history already in the Middle Ages and has been canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church as The Holy and Right-Believing King Vakhtang (Georgian: \u10ec\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d8\u10d3\u10db\u10dd\u10ec\u10d0\u10db\u10d4 \u10db\u10d4\u10e4\u10d4 \u10d5\u10d0\u10ee\u10e2\u10d0\u10dc\u10d2\u10d8) and is commemorated on December 13 [O.S. November 30].\n\n\n== Name ==\nAccording to the Life of Vakhtang Gorgasali, the king was given at his birth an Iranian name Varazkhosrovtang, rendered in Georgian as Vakhtang. The name may indeed be derived from Iranian *warx-tang (vahrka-tan\u016b)\u2014\"wolf-bodied\", a possible reflection of the wolf cult in ancient Georgia. Beginning in the late 13th century, numerous Georgian princes and kings took the name Vakhtang. Toumanoff observes that the name Vakhtang has no Classical equivalent and infers that the king's sobriquet Gorgasal\u2014given to Vakhtang because of the shape of the helmet he wore\u2014was rendered by the 6th-century Roman historian Procopius as Gurgenes (Greek: \u0393\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2). Toumanoff's identification of Vakhtang with Gurgenes has not been universally accepted.\n\n\n== Early reign ==\n\nBeyond the Life of Vakhtang Gorgasali (hereinafter LVG), the medieval Georgian sources mention Vakhtang only briefly, yet with respect rarely afforded to the pre-Bagratid Georgian monarchs. Notwithstanding its semi-legendary epic character, the LVG provides many important details, which can be combined with the sources closer to the period in question, such as Lazarus of Parpi and Procopius.Vakhtang is reported by the LVG to have succeeded at the age of 7 his father King Mihrdat (V). His mother, a Christianized Persian Sagdukht, assumed regency in Vakhtang's minority. The author then describes the grave situation in which Iberia was at that time, troubled by the Sassanids' Zoroastrianizing efforts and a ravaging raid by the \"Ossetians\" from the north, this letter being a possible reference to the invasion by the Huns (which may have included Alans) through the Caspian Gates mentioned by Priscus. At the age of 16, Vakhtang is said to have led a victorious retaliatory war against the \"Ossetians\", winning a single combat against the enemy's giant and relieving his sister Mirandukht from captivity. At the age 19, Vakhtang married Balendukht, \"daughter\" of the Great King Hormizd (apparently Hormizd III, r. 457\u2013459). Soon, upon the Great King's request, Vakhtang took part in the campaign in \"India\", probably in Peroz's abortive expedition against the Hephthalites in the 460s, and against the Roman Empire in 472, in which Vakhtang is reported to have gained control of Egrisi (Lazica) and Abkhazia.\n\n\n== Church affairs ==\nReturning to Iberia, Vakhtang took up a series of measures aimed at strengthening the royal authority. Resenting Iranian encroachments on his independence, Vakhtang reversed his political orientation and effected a rapprochement with the Roman government. He married Helena, \"daughter\" (possibly relative) of Emperor Zeno, and received permission from Constantinople to elevate the head of the church of Iberia, the bishop of Mtskheta, to the rank of catholicos, which he sent, together with newly appointed 12 bishops, to be consecrated at Antioch. These rearrangements did not pass smoothly and the king had to overcome opposition, especially in the person of Mikel, the deposed bishop of Mtskheta. Javakhishvili explains this conflict on account of doctrinal differences between the Monophysite Vakhtang and Diophysite Mikel, a presumption supported by Toumanoff, who points out, that the change of prelate and his subordination to Antioch could \"only imply acceptance of Zeno's formulary of faith\", i.e., the moderately Monophysite Henotikon of 482. On his part, another Georgian historian, Simon Janashia, argues that Vakhtang was inclined towards Diophysitism while Mikel adhered to Monophysitism.\n\n\n== War with Iran ==\n\nBy espousing pro-Roman policy, Vakhtang further alienated his nobles, who sought Iranian support against the king's encroachments on their autonomy. In 482, Vakhtang put to death his most influential vassal, Varsken, vitaxa of Gogarene, a convert to Zoroastrianism and a champion of Iran's influence in the Caucasus, who had executed his Christian wife, Shushanik, daughter of the Armenian Mamikonid prince Vardan II and a hero of the earliest surviving piece of Georgian literature. By this act, Vakhtang placed himself in open confrontation with his Iranian suzerain. Vakhtang called on the Armenian princes and the Huns for co-operation. After some hesitation, the Armenians under Vardan's nephew Vahan Mamikonian, joined forces with Vakhtang. The allies were routed and Iberia was ravaged by Iranian punitive expeditions in 483 and 484, forcing Vakhtang into flight to Roman-controlled Lazica (modern western Georgia). After Peroz's death in the war with the Hephthalites in 484, his successor Balash reestablished peace in the Caucasus. Vakhtang was able to resume his reign in Iberia, but did not betray his pro-Roman line.Once the Hundred Years Peace between Iran and Rome collapsed, Kavadh I of the Sassanids summoned Vakhtang as a vassal to join in a new campaign against Rome. Vakhtang refused, provoking an Iranian invasion of his kingdom. Then about 60, he had to spend the last years of his life in war and exile, fruitlessly appealing for the Roman aid. The chronology of this period is confused, but by 518 an Iranian viceroy had been installed at the Iberian town of Tiflis, founded\u2014according to Georgian tradition\u2014by Vakhtang and designated as the country's future capital. According to the LVG, Vakhtang died fighting an Iranian invading army at the hands of his renegade slave who shot him through an armpit defect of his armor. The wounded king was transported to his castle at Ujarma where he died and was interred at the cathedral in Mtskheta. Javakhishvili puts Vakhtang's death at c. 502. If Toumanoff's identification of Procopius\u2019 Gurgenes with Vakhtang is true, the king might have ended his reign in 522 by taking refuge in Lazica, where he possibly died around the same time. Gurgenes\u2019 family members\u2014Peranius, Pacurius, and Phazas\u2014had careers in the Roman military.\n\n\n== Family ==\nAccording to the LVG, Vakhtang was survived by three sons. Dachi, Vakhtang's eldest son by his first marriage to the Iranian princess Balendukht (who died at childbirth), succeeded him as king of Iberia and had to return to Iranian allegiance. Two younger sons by Vakhtang's second marriage to the Roman lady Elene\u2014Leon and Mihrdat\u2014were enfeoffed of the southwestern Iberian provinces of Klarjeti and Javakheti in which Leon's progeny\u2014the Guaramids\u2014traditionally followed pro-Roman orientation. Both these lines survived in Iberia into the 8th century, being succeeded by their energetic cousins of the Bagratid family. Toumanoff has inferred that the Samanazus, a name of the Iberian \"king\" found in John Malala's list of rulers contemporary with Justinian and reported by Theophanes the Confessor and Georgios Kedrenos to have visited Constantinople in 535, might have been a corruption of words meaning \"brother of Dachi\" and so perhaps refers to Mihrdat.\n\n\n== Will of Vakhtang ==\nBefore his death, the wounded King Vakhtang left the will to his son Dachi and to the Georgians:\n\n\u10db\u10d4 \u10d4\u10e1\u10d4 \u10e0\u10d0 \u10ec\u10d0\u10e0\u10d5\u10d0\u10da \u10ec\u10d8\u10dc\u10d0\u10e8\u10d4 \u10e6\u10db\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0 \u10e9\u10d4\u10db\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0, \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d5\u10db\u10d0\u10d3\u10da\u10dd\u10d1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10ee\u10d4\u10da\u10e1\u10d0 \u10db\u10d8\u10e1\u10e1\u10d0, \u10e0\u10d0\u10db\u10d4\u10d7\u10e3 \u10d0\u10e0\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d0\u10db\u10d0\u10d9\u10da\u10dd \u10d2\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10e0\u10e9\u10d4\u10e3\u10da\u10d7\u10d0 \u10ec\u10db\u10d8\u10d3\u10d0\u10d7\u10d0 \u10db\u10d8\u10e1\u10d7\u10d0. \u10d0\u10ec \u10d2\u10d0\u10db\u10ea\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1 \u10d7\u10e5\u10e3\u10d4\u10dc, \u10e0\u10d0\u10d7\u10d0 \u10db\u10e2\u10d9\u10d8\u10ea\u10d4\u10d3 \u10e1\u10d0\u10e0\u10ec\u10db\u10e3\u10dc\u10dd\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0\u10e1\u10d0 \u10d6\u10d4\u10d3\u10d0 \u10e1\u10d3\u10d2\u10d4\u10d7 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d4\u10eb\u10d8\u10d4\u10d1\u10d3\u10d4\u10d7 \u10e5\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10d4\u10e1\u10d7\u10f3\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d8\u10d9\u10e3\u10d3\u10d8\u10da\u10e1\u10d0 \u10e1\u10d0\u10ee\u10d4\u10da\u10e1\u10d0 \u10db\u10d8\u10e1\u10e1\u10d0 \u10d6\u10d4\u10d3\u10d0, \u10e0\u10d0\u10d7\u10d0 \u10ec\u10d0\u10e0\u10e3\u10d5\u10d0\u10da\u10d8 \u10d3\u10d8\u10d3\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0 \u10db\u10dd\u10d8\u10d2\u10dd\u10d7.

A royal oriflamme of the Georgian Bagratids was known as \"Gorgasliani\", i.e., \"of Gorgasali\". It is sometimes supposed to be the earliest model of the current Georgian national flag.\nIn popular memory, his image has acquired a legendary and romantic fa\u00e7ade. Vakhtang is a subject of several folk poems and legends, extolling the king's perceived greatness, enormous physical strength, courage and devoutness to Christianity.Vakhtang has been credited with foundation of several towns, castles, and monasteries across Georgia, including the nation's capital Tbilisi, where a street and a square bear his name, and a 1967 monument by the sculptor Elguja Amashukeli tops the Metekhi cliff. A legend has it that when King Vakhtang was in the forest, his falcon chased a pheasant. The bird fell into a hot water spring and the king and his servants saw the steam come out of the water. Surprised by the abundance of hot water, Vakhtang gave orders to build a city on this site and named it \"Tbilisi\", that is, \"the site of warm springs\".Vakhtang was officially included in the Georgian Orthodox calendar\u2014and a church built in his honor in the city of Rustavi\u2014early in the 1990s, but he had presumably been considered a saint long before that.\nThe Vakhtang Gorgasal Order, created in 1992, is one of the highest military decorations in Georgia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\u10ef\u10e3\u10d0\u10dc\u10e8\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8, \"\u10ea\u10ee\u10dd\u10d5\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0 \u10d5\u10d0\u10ee\u10e2\u10d0\u10dc\u10d2 \u10d2\u10dd\u10e0\u10d2\u10d0\u10e1\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0/\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10da\u10d8\u10e1 \u10ea\u10ee\u10dd\u10d5\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0, \u10e1. \u10e7\u10d0\u10e3\u10ee\u10e9\u10d8\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d2\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10ea. \u10e2.

        "wiki": "Tbilisi (English:  t\u0259-bih-LEE-see, t\u0259-BIL-ih-see; Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 [t\u02b0bilisi] (listen)), in some countries also still known by its pre-1936 international designation, Tiflis ( TIF-lis), is the capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of approximately 1.5 million people. Tbilisi was founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tbilisi was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy, governing both Southern and Northern Caucasus.\nBecause of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global powers. The city's location to this day ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and the Modern structures.\nHistorically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though it is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Its notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from 20 to 32 \u00b0C (68 to 90 \u00b0F) in the summer and 7 to \u22121 \u00b0C (45 to 30 \u00b0F) in the winter.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe name Tbilisi derives from Old Georgian t\u2032bilisi (Asomtavruli: \u10b2\u10a1\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8\u10b1\u10a8, Mkhedruli: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8), and further from tpili (Modern Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8, 'warm', itself from Old Georgian: \u10b2\u10b4\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8 \u1e6dpili). The name T\u2032bili or T\u2032bilisi (literally, 'warm location') was therefore given to the city because of the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs.\nUntil 1936, the name of the city in English and most other languages was Tiflis, while the Georgian name was \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 (Tpilisi).On 17 August 1936, by order of the Soviet leadership, the official Russian names of various cities were changed to more closely match the local language. In addition, the Georgian-language form T\u2032pilisi was modernized on the basis of a proposal by Georgian linguists; the ancient Georgian component \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (tpili, 'warm') was replaced by the newer \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (t\u2032bili). This form was the basis for a new official Russian name (\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438 Tbilisi).  Most other languages have subsequently adopted the new name form, but some languages such as Turkish, Persian, Greek, and German have retained a variation of Tiflis.\nOn 20 September 2006, the Georgian parliament held a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the renaming.\nSome of the traditional names of Tbilisi in other languages of the region have different roots.  The Ossetian name \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a (Kalak) derives from the Georgian word \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e5\u10d8 (kalaki) meaning simply 'town'. Chechen and Ingush names for the city use a form similar to or the same as their names for the country of Georgia (\u0413\u0443\u044c\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0445 G\u00fcr\u01b6ex) as does the historical Kabardian name (\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0436\u044b Kwrd\u017e\u0259), while Abkhaz \u049a\u0430\u0440\u04ad (\u0136ar\u0163) is from the Mingrelian \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8 (Karti).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi since the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age. During the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus. According to legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted variant of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King Vakhtang I of Iberia (r. c. 447/49 \u2013 502/22) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either a hawk or other small birds of prey in the legend). The King's falcon allegedly caught or injured a pheasant during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died from burns. King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and build a city on the location.\nKing Dachi of Iberia (r. 522\u2013534), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved the capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries. From the 6th century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region's strategic location along important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.\n\n\n=== Foreign domination ===\n\nTbilisi's favorable trade location, however, did not necessarily bode well for its survival. Located strategically in the heart of the Caucasus between Europe and Asia, Tbilisi became an object of rivalry among the region's various powers such as the Roman Empire, Parthia, Sassanid Persia, Muslim Arabs, the Byzantine Empire, and the Seljuk Turks. The cultural development of the city was somewhat dependent on who ruled the city at various times, although Tbilisi was fairly cosmopolitan.\nFrom 570\u2013580, the Persians ruled the city until 627, when Tbilisi was sacked by the Byzantine/Khazar armies and later, in 736\u2013738, Arab armies entered the town under Marwan II. After this point, the Arabs established an emirate centered in Tbilisi. In 764, Tbilisi \u2013 still under Arab control \u2013 was once again sacked by the Khazars. In 853, the armies of Arab leader Bugha Al-Turki invaded Tbilisi in order to enforce its return to Abbasid allegiance. The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050. In 1068, the city was once again sacked, only this time by the Seljuk Turks under Sultan Alp Arslan.\n\n\n=== Capital of Georgia ===\nIn 1121, after heavy fighting with the Seljuks, the troops of the King of Georgia David IV of Georgia besieged Tbilisi, which ended in 1122 and as a result David moved his residence from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State and thus inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age. From 12\u201313th centuries, Tbilisi became a regional power with a thriving economy and astonishing cultural output. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and a cultural center not only for Georgia but for the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. During Queen Tamar's reign, Shota Rustaveli worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. This period is often referred to as \"Georgia's Golden Age\" or the Georgian Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Mongol domination and the following period of instability ===\nTbilisi's \"Golden Age\" did not last for more than a century. In 1226, Tbilisi was captured by the Khwarezmian Empire Shah Jalal ad-Din and its defences severely devastated and prone to Mongol armies. In 1236, after suffering crushing defeats to the Mongols, Georgia came under Mongol domination. The nation itself maintained a form of semi-independence and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi was strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols retreated from Georgia and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state once again. An outbreak of the plague struck the city in 1366.\nFrom the late 14th until the end of the 18th century, Tbilisi came under the rule of various foreign invaders once again and on several occasions was completely burnt to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was invaded by the armies of Tamerlane. In 1444, the city was invaded and destroyed by Jahan Shah (the Shah of the town of Tabriz in Persia). From 1477 to 1478 the city was held by the Ak Koyunlu tribesmen of Uzun Hassan.\n\n\n=== Iranian control ===\n\nAs early as the 1510s, Tbilisi (and the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) were made vassal territories of Safavid Iran. In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force. Following the death of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524), king David X of Kartli expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards. With the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of vali. Under the later rules of Teimuraz II and Heraclius II, Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule\u2014but, fearful of the constant threat of invasion, Georgia's rulers sought Russian protection in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Despite this agreement, the city was captured and devastated in 1795 by the Iranian Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who sought to re-establish Iran's traditional sovereignty over the region.\n\n\n=== Russian control ===\n\nIn 1801, the Russian Empire annexed the Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (of which Tbilisi was the capital), later cementing its rule with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, which ended Iranian control of Georgia. Tbilisi became the center of the Tbilisi Governorate (Gubernia). Russian Imperial administrators implemented a new European-style city plan and commissioned new buildings in Western styles. Roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in the Russian Empire, such as Batumi and Poti. By the 1850s, Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and a cultural center. The likes of Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Iakob Gogebashvili, Alexander Griboyedov and many other statesmen, poets and artists all found their home in Tbilisi. The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov, the Romanov family and others. The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day Rustaveli Avenue), on which the Viceroys of the Caucasus established their residence. For much of the 19th century, Tbilisi's largest ethnic group was Armenian, who, at some point, formed 74.3% of the population.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Brief independence ===\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city served as a location of the Transcaucasus interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent Transcaucasian Federation with the capital in Tbilisi. At this time, Tbilisi had roughly the same number of Armenians as Georgians, with Russians being the third largest ethnic group. It was here, in the former Caucasus Vice royal Palace, where the independence of three Transcaucasus nations \u2013 Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2013 was declared on 26 to 28 May 1918. After this, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until 25 February 1921. From 1918 to 1919 the city was also consecutively home to a German and British military headquarters.\nUnder the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian University City after the Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918. On 25 February 1921, the Bolshevist Russian 11th Red Army invaded Tbilisi and after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city, declared Soviet rule.\n\n\n=== Soviet rule ===\n\nIn 1921, the Democratic Republic of Georgia was occupied by the Soviet Bolshevik forces from Russia, and until 1936 Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the Transcaucasian SFSR (which included Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), and afterwards until 1991 as the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized, and it also came to be an important political, social, and cultural centre of the Soviet Union. In 1980 the city housed the first state-sanctioned rock festival in the USSR. As a major tourist destination for both Soviet citizens and foreign visitors, Tbilisi's \"Old Town\" (the neighborhoods within the original city walls) was reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s.Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the 9 March Massacre, in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of Nikita Khrushchev. Peaceful protests occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the April 9 tragedy was a peaceful protest that turned violent.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nSince the break-up of the Soviet Union, Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war, which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-Gamsakhurdia and Opposition forces clashed), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations among various mafia clans and illegal business operators. Even during the Shevardnadze Era (1993\u20132003), crime and corruption became rampant at most levels of society. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the Rose Revolution. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with decreasing crime rates, an improved economy, and a real estate boom. During the 2008 South Ossetia war, the Tbilisi area was hit by multiple Russian air attacks.\nAfter the war, several large-scale projects were started, including a streetcar system, a railway bypass and a relocation of the central station, and new urban highways. In June 2015, a flood killed at least twelve people and caused animals from the city's zoo to be released into the streets.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\nThe status of Tbilisi, as the nation's capital, is defined by the Article 10 in the Constitution of Georgia (1995) and the Law on Georgia's Capital \u2013 Tbilisi (20 February 1998).Tbilisi is governed by the Tbilisi City Assembly (Sakrebulo) and the Tbilisi City Hall (Meria). The City Assembly and mayor are elected once every four years by direct elections. The Mayor of Tbilisi is Kakha Kaladze and the Chairman of the Tbilisi city Assembly is Giorgi Alibegashvili.\n\nAdministratively, the city is divided into raions (districts), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general subdivision of the Soviet Union. Since Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:\n\nMtatsminda District Including Neighborhoods: Mtatsminda, Sololaki, Vera, Kiketi, Kojori, Shindisi, Tsavkikisi, Tabakhmela\nVake District Including Neighborhoods: Vake, Bagebi, Vazha Pshavela Quarters, Nutsubidze Plateau, Tskneti\nSaburtalo District Including Neighborhoods: Delisi, Vedzisi, Vashlijvari, Bakhtrioni, Khiliani, Didi Dighomi, Zurgovana\nKrtsanisi District Including Neighborhoods: Kala, Ortachala, Ponichala\nIsani District Including Neighborhoods: Avlabari, Navtlughi, Metromsheni, Vazisubani, Eighth Legioni\nSamgori District Including Neighborhoods: Varketili, Third Array, Orkhevi, Dampalo, Lilo, Lower Samgori\nChughureti District Including Neighborhoods: Chughureti, Kukia, Svanetisubani\nDidube District Including Neighborhoods: Didube, Didghomi Massive\nNadzaladevi District Including Neighborhoods: Nadzaladevi, Sanzona, Temka, Lotkini, Old Nadzaladevi\nGldani District Including Neighborhoods: Gldani Massive, Avchala, Mukhiani, GldanulaMost of the raions are named after historic quarters of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognise an informal system of smaller historic neighbourhoods. Such neighbourhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the Right Bank and the Left Bank of the Mt'k'vari. The names of the oldest neighbourhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.\nIn pre-Revolution Tiflis, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:\n\nIn the north part of the town, on the left bank of the Kur\u00e1 and to the south of the railway station, stretches the clean German Quarter, formerly occupied by German immigrants from W\u00fcrttemberg (1818). To the south is the Gruzinian or Georgian Quarter (Avlab\u00e1r). On the right bank of the Kur\u00e1 is the Russian Quarter, the seat of the officials and of the larger business firms. This is adjoined on the south by the Armenian and Persian Bazaars.\nAvlabari is considered \"the integral component of the so-called 'old Tbilisi'\" and is the object of planning and cultural heritage preservation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nTbilisi is located in the South Caucasus at 41\u00b0 43' North Latitude and 44\u00b0 47' East Longitude. The city lies in Eastern Georgia on both banks of the Mt'k'vari River. The elevation of the city ranges from 380\u2013770 metres above sea level (1,250\u20132,530 ft) and has the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the Saguramo Range, to the east and south-east by the Iori Plain, to the south and west by various endings (sub-ranges) of the Trialeti Range.\nThe relief of Tbilisi is complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Mt'k'vari River extends for more than 30 km (19 mi) from the Avchala District to River Lochini. The part of the city which lies on the right side of the Mt'k'vari River, on the other hand, is built along the foothills of the Trialeti Range, the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river Mt'k'vari. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on the right bank of the Mt'k'vari River. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.\nTo the north of the city, there is a large reservoir (commonly known as the Tbilisi Sea) fed by irrigation canals.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTbilisi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with considerable continental and semi-arid influences. The city experiences very warm summers and moderately cold winters. Like other regions of Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry period. The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and oceanic (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild microclimate compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.\nThe average annual temperature in Tbilisi is 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). January is the coldest month with an average temperature of 2.3 \u00b0C (36.1 \u00b0F). July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24.9 \u00b0C (76.8 \u00b0F). Daytime high temperatures reach or exceed 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) on an average of 22 days during a typical year.  The absolute minimum recorded temperature is \u221224.4 \u00b0C (\u221211.9 \u00b0F) in January 1883 and the absolute maximum is 42.0 \u00b0C (107.6 \u00b0F) on 17 July 1882. Average annual precipitation is 495.5 mm (19.5 in). May is the wettest month (averaging 77.6 mm (3.1 in) of precipitation) while January is the driest (averaging 18.9 mm (0.7 in) of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15\u201325 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs a multicultural city, Tbilisi is home to more than 100 ethnic groups. Around 89% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azerbaijanis. Along with the above-mentioned groups, Tbilisi is home to other ethnic groups including Ossetians, Abkhazians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Germans, Jews, Estonians, Kurds, Assyrians & Yazidis, and others.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nMore than 95% of the residents of Tbilisi practise some form of Christianity (the most predominant of which is the Georgian Orthodox Church). The Russian Orthodox Church, which is in Full communion with the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church have significant followings as well. A minority of the population (around 1.5%) practises Islam (mainly Shia Islam), while about 0.1% of Tbilisi's population practises Judaism. There is also a Roman Catholic church and the Yazidi Sultan Ezid Temple.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nUp until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding (polo in particular), wrestling, boxing, and marksmanship were the most popular city sports. Influence from the Russian Empire brought more Western sports and activities (billiards, fencing) to Tbilisi.\nThe Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary sports infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 handball arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the Dinamo Arena (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium (24,680 seats). The Sports Palace which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat approximately 11,000 people.\nVere Basketball Hall is a smaller indoor sports arena with a 2,500 seating capacity.\nThe most popular sports in Tbilisi today are football, rugby union, basketball, and wrestling. Also, popular sports include tennis, swimming and water polo. There are several professional football and rugby teams as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. National Basketball Association players Zaza Pachulia and Nikoloz Tskitishvili are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.\nTbilisi's signature football team, Dinamo Tbilisi, has not won a major European championship since the 1980\u20131981 season, when it won the European UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the Euroleague in 1962 but also never repeated any such feat.\nTbilisi will host several Group Phase matches for the EuroBasket 2021 in the country, Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne) and Italy (Milan).\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe large majority of Georgia's media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular Rustavi 2 television channel which gained considerable fame after its coverage of the Rose Revolution. In addition to Rustavi 2, the remaining three out of the four major public television channels of Georgia (including Imedi TV Maestro and the Public Broadcasting Channel) are based in the city. Tbilisi's television market has experienced notable changes since the second half of 2005 when Rustavi 2 successfully bought out the Mze TV company and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation became a shareholder of Imedi Media Holding at the beginning of 2006.\nTbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily 24 Saati (\"24 Hours\"), Rezonansi (\"Resonance\"), Alia, the English-language daily The Messenger, weekly FINANCIAL, Georgia Today, and the English-language weekly The Georgian Times. Out of the city's radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 FM), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.\nRadio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and Byzantine, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Beaux-Arts, Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles. Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801\u20131917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.\nTbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically-inflected Stalinist architecture in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building (\"Imeli\"), now housing the Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi.[2]\n\nTbilisi's postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union's most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi's 1975 Ministry of Roads and the 1984 Wedding Palace. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout \"kamikaze loggia\" overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Soon Tbilisi will have three skyscraper complexes. The Axis Towers, Redix Chavchavadze 64, and the new Ajara Hotel/Business Complex, which is currently under construction, will be the tallest buildings/skyscrapers in the Caucasus.[3]\n\n\n=== Theatre, dance and music ===\n\nThe city has important theatre and music institutions, such as the Tbilisi State Conservatoire, the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre, and the Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre.\n\n\n=== Arts museums and galleries ===\nThe Georgian National Museum gathers several important museums, including the Art Museum of Georgia. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 2012. Two independent contemporary art organisations, Kunsthalle Tbilisi and Open Space of Experimental Art, were founded in 2018.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nTbilisi has important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The Parliament and the government (State Chancellery) buildings of Georgia, the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Sameba Cathedral, the Vorontsov's Palace (also known as the Children's Palace today), the National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia, Tbilisi Circus, The Bridge of Peace, and many state museums are in Tbilisi. During the Soviet times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top four cities in the Soviet Union for the number of museums.\nOut of the city's historic landmarks, the most notable are the Narikala fortress (4th\u201317th century), Anchiskhati Basilica (6th century, built up in the 16th century), Sioni Cathedral (8th century, later rebuilt), and Church of Metekhi, Open Air Museum of Ethnography, Sulfur Bath, and Tbilisi Old City.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nBeyond traditional attractions, Tbilisi has developed burgeoning nightclub culture which started to attract international media attention in the 2010s. The leading clubs such as Bassiani, Mtkvarze, Khidi, and Caf\u00e9 Gallery have featured major international DJs as well as local performers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nWith a GDP at basic prices of 12,147 million Georgian lari (\u20ac4.3 billion) in 2014, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating almost 50 percent of Georgia's GDP. The service sector, including government services, is dominating and contributes 88 percent to GDP. Its GDP per capita of 10,336 Georgian lari (\u20ac3,600) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent. The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi's GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is \u2013 with 22.5 percent \u2013 significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nShota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport is Tbilisi's only international airport, located about 18 kilometres (11 miles) southeast of the city center. Handling 3.16 million passengers in 2017, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the seventeenth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56 million passengers in 11 months of 2018. It is a hub for the National carrier Georgian Airways and a Georgian-Chinese start-up Myway Airlines. \nAs of December 2018, various airlines serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as: London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Vienna, Paris, Doha etc.\nTbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first \"green airport\" in the Caucasus region in 2008.\nNatakhtari Airfield, located 33 km north of Tbilisi in the town of Natakhtari, is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to Batumi, Mestia and Ambrolauri.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tbilisi Metro serves the city with rapid transit subway services. It was the Soviet Union's fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966. The system operates two lines, the Akhmeteli-Varketili Line and the Saburtalo Line. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00 am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.\nThe third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and Tbilisi International Airport with a possible extension to Rustavi, 30 km east of Tbilisi.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nTbilisi had a tram network, since 1883 starting from horse-driven trams and from 25 December 1904 electric tramway. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, electric transport went to a degradation state within the years and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006 together with two trolleybus lines which were left. There are plans to construct a modern tram network.\n\n\n=== Minibus ===\nThe most dominant form of transportation is the minibus. An elaborate minibus system has grown in Tbilisi over the recent years. In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 tetri in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets, they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever he likes.\n\n\n=== Municipal bus ===\nThe second largest form of transportation are the municipal buses which are operated by Tbilisi Transport Company. As of October 2018, 672 buses of various size are servicing the city, majority of them are Ukrainian Bogdan A144 and A092 models along with 143 energy-efficient MAN Lion's City buses. New MAN Lion's City buses were put in service in 2017. Later in 2018, the tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta trucks&Buses won the tender and will be delivering aforementioned order in early 2019. In October 2018, at the Georgian Dream conference, it was announced that all the buses will be changed with new ones by the end of 2019, out of which 90 will be electric. Moreover, Kaladze asserted, that by 2020, Tbilisi will have 200 electric buses and the total number will reach 900.\n\n\n=== Aerial tramways ===\nHistorically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but all of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nSince 2012, Tbilisi has a modern, high-capacity gondola lift which operates between Rike Park and the Narikala fortress; each gondola can carry up to 8 persons. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner Ropeways.Since October 12, 2016, Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects Vake Park with Turtle Lake.\nSince October 2016, another Soviet-era aerial tramway between State University (Maglivi) and University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) is being reconstructed after 13 years of abandonment and is due for opening in April 2018. The original Italian-produced cabins produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti & Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, are being kept as well as the stations.\nDue to mismanagement at the hands of Soviet authorities, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.\n\n\n=== Funicular ===\nTbilisi funicular reopened 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built 1905, connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park, and covering almost 300 m (980 ft) in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower as well as some amusement rides, including a roller-coaster and a ferris wheel.\nThe half-way station of the funicular is just a short way away from Mtatsminda Pantheon, providing easy access to the necropolis.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognised medical education system. The biggest Georgian university is Tbilisi State University which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region. Over 35,000 students are enrolled and the number of faculty and staff (collaborators) is approximately 5,000. Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in Caucasus region \u2013 Tbilisi State Medical University, which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since that university operates as an independent educational institution, TSMU became one of the high-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. There are almost 5000 undergraduate and 203 postgraduate students at the university of whom 10% come from foreign countries.\nGeorgia's main and largest technical university, Georgian Technical University, is in Tbilisi. Georgian Technical University was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by the world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It achieved University status by 1990. The three most popular private higher educational institution in Georgia \u2014The University of Georgia (Tbilisi), Caucasus University, and the Free University of Tbilisi \u2013 are in Tbilisi.\n\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi) is the largest private University in Georgia, with more than 3500 international and local students. It was established in 2005 and soon became a market leader within Georgian educational sector. In 2010, the UG received financing from OPIC (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) for a development of the University's infrastructure and technical equipment. The University of Georgia has various undergraduate and graduate programs and it's the first company in Georgia which offers international certificate programs of the Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Zend technologies and Cisco Academy.\nCaucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB) (established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA). The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through the merger of two higher education schools: European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA). Today Free University comprises three schools \u2014 Business School (ESM), Institute of Asia and Africa and Law School \u2014 delivering academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels. In addition, Free University conducts a wide array of short-term courses and runs several research centers and summer school programs.\nHigher educational institutions in Tbilisi:\n\nTbilisi State University\nIlia State University\nGeorgian Technical University\nTbilisi State Conservatory\nShota Rustaveli Theatre and Film University\nTbilisi State Academy of Arts\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi)\nTbilisi State Medical University\nCaucasus University\nCaucasus International University\nTbilisi Medical Academy\nFree University of Tbilisi\nGrigol Robakidze University \u2013 Alma Mater\nGeorgian American University\nInternational Black Sea University\nGeorgian Institute of Public Affairs\nAgricultural University of Georgia\nInternational School of Economics (ISET)\nThe University of Geomedi\nNew Vision University\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Living in Tbilisi ==\nTbilisi is home to many foreigners. The number of foreigners living and working in Tbilisi has risen in recent years together with the openings of international schools, businesses, expat's communities, and online networks. Tbilisi is a very safe city. Most of the expatriates are living in Vake, Vera, Saburtalo, and Dighomi. A lot of expatriate communities could be found in Tbilisi. Some of them are charging a membership fee.\nIWA, International Women Association  is a non profit organisation founded in 1996 and its members and participants are International and Georgian women.\nExpats in Tbilisi is an Online Support Network founded by UN and EU Staff Spouses in Georgia Country to support expatriates in finding information and all relevant resources in one place.\nInter-nation International\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTbilisi is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAbo Tbileli, the patron saint of Tbilisi\nBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline\nList of Tbilisians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\nPostcard from the Silk Road -(Georgia), TRAVELS \u2013 ESPECIALLY FOR \u201eZNAD WILII\u201d, Leonard Dro\u017cd\u017cewicz, \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d, Vie\u0161oji \u012fstaiga \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d kult\u016bros pl\u0117tros draugija,ISSN 1392-9712 indeks 327956 nr 1 (57) z 2014 r., pp. 87\u201398, (in Polish)http://www.znadwiliiwilno.lt/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Znad-Wilii-57m.pdf\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the City of Tbilisi",

        "wiki": "Tbilisi (English:  t\u0259-bih-LEE-see, t\u0259-BIL-ih-see; Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 [t\u02b0bilisi] (listen)), in some countries also still known by its pre-1936 international designation, Tiflis ( TIF-lis), is the capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of approximately 1.5 million people. Tbilisi was founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tbilisi was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy, governing both Southern and Northern Caucasus.\nBecause of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global powers. The city's location to this day ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and the Modern structures.\nHistorically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though it is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Its notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from 20 to 32 \u00b0C (68 to 90 \u00b0F) in the summer and 7 to \u22121 \u00b0C (45 to 30 \u00b0F) in the winter.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe name Tbilisi derives from Old Georgian t\u2032bilisi (Asomtavruli: \u10b2\u10a1\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8\u10b1\u10a8, Mkhedruli: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8), and further from tpili (Modern Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8, 'warm', itself from Old Georgian: \u10b2\u10b4\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8 \u1e6dpili). The name T\u2032bili or T\u2032bilisi (literally, 'warm location') was therefore given to the city because of the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs.\nUntil 1936, the name of the city in English and most other languages was Tiflis, while the Georgian name was \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 (Tpilisi).On 17 August 1936, by order of the Soviet leadership, the official Russian names of various cities were changed to more closely match the local language. In addition, the Georgian-language form T\u2032pilisi was modernized on the basis of a proposal by Georgian linguists; the ancient Georgian component \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (tpili, 'warm') was replaced by the newer \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (t\u2032bili). This form was the basis for a new official Russian name (\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438 Tbilisi).  Most other languages have subsequently adopted the new name form, but some languages such as Turkish, Persian, Greek, and German have retained a variation of Tiflis.\nOn 20 September 2006, the Georgian parliament held a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the renaming.\nSome of the traditional names of Tbilisi in other languages of the region have different roots.  The Ossetian name \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a (Kalak) derives from the Georgian word \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e5\u10d8 (kalaki) meaning simply 'town'. Chechen and Ingush names for the city use a form similar to or the same as their names for the country of Georgia (\u0413\u0443\u044c\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0445 G\u00fcr\u01b6ex) as does the historical Kabardian name (\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0436\u044b Kwrd\u017e\u0259), while Abkhaz \u049a\u0430\u0440\u04ad (\u0136ar\u0163) is from the Mingrelian \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8 (Karti).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi since the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age. During the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus. According to legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted variant of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King Vakhtang I of Iberia (r. c. 447/49 \u2013 502/22) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either a hawk or other small birds of prey in the legend). The King's falcon allegedly caught or injured a pheasant during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died from burns. King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and build a city on the location.\nKing Dachi of Iberia (r. 522\u2013534), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved the capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries. From the 6th century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region's strategic location along important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.\n\n\n=== Foreign domination ===\n\nTbilisi's favorable trade location, however, did not necessarily bode well for its survival. Located strategically in the heart of the Caucasus between Europe and Asia, Tbilisi became an object of rivalry among the region's various powers such as the Roman Empire, Parthia, Sassanid Persia, Muslim Arabs, the Byzantine Empire, and the Seljuk Turks. The cultural development of the city was somewhat dependent on who ruled the city at various times, although Tbilisi was fairly cosmopolitan.\nFrom 570\u2013580, the Persians ruled the city until 627, when Tbilisi was sacked by the Byzantine/Khazar armies and later, in 736\u2013738, Arab armies entered the town under Marwan II. After this point, the Arabs established an emirate centered in Tbilisi. In 764, Tbilisi \u2013 still under Arab control \u2013 was once again sacked by the Khazars. In 853, the armies of Arab leader Bugha Al-Turki invaded Tbilisi in order to enforce its return to Abbasid allegiance. The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050. In 1068, the city was once again sacked, only this time by the Seljuk Turks under Sultan Alp Arslan.\n\n\n=== Capital of Georgia ===\nIn 1121, after heavy fighting with the Seljuks, the troops of the King of Georgia David IV of Georgia besieged Tbilisi, which ended in 1122 and as a result David moved his residence from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State and thus inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age. From 12\u201313th centuries, Tbilisi became a regional power with a thriving economy and astonishing cultural output. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and a cultural center not only for Georgia but for the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. During Queen Tamar's reign, Shota Rustaveli worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. This period is often referred to as \"Georgia's Golden Age\" or the Georgian Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Mongol domination and the following period of instability ===\nTbilisi's \"Golden Age\" did not last for more than a century. In 1226, Tbilisi was captured by the Khwarezmian Empire Shah Jalal ad-Din and its defences severely devastated and prone to Mongol armies. In 1236, after suffering crushing defeats to the Mongols, Georgia came under Mongol domination. The nation itself maintained a form of semi-independence and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi was strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols retreated from Georgia and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state once again. An outbreak of the plague struck the city in 1366.\nFrom the late 14th until the end of the 18th century, Tbilisi came under the rule of various foreign invaders once again and on several occasions was completely burnt to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was invaded by the armies of Tamerlane. In 1444, the city was invaded and destroyed by Jahan Shah (the Shah of the town of Tabriz in Persia). From 1477 to 1478 the city was held by the Ak Koyunlu tribesmen of Uzun Hassan.\n\n\n=== Iranian control ===\n\nAs early as the 1510s, Tbilisi (and the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) were made vassal territories of Safavid Iran. In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force. Following the death of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524), king David X of Kartli expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards. With the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of vali. Under the later rules of Teimuraz II and Heraclius II, Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule\u2014but, fearful of the constant threat of invasion, Georgia's rulers sought Russian protection in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Despite this agreement, the city was captured and devastated in 1795 by the Iranian Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who sought to re-establish Iran's traditional sovereignty over the region.\n\n\n=== Russian control ===\n\nIn 1801, the Russian Empire annexed the Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (of which Tbilisi was the capital), later cementing its rule with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, which ended Iranian control of Georgia. Tbilisi became the center of the Tbilisi Governorate (Gubernia). Russian Imperial administrators implemented a new European-style city plan and commissioned new buildings in Western styles. Roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in the Russian Empire, such as Batumi and Poti. By the 1850s, Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and a cultural center. The likes of Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Iakob Gogebashvili, Alexander Griboyedov and many other statesmen, poets and artists all found their home in Tbilisi. The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov, the Romanov family and others. The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day Rustaveli Avenue), on which the Viceroys of the Caucasus established their residence. For much of the 19th century, Tbilisi's largest ethnic group was Armenian, who, at some point, formed 74.3% of the population.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Brief independence ===\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city served as a location of the Transcaucasus interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent Transcaucasian Federation with the capital in Tbilisi. At this time, Tbilisi had roughly the same number of Armenians as Georgians, with Russians being the third largest ethnic group. It was here, in the former Caucasus Vice royal Palace, where the independence of three Transcaucasus nations \u2013 Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2013 was declared on 26 to 28 May 1918. After this, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until 25 February 1921. From 1918 to 1919 the city was also consecutively home to a German and British military headquarters.\nUnder the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian University City after the Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918. On 25 February 1921, the Bolshevist Russian 11th Red Army invaded Tbilisi and after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city, declared Soviet rule.\n\n\n=== Soviet rule ===\n\nIn 1921, the Democratic Republic of Georgia was occupied by the Soviet Bolshevik forces from Russia, and until 1936 Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the Transcaucasian SFSR (which included Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), and afterwards until 1991 as the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized, and it also came to be an important political, social, and cultural centre of the Soviet Union. In 1980 the city housed the first state-sanctioned rock festival in the USSR. As a major tourist destination for both Soviet citizens and foreign visitors, Tbilisi's \"Old Town\" (the neighborhoods within the original city walls) was reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s.Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the 9 March Massacre, in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of Nikita Khrushchev. Peaceful protests occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the April 9 tragedy was a peaceful protest that turned violent.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nSince the break-up of the Soviet Union, Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war, which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-Gamsakhurdia and Opposition forces clashed), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations among various mafia clans and illegal business operators. Even during the Shevardnadze Era (1993\u20132003), crime and corruption became rampant at most levels of society. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the Rose Revolution. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with decreasing crime rates, an improved economy, and a real estate boom. During the 2008 South Ossetia war, the Tbilisi area was hit by multiple Russian air attacks.\nAfter the war, several large-scale projects were started, including a streetcar system, a railway bypass and a relocation of the central station, and new urban highways. In June 2015, a flood killed at least twelve people and caused animals from the city's zoo to be released into the streets.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\nThe status of Tbilisi, as the nation's capital, is defined by the Article 10 in the Constitution of Georgia (1995) and the Law on Georgia's Capital \u2013 Tbilisi (20 February 1998).Tbilisi is governed by the Tbilisi City Assembly (Sakrebulo) and the Tbilisi City Hall (Meria). The City Assembly and mayor are elected once every four years by direct elections. The Mayor of Tbilisi is Kakha Kaladze and the Chairman of the Tbilisi city Assembly is Giorgi Alibegashvili.\n\nAdministratively, the city is divided into raions (districts), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general subdivision of the Soviet Union. Since Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:\n\nMtatsminda District Including Neighborhoods: Mtatsminda, Sololaki, Vera, Kiketi, Kojori, Shindisi, Tsavkikisi, Tabakhmela\nVake District Including Neighborhoods: Vake, Bagebi, Vazha Pshavela Quarters, Nutsubidze Plateau, Tskneti\nSaburtalo District Including Neighborhoods: Delisi, Vedzisi, Vashlijvari, Bakhtrioni, Khiliani, Didi Dighomi, Zurgovana\nKrtsanisi District Including Neighborhoods: Kala, Ortachala, Ponichala\nIsani District Including Neighborhoods: Avlabari, Navtlughi, Metromsheni, Vazisubani, Eighth Legioni\nSamgori District Including Neighborhoods: Varketili, Third Array, Orkhevi, Dampalo, Lilo, Lower Samgori\nChughureti District Including Neighborhoods: Chughureti, Kukia, Svanetisubani\nDidube District Including Neighborhoods: Didube, Didghomi Massive\nNadzaladevi District Including Neighborhoods: Nadzaladevi, Sanzona, Temka, Lotkini, Old Nadzaladevi\nGldani District Including Neighborhoods: Gldani Massive, Avchala, Mukhiani, GldanulaMost of the raions are named after historic quarters of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognise an informal system of smaller historic neighbourhoods. Such neighbourhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the Right Bank and the Left Bank of the Mt'k'vari. The names of the oldest neighbourhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.\nIn pre-Revolution Tiflis, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:\n\nIn the north part of the town, on the left bank of the Kur\u00e1 and to the south of the railway station, stretches the clean German Quarter, formerly occupied by German immigrants from W\u00fcrttemberg (1818). To the south is the Gruzinian or Georgian Quarter (Avlab\u00e1r). On the right bank of the Kur\u00e1 is the Russian Quarter, the seat of the officials and of the larger business firms. This is adjoined on the south by the Armenian and Persian Bazaars.\nAvlabari is considered \"the integral component of the so-called 'old Tbilisi'\" and is the object of planning and cultural heritage preservation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nTbilisi is located in the South Caucasus at 41\u00b0 43' North Latitude and 44\u00b0 47' East Longitude. The city lies in Eastern Georgia on both banks of the Mt'k'vari River. The elevation of the city ranges from 380\u2013770 metres above sea level (1,250\u20132,530 ft) and has the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the Saguramo Range, to the east and south-east by the Iori Plain, to the south and west by various endings (sub-ranges) of the Trialeti Range.\nThe relief of Tbilisi is complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Mt'k'vari River extends for more than 30 km (19 mi) from the Avchala District to River Lochini. The part of the city which lies on the right side of the Mt'k'vari River, on the other hand, is built along the foothills of the Trialeti Range, the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river Mt'k'vari. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on the right bank of the Mt'k'vari River. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.\nTo the north of the city, there is a large reservoir (commonly known as the Tbilisi Sea) fed by irrigation canals.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTbilisi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with considerable continental and semi-arid influences. The city experiences very warm summers and moderately cold winters. Like other regions of Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry period. The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and oceanic (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild microclimate compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.\nThe average annual temperature in Tbilisi is 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). January is the coldest month with an average temperature of 2.3 \u00b0C (36.1 \u00b0F). July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24.9 \u00b0C (76.8 \u00b0F). Daytime high temperatures reach or exceed 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) on an average of 22 days during a typical year.  The absolute minimum recorded temperature is \u221224.4 \u00b0C (\u221211.9 \u00b0F) in January 1883 and the absolute maximum is 42.0 \u00b0C (107.6 \u00b0F) on 17 July 1882. Average annual precipitation is 495.5 mm (19.5 in). May is the wettest month (averaging 77.6 mm (3.1 in) of precipitation) while January is the driest (averaging 18.9 mm (0.7 in) of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15\u201325 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs a multicultural city, Tbilisi is home to more than 100 ethnic groups. Around 89% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azerbaijanis. Along with the above-mentioned groups, Tbilisi is home to other ethnic groups including Ossetians, Abkhazians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Germans, Jews, Estonians, Kurds, Assyrians & Yazidis, and others.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nMore than 95% of the residents of Tbilisi practise some form of Christianity (the most predominant of which is the Georgian Orthodox Church). The Russian Orthodox Church, which is in Full communion with the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church have significant followings as well. A minority of the population (around 1.5%) practises Islam (mainly Shia Islam), while about 0.1% of Tbilisi's population practises Judaism. There is also a Roman Catholic church and the Yazidi Sultan Ezid Temple.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nUp until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding (polo in particular), wrestling, boxing, and marksmanship were the most popular city sports. Influence from the Russian Empire brought more Western sports and activities (billiards, fencing) to Tbilisi.\nThe Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary sports infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 handball arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the Dinamo Arena (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium (24,680 seats). The Sports Palace which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat approximately 11,000 people.\nVere Basketball Hall is a smaller indoor sports arena with a 2,500 seating capacity.\nThe most popular sports in Tbilisi today are football, rugby union, basketball, and wrestling. Also, popular sports include tennis, swimming and water polo. There are several professional football and rugby teams as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. National Basketball Association players Zaza Pachulia and Nikoloz Tskitishvili are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.\nTbilisi's signature football team, Dinamo Tbilisi, has not won a major European championship since the 1980\u20131981 season, when it won the European UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the Euroleague in 1962 but also never repeated any such feat.\nTbilisi will host several Group Phase matches for the EuroBasket 2021 in the country, Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne) and Italy (Milan).\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe large majority of Georgia's media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular Rustavi 2 television channel which gained considerable fame after its coverage of the Rose Revolution. In addition to Rustavi 2, the remaining three out of the four major public television channels of Georgia (including Imedi TV Maestro and the Public Broadcasting Channel) are based in the city. Tbilisi's television market has experienced notable changes since the second half of 2005 when Rustavi 2 successfully bought out the Mze TV company and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation became a shareholder of Imedi Media Holding at the beginning of 2006.\nTbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily 24 Saati (\"24 Hours\"), Rezonansi (\"Resonance\"), Alia, the English-language daily The Messenger, weekly FINANCIAL, Georgia Today, and the English-language weekly The Georgian Times. Out of the city's radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 FM), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.\nRadio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and Byzantine, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Beaux-Arts, Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles. Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801\u20131917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.\nTbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically-inflected Stalinist architecture in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building (\"Imeli\"), now housing the Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi.[2]\n\nTbilisi's postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union's most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi's 1975 Ministry of Roads and the 1984 Wedding Palace. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout \"kamikaze loggia\" overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Soon Tbilisi will have three skyscraper complexes. The Axis Towers, Redix Chavchavadze 64, and the new Ajara Hotel/Business Complex, which is currently under construction, will be the tallest buildings/skyscrapers in the Caucasus.[3]\n\n\n=== Theatre, dance and music ===\n\nThe city has important theatre and music institutions, such as the Tbilisi State Conservatoire, the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre, and the Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre.\n\n\n=== Arts museums and galleries ===\nThe Georgian National Museum gathers several important museums, including the Art Museum of Georgia. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 2012. Two independent contemporary art organisations, Kunsthalle Tbilisi and Open Space of Experimental Art, were founded in 2018.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nTbilisi has important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The Parliament and the government (State Chancellery) buildings of Georgia, the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Sameba Cathedral, the Vorontsov's Palace (also known as the Children's Palace today), the National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia, Tbilisi Circus, The Bridge of Peace, and many state museums are in Tbilisi. During the Soviet times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top four cities in the Soviet Union for the number of museums.\nOut of the city's historic landmarks, the most notable are the Narikala fortress (4th\u201317th century), Anchiskhati Basilica (6th century, built up in the 16th century), Sioni Cathedral (8th century, later rebuilt), and Church of Metekhi, Open Air Museum of Ethnography, Sulfur Bath, and Tbilisi Old City.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nBeyond traditional attractions, Tbilisi has developed burgeoning nightclub culture which started to attract international media attention in the 2010s. The leading clubs such as Bassiani, Mtkvarze, Khidi, and Caf\u00e9 Gallery have featured major international DJs as well as local performers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nWith a GDP at basic prices of 12,147 million Georgian lari (\u20ac4.3 billion) in 2014, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating almost 50 percent of Georgia's GDP. The service sector, including government services, is dominating and contributes 88 percent to GDP. Its GDP per capita of 10,336 Georgian lari (\u20ac3,600) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent. The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi's GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is \u2013 with 22.5 percent \u2013 significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nShota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport is Tbilisi's only international airport, located about 18 kilometres (11 miles) southeast of the city center. Handling 3.16 million passengers in 2017, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the seventeenth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56 million passengers in 11 months of 2018. It is a hub for the National carrier Georgian Airways and a Georgian-Chinese start-up Myway Airlines. \nAs of December 2018, various airlines serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as: London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Vienna, Paris, Doha etc.\nTbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first \"green airport\" in the Caucasus region in 2008.\nNatakhtari Airfield, located 33 km north of Tbilisi in the town of Natakhtari, is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to Batumi, Mestia and Ambrolauri.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tbilisi Metro serves the city with rapid transit subway services. It was the Soviet Union's fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966. The system operates two lines, the Akhmeteli-Varketili Line and the Saburtalo Line. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00 am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.\nThe third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and Tbilisi International Airport with a possible extension to Rustavi, 30 km east of Tbilisi.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nTbilisi had a tram network, since 1883 starting from horse-driven trams and from 25 December 1904 electric tramway. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, electric transport went to a degradation state within the years and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006 together with two trolleybus lines which were left. There are plans to construct a modern tram network.\n\n\n=== Minibus ===\nThe most dominant form of transportation is the minibus. An elaborate minibus system has grown in Tbilisi over the recent years. In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 tetri in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets, they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever he likes.\n\n\n=== Municipal bus ===\nThe second largest form of transportation are the municipal buses which are operated by Tbilisi Transport Company. As of October 2018, 672 buses of various size are servicing the city, majority of them are Ukrainian Bogdan A144 and A092 models along with 143 energy-efficient MAN Lion's City buses. New MAN Lion's City buses were put in service in 2017. Later in 2018, the tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta trucks&Buses won the tender and will be delivering aforementioned order in early 2019. In October 2018, at the Georgian Dream conference, it was announced that all the buses will be changed with new ones by the end of 2019, out of which 90 will be electric. Moreover, Kaladze asserted, that by 2020, Tbilisi will have 200 electric buses and the total number will reach 900.\n\n\n=== Aerial tramways ===\nHistorically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but all of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nSince 2012, Tbilisi has a modern, high-capacity gondola lift which operates between Rike Park and the Narikala fortress; each gondola can carry up to 8 persons. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner Ropeways.Since October 12, 2016, Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects Vake Park with Turtle Lake.\nSince October 2016, another Soviet-era aerial tramway between State University (Maglivi) and University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) is being reconstructed after 13 years of abandonment and is due for opening in April 2018. The original Italian-produced cabins produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti & Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, are being kept as well as the stations.\nDue to mismanagement at the hands of Soviet authorities, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.\n\n\n=== Funicular ===\nTbilisi funicular reopened 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built 1905, connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park, and covering almost 300 m (980 ft) in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower as well as some amusement rides, including a roller-coaster and a ferris wheel.\nThe half-way station of the funicular is just a short way away from Mtatsminda Pantheon, providing easy access to the necropolis.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognised medical education system. The biggest Georgian university is Tbilisi State University which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region. Over 35,000 students are enrolled and the number of faculty and staff (collaborators) is approximately 5,000. Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in Caucasus region \u2013 Tbilisi State Medical University, which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since that university operates as an independent educational institution, TSMU became one of the high-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. There are almost 5000 undergraduate and 203 postgraduate students at the university of whom 10% come from foreign countries.\nGeorgia's main and largest technical university, Georgian Technical University, is in Tbilisi. Georgian Technical University was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by the world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It achieved University status by 1990. The three most popular private higher educational institution in Georgia \u2014The University of Georgia (Tbilisi), Caucasus University, and the Free University of Tbilisi \u2013 are in Tbilisi.\n\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi) is the largest private University in Georgia, with more than 3500 international and local students. It was established in 2005 and soon became a market leader within Georgian educational sector. In 2010, the UG received financing from OPIC (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) for a development of the University's infrastructure and technical equipment. The University of Georgia has various undergraduate and graduate programs and it's the first company in Georgia which offers international certificate programs of the Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Zend technologies and Cisco Academy.\nCaucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB) (established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA). The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through the merger of two higher education schools: European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA). Today Free University comprises three schools \u2014 Business School (ESM), Institute of Asia and Africa and Law School \u2014 delivering academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels. In addition, Free University conducts a wide array of short-term courses and runs several research centers and summer school programs.\nHigher educational institutions in Tbilisi:\n\nTbilisi State University\nIlia State University\nGeorgian Technical University\nTbilisi State Conservatory\nShota Rustaveli Theatre and Film University\nTbilisi State Academy of Arts\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi)\nTbilisi State Medical University\nCaucasus University\nCaucasus International University\nTbilisi Medical Academy\nFree University of Tbilisi\nGrigol Robakidze University \u2013 Alma Mater\nGeorgian American University\nInternational Black Sea University\nGeorgian Institute of Public Affairs\nAgricultural University of Georgia\nInternational School of Economics (ISET)\nThe University of Geomedi\nNew Vision University\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Living in Tbilisi ==\nTbilisi is home to many foreigners. The number of foreigners living and working in Tbilisi has risen in recent years together with the openings of international schools, businesses, expat's communities, and online networks. Tbilisi is a very safe city. Most of the expatriates are living in Vake, Vera, Saburtalo, and Dighomi. A lot of expatriate communities could be found in Tbilisi. Some of them are charging a membership fee.\nIWA, International Women Association  is a non profit organisation founded in 1996 and its members and participants are International and Georgian women.\nExpats in Tbilisi is an Online Support Network founded by UN and EU Staff Spouses in Georgia Country to support expatriates in finding information and all relevant resources in one place.\nInter-nation International\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTbilisi is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAbo Tbileli, the patron saint of Tbilisi\nBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline\nList of Tbilisians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\nPostcard from the Silk Road -(Georgia), TRAVELS \u2013 ESPECIALLY FOR \u201eZNAD WILII\u201d, Leonard Dro\u017cd\u017cewicz, \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d, Vie\u0161oji \u012fstaiga \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d kult\u016bros pl\u0117tros draugija,ISSN 1392-9712 indeks 327956 nr 1 (57) z 2014 r., pp. 87\u201398, (in Polish)http://www.znadwiliiwilno.lt/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Znad-Wilii-57m.pdf\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the City of Tbilisi",

It's also known as the Blue Gallery or National Gallery.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the National Art Gallery of Tiblisi is almost a century old. Its foundation is associated with the famous public figure and Georgian artist Dimitri Shevardnadze.The building in which it is located was built in 1888 by the decision of the Russian emperor and the Russian Military Historical Museum. The hall of fame was also founded.The first exhibition of the Art Gallery was held on October 1920. The gallery's exhibition policy was revealed in the early years: exhibitions of Georgian and foreign artists, old and new art periods and what has been valued or entered in the territory of Georgia.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe Gallery between 1880 - 1883 was built for the exhibition of the mibadzvitaa house. The facade of Rustaveli Avenue has a richly decorated decoration and features Baroque art. In the center of the building is the entrance. The two rooms that the gallery has have a glass ceiling and therefore are illuminated with sunlight.\n\n\n== Present ==\nIn 2007, the Tbilisi Art Gallery joined the National Museum of Georgia. A large-scale reconstruction of the gallery building was planned, which resulted in improvements to the central facade and exhibition space.\nThe building has also grown at the expense of gardening. The new exhibition space was created as a result of the reconstruction. The renovated gallery consists of eight rooms, a restoration laboratory, the necessary storage to organize temporary exhibitions, a training space, and an open shop.\nOn November 7, 2006, according to the Decree of the President of Georgia, obtained the category of Monuments of National Importance of Georgia.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Well airconditioned, not very big offers an interesting meeting with Georgian contemporary art. A lot of Pirosmani who is very interesting but some other artists also make impression. Good 40 minutes.",
          "The museum is easily accessible, both on foot and by public transport, and is located in the center of Tbilisi. Inside there is a uniform and pleasant temperature, which is pleasant especially during a warm summer. Surprisingly, there is a great art collection of the Georgian",
          "When you visit Georgia, you need to go and meet its culture, history and art. All this is together in this place. Famous Georgian Artist works will open the colors and soul of modern art.",
          "State museum, place of ART and CULTURE . You will find Georgian real soul. This is the place were every person looks around to see new names beside the old ones.",
          "I wish I'd read other recent TripAdvisor reviews before visiting. Evidently the majority of the museum is closed off for restoration, and as others have noted, there are the works of three 20th century Georgian artists, very primitive in style, on display on the ground floor,",
          "Fine medieval things and a special selection of (pretty ordinary) German painters discovering exotic Georgia in the 19th-c.",
          "currently only two rooms with some 15 painting in each (second floor under repair). Literally three artists represented. AC from the floor near paintings chills down to bones. The pictures are good, true, but it's not enough.",
          "The gallery presented only 3 Georgian painters and a few statues, I really liked on of the three (Lado Gudiashvili) and wanted to purchase a book or poster in the shop downstairs, but they didn't have even a postcard of his paintings! :( Hope the Gallery will improve in the",
          "We were passing the gallery and had time to spare so thought it worth popping in. At GEL 7 it's not too expensive (though less good value than the National Museum down the road - a combined ticket option might be good). We really liked the permanent collection of early to mid",
          "The National Gallery could function as a museum of fine arts while simultaneously supporting its primary mission of promoting contemporary fine arts.",
          "Small gallery, which you can review within 1.5-2 hours, but take the guide, it will be more interesting!",
          "One hour is enough, in my opinion, to visit the Gallery. Two floors. The first for temporary exhibitions, the second with 4 rooms, maybe 70 paintings. Cool. But terrible lack of explanations and diversity that lead to a very quick visit.",
          "There is little to see in this gallery and unfortunately what is is not to our taste. The nationally revered Romanian artist Pirosmani is the main feature (crude folk art to our eyes) but it was interesting to see the throngs of Romanian families there at the weekend obviously",
          "The national gallery, just like 9 museums out of 10 in Tbilisi are bad... Just avoid museums except the national one.",
          "Go just to the second floor, where the paintings of Pirosmani and Gudiashvili, and the sculptures of Kakabadze. That is all the value, but it worth it.",
          "I can't believe this place is completely off the radar for most tourists. Don't get me wrong - I rather enjoy having all three amazing rooms upstairs all to myself. But you're really missing out, folks.",
          "We liked Pirosmani and Gudiashvili exhibitions, as well as learning the history of the place. The modern exhibitions were less our taste, but that's personal. Overall, a great place to visit and spend a rainy day",
          "This place is a must see if you know anything about Niko Pirosmani or are interested in Georgian art.",
          "It may be that this gallery is new, as there wasn't a lot to it. I feel like we saw the works of just 2 famous artists, and then a few modern/contemporary artists and that was all there was to it, so it was a bit disappointing and I'd not take time to go here unless they had",
          "Nothing much to see. The collection was small and hardly impressive, unless you are really into Georgian paintings and sculpture. Not worth the entrance fee.",
          "Didn't go to the treassurery but the rest was very boring. Lot's of staff standing idly yet every picture wasn't hanging straight. Seems not even they take the exhibitions seriously.",
          "There are paintings and sculptures of 5-6 Georgian artist in two beautiful big halls with natural light from above. This was at the time the gallery was built a sensation. I liked the pictures, but I missed any information or biography of this great artists.",
          "There is a limited collection but it is worth to visit. Besides the paintings you can also see the impressive sculpture.",
          "The National Gallery has a world's largest collection of Niko Pirosmani works plus around 10 other Georgian artists from 20th century. The price is 5 GEL for adult. Definitely, a must visit for an art lover.",
          "it is small and great for short visit to get impression on Georgian art. There are temporary & permanent exhibition...",
          "Paintings of Niko Pirosmani are really nice, funny and entertaining to look at, because he was never taught how to paint properly, that's why his paintings look childish and funny in perspective. You can go there and actually have fun, laugh about weirdly drawn bears, giraffes,",
          "Small, but very nice museum. Pirosmani, Kakabadze, their famous pictires impressed. Modern building, good lighting. Agree with previous revues, not very friendly staff. But anyway we enjoyed the visit)",
          "A place full of paintings. With a great light. You will enjoy it if you are an art lover. A good thing is that there are some lockers so you can put your coat and backpack and freely enjoy the gallery",
          "Like most of the gallery's in Tbilisi it's only ok- there's not much to see and the exhibitions are small with not that much in them. Most of the art work is modern and not- in my opinion- that inspiring. It's cheap as chips and enjoyable none the less!",
          "During our visit we enjoyed Temo Gotsatze & Pirosmani \u2013 love this little museum. A ticket price, 5 GEL, is very affordable.",
          "Visit to the gallery will not take a lot of time. There are several small rooms. Each room belongs to individual peinter. A lot Pirosmani's pictutes. But not friendly staff in the ticket ofice.",
          "Who loves Georgia's paint ...Anyone who has written something on Georgia,tverything is stored here...",
          "This is not a large National Art Gallery, but there is enough of a collection of older and contemporary paintings by Georgian painters to make it worth your while. The entrance fee is very affordable.",
          "Nice place, excellent exposition nicely displayed. The only disappointment was overpriced museum store. Their prices exceeded the prices of the finest museum stores of NY.",
          "Excellent place to visit, there you will be able to enjoy painters like Phirosmani, Kakabadze, Nikoladze and etc :)",
          "The gallery is a good opportunity to find a perspective to Georgia. Good intorudtion to Georgian art - right now: Pirosmani, Kakabadze (my favourite), Nikoladze (sculpture) and others. Also there was a centennial photo exhibition about WWI (Nino Jorjadze photo collection). The",
          "Nive space with nice exposition , and this small country can be proud of it. These people have great taste!",
          "This small museum in an older but stately building has some exhibits of Georgian artists. While not the biggest it does an effective job in presenting differing forms of art to the public. There is a small store and what looked like a cafe in the museum. It is located",
          "A must see when visiting Tbilisi. Fabulous temporary exhibitions by Georgian and International contemporary artists beyond the traditional. Great 2nd floor cafe overlooking the park.",
          "The gallery doesn't give you a wow moment, but if you are into arts than you should see the paintings of the georgian artists Nico Pirosmanashvili and Lado Gudiashvili. The temporary photo exhibition by Lado Pochkhua was my biggest pleasant surprise. The photos and the story",
          "Unless you are a great fan of cubism, this museum had not a lot to offer. It was nice to see, but it's not a miss if you didn't go...",
          "Gallery is in a nice location, building itself was also very nice. Unfortunately it was surely lacking in exhibits. There were two floors with just a few paintings and some literature chronicling a painter/filmmakers life. We were in and out in less than an hour and that",
          "This place lets you see the regions big names in art. We also so some old b & wh photos of the old town....it looked old even back in the 1920's ! also be sure to visit the Ileni Akhvlidiani museum on L. Kiacheli st. It is in an old brick/wood apartment building,",
          "The visit at this gallery was a great experience. The paintings of Pirosmani and other Georgian painters were full of humour and humaneness. Don't miss the shop downstairs where you can by books, cards, puzzles etc.",
          "The museum has many paintings by well known masters. It is in a pleasant building and is worth stopping by for an hour or so.",
          "In October, 2012, the national collection of paintings by Pirosmani had been moved here, and are shown along with other 19th and 20th century works. The impeccable galleries, which do allow photography, also had temporary exhibits of more recent artists. A beautiful new back"

        "wiki": "Tbilisi (English:  t\u0259-bih-LEE-see, t\u0259-BIL-ih-see; Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 [t\u02b0bilisi] (listen)), in some countries also still known by its pre-1936 international designation, Tiflis ( TIF-lis), is the capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of approximately 1.5 million people. Tbilisi was founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tbilisi was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy, governing both Southern and Northern Caucasus.\nBecause of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global powers. The city's location to this day ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and the Modern structures.\nHistorically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though it is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Its notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from 20 to 32 \u00b0C (68 to 90 \u00b0F) in the summer and 7 to \u22121 \u00b0C (45 to 30 \u00b0F) in the winter.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe name Tbilisi derives from Old Georgian t\u2032bilisi (Asomtavruli: \u10b2\u10a1\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8\u10b1\u10a8, Mkhedruli: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8), and further from tpili (Modern Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8, 'warm', itself from Old Georgian: \u10b2\u10b4\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8 \u1e6dpili). The name T\u2032bili or T\u2032bilisi (literally, 'warm location') was therefore given to the city because of the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs.\nUntil 1936, the name of the city in English and most other languages was Tiflis, while the Georgian name was \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 (Tpilisi).On 17 August 1936, by order of the Soviet leadership, the official Russian names of various cities were changed to more closely match the local language. In addition, the Georgian-language form T\u2032pilisi was modernized on the basis of a proposal by Georgian linguists; the ancient Georgian component \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (tpili, 'warm') was replaced by the newer \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (t\u2032bili). This form was the basis for a new official Russian name (\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438 Tbilisi).  Most other languages have subsequently adopted the new name form, but some languages such as Turkish, Persian, Greek, and German have retained a variation of Tiflis.\nOn 20 September 2006, the Georgian parliament held a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the renaming.\nSome of the traditional names of Tbilisi in other languages of the region have different roots.  The Ossetian name \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a (Kalak) derives from the Georgian word \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e5\u10d8 (kalaki) meaning simply 'town'. Chechen and Ingush names for the city use a form similar to or the same as their names for the country of Georgia (\u0413\u0443\u044c\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0445 G\u00fcr\u01b6ex) as does the historical Kabardian name (\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0436\u044b Kwrd\u017e\u0259), while Abkhaz \u049a\u0430\u0440\u04ad (\u0136ar\u0163) is from the Mingrelian \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8 (Karti).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi since the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age. During the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus. According to legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted variant of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King Vakhtang I of Iberia (r. c. 447/49 \u2013 502/22) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either a hawk or other small birds of prey in the legend). The King's falcon allegedly caught or injured a pheasant during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died from burns. King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and build a city on the location.\nKing Dachi of Iberia (r. 522\u2013534), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved the capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries. From the 6th century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region's strategic location along important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.\n\n\n=== Foreign domination ===\n\nTbilisi's favorable trade location, however, did not necessarily bode well for its survival. Located strategically in the heart of the Caucasus between Europe and Asia, Tbilisi became an object of rivalry among the region's various powers such as the Roman Empire, Parthia, Sassanid Persia, Muslim Arabs, the Byzantine Empire, and the Seljuk Turks. The cultural development of the city was somewhat dependent on who ruled the city at various times, although Tbilisi was fairly cosmopolitan.\nFrom 570\u2013580, the Persians ruled the city until 627, when Tbilisi was sacked by the Byzantine/Khazar armies and later, in 736\u2013738, Arab armies entered the town under Marwan II. After this point, the Arabs established an emirate centered in Tbilisi. In 764, Tbilisi \u2013 still under Arab control \u2013 was once again sacked by the Khazars. In 853, the armies of Arab leader Bugha Al-Turki invaded Tbilisi in order to enforce its return to Abbasid allegiance. The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050. In 1068, the city was once again sacked, only this time by the Seljuk Turks under Sultan Alp Arslan.\n\n\n=== Capital of Georgia ===\nIn 1121, after heavy fighting with the Seljuks, the troops of the King of Georgia David IV of Georgia besieged Tbilisi, which ended in 1122 and as a result David moved his residence from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State and thus inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age. From 12\u201313th centuries, Tbilisi became a regional power with a thriving economy and astonishing cultural output. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and a cultural center not only for Georgia but for the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. During Queen Tamar's reign, Shota Rustaveli worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. This period is often referred to as \"Georgia's Golden Age\" or the Georgian Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Mongol domination and the following period of instability ===\nTbilisi's \"Golden Age\" did not last for more than a century. In 1226, Tbilisi was captured by the Khwarezmian Empire Shah Jalal ad-Din and its defences severely devastated and prone to Mongol armies. In 1236, after suffering crushing defeats to the Mongols, Georgia came under Mongol domination. The nation itself maintained a form of semi-independence and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi was strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols retreated from Georgia and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state once again. An outbreak of the plague struck the city in 1366.\nFrom the late 14th until the end of the 18th century, Tbilisi came under the rule of various foreign invaders once again and on several occasions was completely burnt to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was invaded by the armies of Tamerlane. In 1444, the city was invaded and destroyed by Jahan Shah (the Shah of the town of Tabriz in Persia). From 1477 to 1478 the city was held by the Ak Koyunlu tribesmen of Uzun Hassan.\n\n\n=== Iranian control ===\n\nAs early as the 1510s, Tbilisi (and the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) were made vassal territories of Safavid Iran. In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force. Following the death of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524), king David X of Kartli expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards. With the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of vali. Under the later rules of Teimuraz II and Heraclius II, Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule\u2014but, fearful of the constant threat of invasion, Georgia's rulers sought Russian protection in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Despite this agreement, the city was captured and devastated in 1795 by the Iranian Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who sought to re-establish Iran's traditional sovereignty over the region.\n\n\n=== Russian control ===\n\nIn 1801, the Russian Empire annexed the Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (of which Tbilisi was the capital), later cementing its rule with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, which ended Iranian control of Georgia. Tbilisi became the center of the Tbilisi Governorate (Gubernia). Russian Imperial administrators implemented a new European-style city plan and commissioned new buildings in Western styles. Roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in the Russian Empire, such as Batumi and Poti. By the 1850s, Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and a cultural center. The likes of Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Iakob Gogebashvili, Alexander Griboyedov and many other statesmen, poets and artists all found their home in Tbilisi. The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov, the Romanov family and others. The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day Rustaveli Avenue), on which the Viceroys of the Caucasus established their residence. For much of the 19th century, Tbilisi's largest ethnic group was Armenian, who, at some point, formed 74.3% of the population.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Brief independence ===\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city served as a location of the Transcaucasus interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent Transcaucasian Federation with the capital in Tbilisi. At this time, Tbilisi had roughly the same number of Armenians as Georgians, with Russians being the third largest ethnic group. It was here, in the former Caucasus Vice royal Palace, where the independence of three Transcaucasus nations \u2013 Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2013 was declared on 26 to 28 May 1918. After this, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until 25 February 1921. From 1918 to 1919 the city was also consecutively home to a German and British military headquarters.\nUnder the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian University City after the Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918. On 25 February 1921, the Bolshevist Russian 11th Red Army invaded Tbilisi and after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city, declared Soviet rule.\n\n\n=== Soviet rule ===\n\nIn 1921, the Democratic Republic of Georgia was occupied by the Soviet Bolshevik forces from Russia, and until 1936 Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the Transcaucasian SFSR (which included Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), and afterwards until 1991 as the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized, and it also came to be an important political, social, and cultural centre of the Soviet Union. In 1980 the city housed the first state-sanctioned rock festival in the USSR. As a major tourist destination for both Soviet citizens and foreign visitors, Tbilisi's \"Old Town\" (the neighborhoods within the original city walls) was reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s.Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the 9 March Massacre, in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of Nikita Khrushchev. Peaceful protests occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the April 9 tragedy was a peaceful protest that turned violent.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nSince the break-up of the Soviet Union, Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war, which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-Gamsakhurdia and Opposition forces clashed), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations among various mafia clans and illegal business operators. Even during the Shevardnadze Era (1993\u20132003), crime and corruption became rampant at most levels of society. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the Rose Revolution. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with decreasing crime rates, an improved economy, and a real estate boom. During the 2008 South Ossetia war, the Tbilisi area was hit by multiple Russian air attacks.\nAfter the war, several large-scale projects were started, including a streetcar system, a railway bypass and a relocation of the central station, and new urban highways. In June 2015, a flood killed at least twelve people and caused animals from the city's zoo to be released into the streets.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\nThe status of Tbilisi, as the nation's capital, is defined by the Article 10 in the Constitution of Georgia (1995) and the Law on Georgia's Capital \u2013 Tbilisi (20 February 1998).Tbilisi is governed by the Tbilisi City Assembly (Sakrebulo) and the Tbilisi City Hall (Meria). The City Assembly and mayor are elected once every four years by direct elections. The Mayor of Tbilisi is Kakha Kaladze and the Chairman of the Tbilisi city Assembly is Giorgi Alibegashvili.\n\nAdministratively, the city is divided into raions (districts), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general subdivision of the Soviet Union. Since Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:\n\nMtatsminda District Including Neighborhoods: Mtatsminda, Sololaki, Vera, Kiketi, Kojori, Shindisi, Tsavkikisi, Tabakhmela\nVake District Including Neighborhoods: Vake, Bagebi, Vazha Pshavela Quarters, Nutsubidze Plateau, Tskneti\nSaburtalo District Including Neighborhoods: Delisi, Vedzisi, Vashlijvari, Bakhtrioni, Khiliani, Didi Dighomi, Zurgovana\nKrtsanisi District Including Neighborhoods: Kala, Ortachala, Ponichala\nIsani District Including Neighborhoods: Avlabari, Navtlughi, Metromsheni, Vazisubani, Eighth Legioni\nSamgori District Including Neighborhoods: Varketili, Third Array, Orkhevi, Dampalo, Lilo, Lower Samgori\nChughureti District Including Neighborhoods: Chughureti, Kukia, Svanetisubani\nDidube District Including Neighborhoods: Didube, Didghomi Massive\nNadzaladevi District Including Neighborhoods: Nadzaladevi, Sanzona, Temka, Lotkini, Old Nadzaladevi\nGldani District Including Neighborhoods: Gldani Massive, Avchala, Mukhiani, GldanulaMost of the raions are named after historic quarters of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognise an informal system of smaller historic neighbourhoods. Such neighbourhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the Right Bank and the Left Bank of the Mt'k'vari. The names of the oldest neighbourhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.\nIn pre-Revolution Tiflis, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:\n\nIn the north part of the town, on the left bank of the Kur\u00e1 and to the south of the railway station, stretches the clean German Quarter, formerly occupied by German immigrants from W\u00fcrttemberg (1818). To the south is the Gruzinian or Georgian Quarter (Avlab\u00e1r). On the right bank of the Kur\u00e1 is the Russian Quarter, the seat of the officials and of the larger business firms. This is adjoined on the south by the Armenian and Persian Bazaars.\nAvlabari is considered \"the integral component of the so-called 'old Tbilisi'\" and is the object of planning and cultural heritage preservation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nTbilisi is located in the South Caucasus at 41\u00b0 43' North Latitude and 44\u00b0 47' East Longitude. The city lies in Eastern Georgia on both banks of the Mt'k'vari River. The elevation of the city ranges from 380\u2013770 metres above sea level (1,250\u20132,530 ft) and has the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the Saguramo Range, to the east and south-east by the Iori Plain, to the south and west by various endings (sub-ranges) of the Trialeti Range.\nThe relief of Tbilisi is complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Mt'k'vari River extends for more than 30 km (19 mi) from the Avchala District to River Lochini. The part of the city which lies on the right side of the Mt'k'vari River, on the other hand, is built along the foothills of the Trialeti Range, the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river Mt'k'vari. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on the right bank of the Mt'k'vari River. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.\nTo the north of the city, there is a large reservoir (commonly known as the Tbilisi Sea) fed by irrigation canals.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTbilisi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with considerable continental and semi-arid influences. The city experiences very warm summers and moderately cold winters. Like other regions of Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry period. The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and oceanic (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild microclimate compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.\nThe average annual temperature in Tbilisi is 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). January is the coldest month with an average temperature of 2.3 \u00b0C (36.1 \u00b0F). July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24.9 \u00b0C (76.8 \u00b0F). Daytime high temperatures reach or exceed 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) on an average of 22 days during a typical year.  The absolute minimum recorded temperature is \u221224.4 \u00b0C (\u221211.9 \u00b0F) in January 1883 and the absolute maximum is 42.0 \u00b0C (107.6 \u00b0F) on 17 July 1882. Average annual precipitation is 495.5 mm (19.5 in). May is the wettest month (averaging 77.6 mm (3.1 in) of precipitation) while January is the driest (averaging 18.9 mm (0.7 in) of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15\u201325 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs a multicultural city, Tbilisi is home to more than 100 ethnic groups. Around 89% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azerbaijanis. Along with the above-mentioned groups, Tbilisi is home to other ethnic groups including Ossetians, Abkhazians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Germans, Jews, Estonians, Kurds, Assyrians & Yazidis, and others.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nMore than 95% of the residents of Tbilisi practise some form of Christianity (the most predominant of which is the Georgian Orthodox Church). The Russian Orthodox Church, which is in Full communion with the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church have significant followings as well. A minority of the population (around 1.5%) practises Islam (mainly Shia Islam), while about 0.1% of Tbilisi's population practises Judaism. There is also a Roman Catholic church and the Yazidi Sultan Ezid Temple.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nUp until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding (polo in particular), wrestling, boxing, and marksmanship were the most popular city sports. Influence from the Russian Empire brought more Western sports and activities (billiards, fencing) to Tbilisi.\nThe Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary sports infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 handball arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the Dinamo Arena (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium (24,680 seats). The Sports Palace which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat approximately 11,000 people.\nVere Basketball Hall is a smaller indoor sports arena with a 2,500 seating capacity.\nThe most popular sports in Tbilisi today are football, rugby union, basketball, and wrestling. Also, popular sports include tennis, swimming and water polo. There are several professional football and rugby teams as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. National Basketball Association players Zaza Pachulia and Nikoloz Tskitishvili are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.\nTbilisi's signature football team, Dinamo Tbilisi, has not won a major European championship since the 1980\u20131981 season, when it won the European UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the Euroleague in 1962 but also never repeated any such feat.\nTbilisi will host several Group Phase matches for the EuroBasket 2021 in the country, Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne) and Italy (Milan).\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe large majority of Georgia's media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular Rustavi 2 television channel which gained considerable fame after its coverage of the Rose Revolution. In addition to Rustavi 2, the remaining three out of the four major public television channels of Georgia (including Imedi TV Maestro and the Public Broadcasting Channel) are based in the city. Tbilisi's television market has experienced notable changes since the second half of 2005 when Rustavi 2 successfully bought out the Mze TV company and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation became a shareholder of Imedi Media Holding at the beginning of 2006.\nTbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily 24 Saati (\"24 Hours\"), Rezonansi (\"Resonance\"), Alia, the English-language daily The Messenger, weekly FINANCIAL, Georgia Today, and the English-language weekly The Georgian Times. Out of the city's radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 FM), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.\nRadio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and Byzantine, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Beaux-Arts, Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles. Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801\u20131917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.\nTbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically-inflected Stalinist architecture in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building (\"Imeli\"), now housing the Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi.[2]\n\nTbilisi's postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union's most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi's 1975 Ministry of Roads and the 1984 Wedding Palace. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout \"kamikaze loggia\" overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Soon Tbilisi will have three skyscraper complexes. The Axis Towers, Redix Chavchavadze 64, and the new Ajara Hotel/Business Complex, which is currently under construction, will be the tallest buildings/skyscrapers in the Caucasus.[3]\n\n\n=== Theatre, dance and music ===\n\nThe city has important theatre and music institutions, such as the Tbilisi State Conservatoire, the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre, and the Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre.\n\n\n=== Arts museums and galleries ===\nThe Georgian National Museum gathers several important museums, including the Art Museum of Georgia. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 2012. Two independent contemporary art organisations, Kunsthalle Tbilisi and Open Space of Experimental Art, were founded in 2018.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nTbilisi has important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The Parliament and the government (State Chancellery) buildings of Georgia, the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Sameba Cathedral, the Vorontsov's Palace (also known as the Children's Palace today), the National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia, Tbilisi Circus, The Bridge of Peace, and many state museums are in Tbilisi. During the Soviet times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top four cities in the Soviet Union for the number of museums.\nOut of the city's historic landmarks, the most notable are the Narikala fortress (4th\u201317th century), Anchiskhati Basilica (6th century, built up in the 16th century), Sioni Cathedral (8th century, later rebuilt), and Church of Metekhi, Open Air Museum of Ethnography, Sulfur Bath, and Tbilisi Old City.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nBeyond traditional attractions, Tbilisi has developed burgeoning nightclub culture which started to attract international media attention in the 2010s. The leading clubs such as Bassiani, Mtkvarze, Khidi, and Caf\u00e9 Gallery have featured major international DJs as well as local performers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nWith a GDP at basic prices of 12,147 million Georgian lari (\u20ac4.3 billion) in 2014, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating almost 50 percent of Georgia's GDP. The service sector, including government services, is dominating and contributes 88 percent to GDP. Its GDP per capita of 10,336 Georgian lari (\u20ac3,600) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent. The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi's GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is \u2013 with 22.5 percent \u2013 significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nShota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport is Tbilisi's only international airport, located about 18 kilometres (11 miles) southeast of the city center. Handling 3.16 million passengers in 2017, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the seventeenth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56 million passengers in 11 months of 2018. It is a hub for the National carrier Georgian Airways and a Georgian-Chinese start-up Myway Airlines. \nAs of December 2018, various airlines serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as: London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Vienna, Paris, Doha etc.\nTbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first \"green airport\" in the Caucasus region in 2008.\nNatakhtari Airfield, located 33 km north of Tbilisi in the town of Natakhtari, is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to Batumi, Mestia and Ambrolauri.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tbilisi Metro serves the city with rapid transit subway services. It was the Soviet Union's fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966. The system operates two lines, the Akhmeteli-Varketili Line and the Saburtalo Line. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00 am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.\nThe third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and Tbilisi International Airport with a possible extension to Rustavi, 30 km east of Tbilisi.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nTbilisi had a tram network, since 1883 starting from horse-driven trams and from 25 December 1904 electric tramway. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, electric transport went to a degradation state within the years and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006 together with two trolleybus lines which were left. There are plans to construct a modern tram network.\n\n\n=== Minibus ===\nThe most dominant form of transportation is the minibus. An elaborate minibus system has grown in Tbilisi over the recent years. In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 tetri in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets, they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever he likes.\n\n\n=== Municipal bus ===\nThe second largest form of transportation are the municipal buses which are operated by Tbilisi Transport Company. As of October 2018, 672 buses of various size are servicing the city, majority of them are Ukrainian Bogdan A144 and A092 models along with 143 energy-efficient MAN Lion's City buses. New MAN Lion's City buses were put in service in 2017. Later in 2018, the tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta trucks&Buses won the tender and will be delivering aforementioned order in early 2019. In October 2018, at the Georgian Dream conference, it was announced that all the buses will be changed with new ones by the end of 2019, out of which 90 will be electric. Moreover, Kaladze asserted, that by 2020, Tbilisi will have 200 electric buses and the total number will reach 900.\n\n\n=== Aerial tramways ===\nHistorically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but all of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nSince 2012, Tbilisi has a modern, high-capacity gondola lift which operates between Rike Park and the Narikala fortress; each gondola can carry up to 8 persons. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner Ropeways.Since October 12, 2016, Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects Vake Park with Turtle Lake.\nSince October 2016, another Soviet-era aerial tramway between State University (Maglivi) and University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) is being reconstructed after 13 years of abandonment and is due for opening in April 2018. The original Italian-produced cabins produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti & Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, are being kept as well as the stations.\nDue to mismanagement at the hands of Soviet authorities, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.\n\n\n=== Funicular ===\nTbilisi funicular reopened 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built 1905, connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park, and covering almost 300 m (980 ft) in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower as well as some amusement rides, including a roller-coaster and a ferris wheel.\nThe half-way station of the funicular is just a short way away from Mtatsminda Pantheon, providing easy access to the necropolis.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognised medical education system. The biggest Georgian university is Tbilisi State University which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region. Over 35,000 students are enrolled and the number of faculty and staff (collaborators) is approximately 5,000. Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in Caucasus region \u2013 Tbilisi State Medical University, which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since that university operates as an independent educational institution, TSMU became one of the high-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. There are almost 5000 undergraduate and 203 postgraduate students at the university of whom 10% come from foreign countries.\nGeorgia's main and largest technical university, Georgian Technical University, is in Tbilisi. Georgian Technical University was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by the world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It achieved University status by 1990. The three most popular private higher educational institution in Georgia \u2014The University of Georgia (Tbilisi), Caucasus University, and the Free University of Tbilisi \u2013 are in Tbilisi.\n\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi) is the largest private University in Georgia, with more than 3500 international and local students. It was established in 2005 and soon became a market leader within Georgian educational sector. In 2010, the UG received financing from OPIC (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) for a development of the University's infrastructure and technical equipment. The University of Georgia has various undergraduate and graduate programs and it's the first company in Georgia which offers international certificate programs of the Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Zend technologies and Cisco Academy.\nCaucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB) (established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA). The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through the merger of two higher education schools: European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA). Today Free University comprises three schools \u2014 Business School (ESM), Institute of Asia and Africa and Law School \u2014 delivering academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels. In addition, Free University conducts a wide array of short-term courses and runs several research centers and summer school programs.\nHigher educational institutions in Tbilisi:\n\nTbilisi State University\nIlia State University\nGeorgian Technical University\nTbilisi State Conservatory\nShota Rustaveli Theatre and Film University\nTbilisi State Academy of Arts\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi)\nTbilisi State Medical University\nCaucasus University\nCaucasus International University\nTbilisi Medical Academy\nFree University of Tbilisi\nGrigol Robakidze University \u2013 Alma Mater\nGeorgian American University\nInternational Black Sea University\nGeorgian Institute of Public Affairs\nAgricultural University of Georgia\nInternational School of Economics (ISET)\nThe University of Geomedi\nNew Vision University\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Living in Tbilisi ==\nTbilisi is home to many foreigners. The number of foreigners living and working in Tbilisi has risen in recent years together with the openings of international schools, businesses, expat's communities, and online networks. Tbilisi is a very safe city. Most of the expatriates are living in Vake, Vera, Saburtalo, and Dighomi. A lot of expatriate communities could be found in Tbilisi. Some of them are charging a membership fee.\nIWA, International Women Association  is a non profit organisation founded in 1996 and its members and participants are International and Georgian women.\nExpats in Tbilisi is an Online Support Network founded by UN and EU Staff Spouses in Georgia Country to support expatriates in finding information and all relevant resources in one place.\nInter-nation International\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTbilisi is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAbo Tbileli, the patron saint of Tbilisi\nBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline\nList of Tbilisians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\nPostcard from the Silk Road -(Georgia), TRAVELS \u2013 ESPECIALLY FOR \u201eZNAD WILII\u201d, Leonard Dro\u017cd\u017cewicz, \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d, Vie\u0161oji \u012fstaiga \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d kult\u016bros pl\u0117tros draugija,ISSN 1392-9712 indeks 327956 nr 1 (57) z 2014 r., pp. 87\u201398, (in Polish)http://www.znadwiliiwilno.lt/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Znad-Wilii-57m.pdf\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the City of Tbilisi",

        "wiki": "The Svetitskhoveli Cathedral (Georgian: \u10e1\u10d5\u10d4\u10e2\u10d8\u10ea\u10ee\u10dd\u10d5\u10da\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10d9\u10d0\u10d7\u10d4\u10d3\u10e0\u10dd \u10e2\u10d0\u10eb\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8, svet'icxovlis sak'atedro t'adzari; literally the Cathedral of the Living Pillar) is an Orthodox Christian cathedral located in the historic town of Mtskheta, Georgia, to the northwest of the Georgian capital Tbilisi. A masterpiece of the Early and High Middle Ages, Svetitskhoveli is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. It is currently the second largest church building in Georgia, after the Holy Trinity Cathedral.\nKnown as the burial site of the claimed Christ's mantle, Svetitskhoveli has long been one of the principal Georgian Orthodox churches and is among the most venerated places of worship in the region. Throughout the centuries, the cathedral served as the burial place for kings. The present cross-in-square structure was completed between 1010 and 1029 by the medieval Georgian architect Arsukisdze, although the site itself dates back to the early fourth century. The exterior archature of the cathedral is a well-preserved example of typical decorations of the 11th century.\nSvetitskhoveli is considered an endangered cultural landmark; it has survived a variety of adversities, and many of its priceless frescoes have been lost due to being whitewashed by the Russian Imperial authorities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe original church was built in 4th century A.D. during the reign of Mirian III of Kartli (Iberia). St. Nino is said to have chosen the confluence of the Mtkvari (Kura) and Aragvi rivers as the place of the first Georgian Church.\nAccording to Georgian hagiography, in the 1st century AD a Georgian Jew from Mtskheta named Elias was in Jerusalem when Jesus was crucified. Elias bought Jesus\u2019 robe from a Roman soldier at Golgotha and brought it back to Georgia. Returning to his native city, he was met by his sister Sidonia who upon touching the robe immediately died from the emotions engendered by the sacred object. The robe could not be removed from her grasp, so she was buried with it. The place where Sidonia is buried with Christ's robe is preserved in the Cathedral. Later, from her grave grew an enormous cedar tree. Ordering the cedar chopped down to build the church, St. Nino had seven columns made from it for the church's foundation. The seventh column, however, had supernatural properties and rose by itself into the air. It returned to earth after St. Nino prayed the whole night. It was further said that from the seventh column a sacred liquid flowed that cured people of all diseases.\nIn Georgian sveti means \"pillar\" and tskhoveli means \"life-giving\" or \"living\", hence the name of the cathedral. An icon portraying this event can be seen on the third column on the left-hand from the entrance. Reproduced widely throughout Georgia, it shows Sidonia with an angel lifting the column in heaven. Saint Nino is in the foreground: King Mirian and his wife, Queen Nana, are to the right and left. Georgia officially adopted Christianity as its state religion in 337.\n\n\n=== Medieval and modern ===\nSvetitskhoveli Cathedral, originally built in the 4th century, has been damaged several times during history, notably by the invasions of Arabs, Persians and Timur, and latterly during Russian subjugation and the Soviet period. The building has also been damaged by earthquakes.\nThe present Svetitskhoveli Cathedral was built between 1010 and 1029 by the architect Arsukidze, at the invitation of the Catholicos Melchizedek I of Georgia. The king of Georgia at that time was Giorgi I (George I).\nA notable reconstruction was carried out at the end of 14th century after it was destroyed by Tamerlan. The next large renovation came in the beginning of 15th, when the current dome was built, being subsequently renovated again in the middle of 17th century.\nDuring the restoration of 1970-71 which was presided over by Vakhtang Tsintsadze, the base of the basilica built in the late 5th century by King Vakhtang Gorgasali after St. Nino's original church was found. During the early years of Georgian church building, the basilica was the dominant type of the Georgian church architecture before the crossed-dome style emerged.\nThe cathedral is surrounded by a defensive wall, built of stone and brick during the reign of King Erekle II (Heraclius) in 1787.\nIn the beginning of 1830s the cathedral was visited by the Russian Emperor. In connection with this, the portal galleries, surrounding the church from the north, west and south, which had been in unsatisfactory condition, were demolished.\nArchaeological expeditions in 1963 found the 11th century house of the Patriarch at the southern part of the wall. Inside the church yard, the remains of the two-story palace of Patriarch Anton II were found.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe cathedral is set on a flat lowland, amidst the old town of Mtskheta as its most significant construction, visible from nearly every spot. \n\nThe base of the three-storey basilica, supposed to have been built by Vakhtang Gorgasali after St.Nino's original church, was found by archaeologists during the restoration of 1970-71. Its remnants can be seen in the western and southeastern parts, as well as under the pillars below the floor. The remnants of an even older wooden church were found inside in the southern arm of the cross.\nThe architecture of the present Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, which dates from around 1020, is based on the cross-dome style of church architecture, which emerged in Georgia in the early Middle Ages and became the principle style after the political unification of Georgia by Bagrat III (978-1014). The characteristic of this style is that the dome is placed across all four sides of church. There was originally a more harmonic three-step silhouette, with portals from the south, west and north. The northern and southern portals were demolished in the 1830s. The current entrance to the cathedral is from the west.\nThe structure of the church is intended to ensure good acoustics. Large windows on the dome and walls give a significant amount of light. In its plan the church is a cross with shorter transverse and longer longitudinal arms. The east end has an apse. The dome of Svetitskhoveli was reconstructed several times over the centuries to keep the church in good condition. The current dome is from the 15th century with its upper part reconstructed in the 17th century, when it lost its original size and was reduced in height.\nThe basic stone used for the Cathedral is a sandy yellow with trimmings, while around the apse window a red stone is used. The green stone used in the drum of the cupola is from the 17th century.\nThe church facades are richly decorated. The curved blind arcading throughout is unaltered from the 11th century. The arches genuinely ascend or descend according to height of the corresponding part of the facade, creating an impression of constant movement. Two high and deep niches of the eastern facade are in clear contrast with surrounding illuminated walls. Each window is surrounded by ornamental stripe and stylised peacock tail-like decorations. Similar decorations are found in the upper parts of the eastern niches. A writing above the windows of eastern facade tell that the church was built by katolikos Melchisedek. Above it, two low-reliefs, an eagle with open wings and a lion under it, are set to the south from the three more recent accessory windows under the roof.\n\nA large window occupies most of the western top side of the church. The decoration shows the Ascension of Jesus, with Christ sitting on the throne and two angels at the both sides. This triangle-shaped decoration fits harmoniously with triangle of the cornice and an arch below it. The original sculpture on the wall has not survived, but was restored several times, most recently in the 19th century.\n\n\n=== The architect Arsukidze ===\nA legend surrounds a relief sculpture on the external northern wall.  This shows a right arm and hand holding a chisel - symbol of the stonemason \u2013 with an inscription reads::The Hand of Arsukidze,\nslave of God,\nmay forgiveness be his.\nAn inscription on the east fa\u00e7ade further attests to the fact that Arsukidze did not live to see his masterpiece finished (in 1029):\n\n:This holy church was built by the hand of Thy wretched servant, Arsukidze.\nMay your soul rest in peace, O Master.\nKonstantine Gamsakhurdia's novel The Hand of the Great Master relates the legend, for which there is no documentary evidence, that a priest who had also been Arsukidze's patron and teacher was so jealous of Arsukidze's success that he used his influence with the king to have the architect's right hand cut off. According to the novel, King George was also jealous of Arsukidze over his lover, the beautiful Shorena.\n\n\n=== Icons and frescoes ===\n\nThe cathedral interior walls were once fully adorned with medieval frescoes, but many of them did not survive. In the 1830s, when Emperor Nicholas I was scheduled to visit Mskheta, Russian authorities razed the galleries and whitewashed timeless frescoes as part of an effort to give the cathedral a \"tidier look\"; in the end the Czar never even came. Today, after much careful restoration, some frescoes survive, including a 13th-century depiction of the \"Beast of the Apocalypse\" and figures of the Zodiac.The walls are decorated with many Christian Orthodox icons,  most of which are not original (the originals being in the national museums of Georgia). The decoration of the church stonework also features carved grapes (as in many churches of Georgia), reflecting the country's ancient wine-making traditions. The large figure of Jesus at the altar was painted by Russian artist in the 19th century. The majority of the icons here date to the 20th century. Some are copies of older icons and frescoes from other churches throughout Georgia.\nTwo bulls' heads on the east fa\u00e7ade, remnants of the 5th-century church, attest to the folk influence on Christian iconography in that early period.\n\n\n=== Baptismal font ===\nOn the right side from the entrance of the Cathedral is a stone baptismal font dating from the 4th century. It is thought to have been used for the baptism of King Mirian and Queen Nana. Immediately behind the font is a reproduction of the relief of Arsukidze's right hand and bevel found on the north facade.\n\n\n=== Symbolic copy of the Chapel of Holy Sepulchre ===\n\nOn the south side there is a small stone church built into the Cathedral. This is a symbolic copy of the Chapel of Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Built between the end of the 13th and the beginning the 14th centuries, it was erected here to mark Svetitskhoveli as the second most sacred place in the world (after the church of Jerusalem), thanks to Christ's robe. In front of this stone chapel, the most westerly structure aligned with the columns between the aisle and the nave marks Sidonia's grave. Remains of the original life-giving pillar are also here. It was built in the 17th century. Scenes of the lives of King Mirian and Queen Nana, and portraits of the first Christian Byzantine Emperor, Constantine I, and his mother Helena, were painted by G. Gulzhavarashvili at that time. Traces of the foundations of the 4th-century church have been found here.\n\n\n=== Throne of Catholicos-Patriarch ===\nThe second structure aligned with the columns of the southern aisle was also built in the 17th century as the throne of Catholicos Diasamidze. It no longer serves this function, as current tradition requires a throne for the Georgian patriarch to be in the centre of the church.\n\n\n== Burials in the Cathedral ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nSvetitskhoveli was not only the site of the coronation of the Georgian kings but also served as their burial place. Ten are known to have been buried here, although only six tombs have been found, all before the altar. The tomb of King Vakhtang Gorgasali can be found in the central part of the cathedral and identified by the small candle fortress standing before it. King Erekle II's tomb is identifiable by the sword and shield upon it. His son, George XII was the last king of Georgia and his marble tomb is next to his father's. Also in front of the altar are tombs of David VI, George VIII, Luarsab I and various members of the Bagrationi royal family including Tamar, the first wife of George XI, whose epitaph dating from 1684 is written both in Georgian (Asomtavruli) and Arabic script.\n\n\n== Other burials ==\nDomentius IV of Georgia\n\n\n== Other constructions ==\n\nThe cathedral stands in the middle of the large yard, surrounded by high walls with towers, dating back to 18th century. The top storie was designed for military purposes and has gun emplacements. The entrance to the Cathedral from the wall is located to the west. The wall has eight towers: six cylindrical and two square. The remnants of a palace and the 11th century two-stories tower above the gate are found in the southwestern part of the yard. The tower is faced by stones, with archature and two bull heads on the west facade, and has a passage with volt on the ground floor. A writing tells that the tower was built by katolikos Melchisedek.\n\n\n== Threats ==\nA 2010 UNESCO report has found that structural issues threaten the overall stability of the cathedral.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u0410. \u041c\u0446\u0445\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u0421\u0432\u044d\u0442\u0438-\u0426\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438. \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. 1900\n\n\n== External links ==\nLocation of Svetitskhoveli Cathedral on the city map of Mtskheta\nLonely Planet Guide\nMax Planck Institute\nUNESCO site",

It belongs to the Georgian Orthodox Church and dates from the sixth century.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to the old Georgian annals, the church was built by the King Dachi of Iberia (circa 522-534) who had made Tbilisi his capital. Originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary, it was renamed Anchiskhati (i.e., icon of Ancha) in 1675 when the treasured icon of the Savior created by the twelfth-century goldsmith Beka Opizari at the Ancha monastery in Klarjeti (in what is now part of northeast Turkey) was moved to Tbilisi so preserve it from an Ottoman invasion. The icon was preserved at the Basilica of St Mary for centuries (it is now on display at the Art Museum of Georgia).\n\nThe basilica was damaged and rebuilt on several occasions from the 15th through 17th centuries due to wars between Georgia and the Persians and Turks. The brick belfry near the Anchiskhati Basilica was built by Catholicos Domenti in 1675.\nThe look of the structure was drastically changed in the 1870s, when a dome was added. During the Soviet period, all religious ceremonies at Anchiskhati Basilica were halted, and the building transformed into a museum for handicrafts. It was later used as an art studio. From 1958 to 1964 restoration works took place in celebration of the 1500th Jubilee of the founding of Tbilisi, which changed the view of the church back to the seventeenth-century version, however, it was not until 1991, after the independence of Georgia was restored, that the basilica reverted to religious use.\nThe Anchiskhati Choir based out of the Anchiskhati Basilica  is the world's leading exponent of Georgian polyphonic choral music.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nAnchiskhati Basilica is a three-span basilica, divided by two abutments forming horseshoe shaped conches, which indicates the antiquity of its construction. Originally constructed of blocks of yellow tuff stone, the 1958-1964 restoration made extensive use of brick. The structure has entrances on three sides, but today only the western entrance is in use. Aside from the altarpiece, which was painted in 1683 by order of Catholicos Nikoloz Amilakhvari, all of the remaining paintings in the church date from the 19th century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTbilisi city government site",

        "wiki": "Tbilisi (English:  t\u0259-bih-LEE-see, t\u0259-BIL-ih-see; Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 [t\u02b0bilisi] (listen)), in some countries also still known by its pre-1936 international designation, Tiflis ( TIF-lis), is the capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of approximately 1.5 million people. Tbilisi was founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tbilisi was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy, governing both Southern and Northern Caucasus.\nBecause of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global powers. The city's location to this day ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and the Modern structures.\nHistorically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though it is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Its notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from 20 to 32 \u00b0C (68 to 90 \u00b0F) in the summer and 7 to \u22121 \u00b0C (45 to 30 \u00b0F) in the winter.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe name Tbilisi derives from Old Georgian t\u2032bilisi (Asomtavruli: \u10b2\u10a1\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8\u10b1\u10a8, Mkhedruli: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8), and further from tpili (Modern Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8, 'warm', itself from Old Georgian: \u10b2\u10b4\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8 \u1e6dpili). The name T\u2032bili or T\u2032bilisi (literally, 'warm location') was therefore given to the city because of the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs.\nUntil 1936, the name of the city in English and most other languages was Tiflis, while the Georgian name was \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 (Tpilisi).On 17 August 1936, by order of the Soviet leadership, the official Russian names of various cities were changed to more closely match the local language. In addition, the Georgian-language form T\u2032pilisi was modernized on the basis of a proposal by Georgian linguists; the ancient Georgian component \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (tpili, 'warm') was replaced by the newer \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (t\u2032bili). This form was the basis for a new official Russian name (\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438 Tbilisi).  Most other languages have subsequently adopted the new name form, but some languages such as Turkish, Persian, Greek, and German have retained a variation of Tiflis.\nOn 20 September 2006, the Georgian parliament held a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the renaming.\nSome of the traditional names of Tbilisi in other languages of the region have different roots.  The Ossetian name \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a (Kalak) derives from the Georgian word \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e5\u10d8 (kalaki) meaning simply 'town'. Chechen and Ingush names for the city use a form similar to or the same as their names for the country of Georgia (\u0413\u0443\u044c\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0445 G\u00fcr\u01b6ex) as does the historical Kabardian name (\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0436\u044b Kwrd\u017e\u0259), while Abkhaz \u049a\u0430\u0440\u04ad (\u0136ar\u0163) is from the Mingrelian \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8 (Karti).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi since the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age. During the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus. According to legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted variant of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King Vakhtang I of Iberia (r. c. 447/49 \u2013 502/22) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either a hawk or other small birds of prey in the legend). The King's falcon allegedly caught or injured a pheasant during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died from burns. King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and build a city on the location.\nKing Dachi of Iberia (r. 522\u2013534), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved the capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries. From the 6th century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region's strategic location along important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.\n\n\n=== Foreign domination ===\n\nTbilisi's favorable trade location, however, did not necessarily bode well for its survival. Located strategically in the heart of the Caucasus between Europe and Asia, Tbilisi became an object of rivalry among the region's various powers such as the Roman Empire, Parthia, Sassanid Persia, Muslim Arabs, the Byzantine Empire, and the Seljuk Turks. The cultural development of the city was somewhat dependent on who ruled the city at various times, although Tbilisi was fairly cosmopolitan.\nFrom 570\u2013580, the Persians ruled the city until 627, when Tbilisi was sacked by the Byzantine/Khazar armies and later, in 736\u2013738, Arab armies entered the town under Marwan II. After this point, the Arabs established an emirate centered in Tbilisi. In 764, Tbilisi \u2013 still under Arab control \u2013 was once again sacked by the Khazars. In 853, the armies of Arab leader Bugha Al-Turki invaded Tbilisi in order to enforce its return to Abbasid allegiance. The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050. In 1068, the city was once again sacked, only this time by the Seljuk Turks under Sultan Alp Arslan.\n\n\n=== Capital of Georgia ===\nIn 1121, after heavy fighting with the Seljuks, the troops of the King of Georgia David IV of Georgia besieged Tbilisi, which ended in 1122 and as a result David moved his residence from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State and thus inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age. From 12\u201313th centuries, Tbilisi became a regional power with a thriving economy and astonishing cultural output. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and a cultural center not only for Georgia but for the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. During Queen Tamar's reign, Shota Rustaveli worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. This period is often referred to as \"Georgia's Golden Age\" or the Georgian Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Mongol domination and the following period of instability ===\nTbilisi's \"Golden Age\" did not last for more than a century. In 1226, Tbilisi was captured by the Khwarezmian Empire Shah Jalal ad-Din and its defences severely devastated and prone to Mongol armies. In 1236, after suffering crushing defeats to the Mongols, Georgia came under Mongol domination. The nation itself maintained a form of semi-independence and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi was strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols retreated from Georgia and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state once again. An outbreak of the plague struck the city in 1366.\nFrom the late 14th until the end of the 18th century, Tbilisi came under the rule of various foreign invaders once again and on several occasions was completely burnt to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was invaded by the armies of Tamerlane. In 1444, the city was invaded and destroyed by Jahan Shah (the Shah of the town of Tabriz in Persia). From 1477 to 1478 the city was held by the Ak Koyunlu tribesmen of Uzun Hassan.\n\n\n=== Iranian control ===\n\nAs early as the 1510s, Tbilisi (and the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) were made vassal territories of Safavid Iran. In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force. Following the death of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524), king David X of Kartli expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards. With the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of vali. Under the later rules of Teimuraz II and Heraclius II, Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule\u2014but, fearful of the constant threat of invasion, Georgia's rulers sought Russian protection in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Despite this agreement, the city was captured and devastated in 1795 by the Iranian Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who sought to re-establish Iran's traditional sovereignty over the region.\n\n\n=== Russian control ===\n\nIn 1801, the Russian Empire annexed the Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (of which Tbilisi was the capital), later cementing its rule with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, which ended Iranian control of Georgia. Tbilisi became the center of the Tbilisi Governorate (Gubernia). Russian Imperial administrators implemented a new European-style city plan and commissioned new buildings in Western styles. Roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in the Russian Empire, such as Batumi and Poti. By the 1850s, Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and a cultural center. The likes of Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Iakob Gogebashvili, Alexander Griboyedov and many other statesmen, poets and artists all found their home in Tbilisi. The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov, the Romanov family and others. The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day Rustaveli Avenue), on which the Viceroys of the Caucasus established their residence. For much of the 19th century, Tbilisi's largest ethnic group was Armenian, who, at some point, formed 74.3% of the population.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Brief independence ===\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city served as a location of the Transcaucasus interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent Transcaucasian Federation with the capital in Tbilisi. At this time, Tbilisi had roughly the same number of Armenians as Georgians, with Russians being the third largest ethnic group. It was here, in the former Caucasus Vice royal Palace, where the independence of three Transcaucasus nations \u2013 Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2013 was declared on 26 to 28 May 1918. After this, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until 25 February 1921. From 1918 to 1919 the city was also consecutively home to a German and British military headquarters.\nUnder the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian University City after the Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918. On 25 February 1921, the Bolshevist Russian 11th Red Army invaded Tbilisi and after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city, declared Soviet rule.\n\n\n=== Soviet rule ===\n\nIn 1921, the Democratic Republic of Georgia was occupied by the Soviet Bolshevik forces from Russia, and until 1936 Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the Transcaucasian SFSR (which included Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), and afterwards until 1991 as the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized, and it also came to be an important political, social, and cultural centre of the Soviet Union. In 1980 the city housed the first state-sanctioned rock festival in the USSR. As a major tourist destination for both Soviet citizens and foreign visitors, Tbilisi's \"Old Town\" (the neighborhoods within the original city walls) was reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s.Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the 9 March Massacre, in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of Nikita Khrushchev. Peaceful protests occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the April 9 tragedy was a peaceful protest that turned violent.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nSince the break-up of the Soviet Union, Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war, which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-Gamsakhurdia and Opposition forces clashed), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations among various mafia clans and illegal business operators. Even during the Shevardnadze Era (1993\u20132003), crime and corruption became rampant at most levels of society. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the Rose Revolution. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with decreasing crime rates, an improved economy, and a real estate boom. During the 2008 South Ossetia war, the Tbilisi area was hit by multiple Russian air attacks.\nAfter the war, several large-scale projects were started, including a streetcar system, a railway bypass and a relocation of the central station, and new urban highways. In June 2015, a flood killed at least twelve people and caused animals from the city's zoo to be released into the streets.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\nThe status of Tbilisi, as the nation's capital, is defined by the Article 10 in the Constitution of Georgia (1995) and the Law on Georgia's Capital \u2013 Tbilisi (20 February 1998).Tbilisi is governed by the Tbilisi City Assembly (Sakrebulo) and the Tbilisi City Hall (Meria). The City Assembly and mayor are elected once every four years by direct elections. The Mayor of Tbilisi is Kakha Kaladze and the Chairman of the Tbilisi city Assembly is Giorgi Alibegashvili.\n\nAdministratively, the city is divided into raions (districts), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general subdivision of the Soviet Union. Since Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:\n\nMtatsminda District Including Neighborhoods: Mtatsminda, Sololaki, Vera, Kiketi, Kojori, Shindisi, Tsavkikisi, Tabakhmela\nVake District Including Neighborhoods: Vake, Bagebi, Vazha Pshavela Quarters, Nutsubidze Plateau, Tskneti\nSaburtalo District Including Neighborhoods: Delisi, Vedzisi, Vashlijvari, Bakhtrioni, Khiliani, Didi Dighomi, Zurgovana\nKrtsanisi District Including Neighborhoods: Kala, Ortachala, Ponichala\nIsani District Including Neighborhoods: Avlabari, Navtlughi, Metromsheni, Vazisubani, Eighth Legioni\nSamgori District Including Neighborhoods: Varketili, Third Array, Orkhevi, Dampalo, Lilo, Lower Samgori\nChughureti District Including Neighborhoods: Chughureti, Kukia, Svanetisubani\nDidube District Including Neighborhoods: Didube, Didghomi Massive\nNadzaladevi District Including Neighborhoods: Nadzaladevi, Sanzona, Temka, Lotkini, Old Nadzaladevi\nGldani District Including Neighborhoods: Gldani Massive, Avchala, Mukhiani, GldanulaMost of the raions are named after historic quarters of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognise an informal system of smaller historic neighbourhoods. Such neighbourhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the Right Bank and the Left Bank of the Mt'k'vari. The names of the oldest neighbourhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.\nIn pre-Revolution Tiflis, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:\n\nIn the north part of the town, on the left bank of the Kur\u00e1 and to the south of the railway station, stretches the clean German Quarter, formerly occupied by German immigrants from W\u00fcrttemberg (1818). To the south is the Gruzinian or Georgian Quarter (Avlab\u00e1r). On the right bank of the Kur\u00e1 is the Russian Quarter, the seat of the officials and of the larger business firms. This is adjoined on the south by the Armenian and Persian Bazaars.\nAvlabari is considered \"the integral component of the so-called 'old Tbilisi'\" and is the object of planning and cultural heritage preservation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nTbilisi is located in the South Caucasus at 41\u00b0 43' North Latitude and 44\u00b0 47' East Longitude. The city lies in Eastern Georgia on both banks of the Mt'k'vari River. The elevation of the city ranges from 380\u2013770 metres above sea level (1,250\u20132,530 ft) and has the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the Saguramo Range, to the east and south-east by the Iori Plain, to the south and west by various endings (sub-ranges) of the Trialeti Range.\nThe relief of Tbilisi is complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Mt'k'vari River extends for more than 30 km (19 mi) from the Avchala District to River Lochini. The part of the city which lies on the right side of the Mt'k'vari River, on the other hand, is built along the foothills of the Trialeti Range, the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river Mt'k'vari. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on the right bank of the Mt'k'vari River. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.\nTo the north of the city, there is a large reservoir (commonly known as the Tbilisi Sea) fed by irrigation canals.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTbilisi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with considerable continental and semi-arid influences. The city experiences very warm summers and moderately cold winters. Like other regions of Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry period. The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and oceanic (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild microclimate compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.\nThe average annual temperature in Tbilisi is 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). January is the coldest month with an average temperature of 2.3 \u00b0C (36.1 \u00b0F). July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24.9 \u00b0C (76.8 \u00b0F). Daytime high temperatures reach or exceed 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) on an average of 22 days during a typical year.  The absolute minimum recorded temperature is \u221224.4 \u00b0C (\u221211.9 \u00b0F) in January 1883 and the absolute maximum is 42.0 \u00b0C (107.6 \u00b0F) on 17 July 1882. Average annual precipitation is 495.5 mm (19.5 in). May is the wettest month (averaging 77.6 mm (3.1 in) of precipitation) while January is the driest (averaging 18.9 mm (0.7 in) of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15\u201325 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs a multicultural city, Tbilisi is home to more than 100 ethnic groups. Around 89% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azerbaijanis. Along with the above-mentioned groups, Tbilisi is home to other ethnic groups including Ossetians, Abkhazians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Germans, Jews, Estonians, Kurds, Assyrians & Yazidis, and others.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nMore than 95% of the residents of Tbilisi practise some form of Christianity (the most predominant of which is the Georgian Orthodox Church). The Russian Orthodox Church, which is in Full communion with the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church have significant followings as well. A minority of the population (around 1.5%) practises Islam (mainly Shia Islam), while about 0.1% of Tbilisi's population practises Judaism. There is also a Roman Catholic church and the Yazidi Sultan Ezid Temple.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nUp until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding (polo in particular), wrestling, boxing, and marksmanship were the most popular city sports. Influence from the Russian Empire brought more Western sports and activities (billiards, fencing) to Tbilisi.\nThe Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary sports infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 handball arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the Dinamo Arena (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium (24,680 seats). The Sports Palace which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat approximately 11,000 people.\nVere Basketball Hall is a smaller indoor sports arena with a 2,500 seating capacity.\nThe most popular sports in Tbilisi today are football, rugby union, basketball, and wrestling. Also, popular sports include tennis, swimming and water polo. There are several professional football and rugby teams as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. National Basketball Association players Zaza Pachulia and Nikoloz Tskitishvili are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.\nTbilisi's signature football team, Dinamo Tbilisi, has not won a major European championship since the 1980\u20131981 season, when it won the European UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the Euroleague in 1962 but also never repeated any such feat.\nTbilisi will host several Group Phase matches for the EuroBasket 2021 in the country, Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne) and Italy (Milan).\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe large majority of Georgia's media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular Rustavi 2 television channel which gained considerable fame after its coverage of the Rose Revolution. In addition to Rustavi 2, the remaining three out of the four major public television channels of Georgia (including Imedi TV Maestro and the Public Broadcasting Channel) are based in the city. Tbilisi's television market has experienced notable changes since the second half of 2005 when Rustavi 2 successfully bought out the Mze TV company and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation became a shareholder of Imedi Media Holding at the beginning of 2006.\nTbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily 24 Saati (\"24 Hours\"), Rezonansi (\"Resonance\"), Alia, the English-language daily The Messenger, weekly FINANCIAL, Georgia Today, and the English-language weekly The Georgian Times. Out of the city's radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 FM), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.\nRadio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and Byzantine, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Beaux-Arts, Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles. Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801\u20131917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.\nTbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically-inflected Stalinist architecture in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building (\"Imeli\"), now housing the Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi.[2]\n\nTbilisi's postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union's most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi's 1975 Ministry of Roads and the 1984 Wedding Palace. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout \"kamikaze loggia\" overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Soon Tbilisi will have three skyscraper complexes. The Axis Towers, Redix Chavchavadze 64, and the new Ajara Hotel/Business Complex, which is currently under construction, will be the tallest buildings/skyscrapers in the Caucasus.[3]\n\n\n=== Theatre, dance and music ===\n\nThe city has important theatre and music institutions, such as the Tbilisi State Conservatoire, the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre, and the Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre.\n\n\n=== Arts museums and galleries ===\nThe Georgian National Museum gathers several important museums, including the Art Museum of Georgia. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 2012. Two independent contemporary art organisations, Kunsthalle Tbilisi and Open Space of Experimental Art, were founded in 2018.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nTbilisi has important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The Parliament and the government (State Chancellery) buildings of Georgia, the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Sameba Cathedral, the Vorontsov's Palace (also known as the Children's Palace today), the National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia, Tbilisi Circus, The Bridge of Peace, and many state museums are in Tbilisi. During the Soviet times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top four cities in the Soviet Union for the number of museums.\nOut of the city's historic landmarks, the most notable are the Narikala fortress (4th\u201317th century), Anchiskhati Basilica (6th century, built up in the 16th century), Sioni Cathedral (8th century, later rebuilt), and Church of Metekhi, Open Air Museum of Ethnography, Sulfur Bath, and Tbilisi Old City.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nBeyond traditional attractions, Tbilisi has developed burgeoning nightclub culture which started to attract international media attention in the 2010s. The leading clubs such as Bassiani, Mtkvarze, Khidi, and Caf\u00e9 Gallery have featured major international DJs as well as local performers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nWith a GDP at basic prices of 12,147 million Georgian lari (\u20ac4.3 billion) in 2014, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating almost 50 percent of Georgia's GDP. The service sector, including government services, is dominating and contributes 88 percent to GDP. Its GDP per capita of 10,336 Georgian lari (\u20ac3,600) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent. The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi's GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is \u2013 with 22.5 percent \u2013 significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nShota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport is Tbilisi's only international airport, located about 18 kilometres (11 miles) southeast of the city center. Handling 3.16 million passengers in 2017, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the seventeenth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56 million passengers in 11 months of 2018. It is a hub for the National carrier Georgian Airways and a Georgian-Chinese start-up Myway Airlines. \nAs of December 2018, various airlines serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as: London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Vienna, Paris, Doha etc.\nTbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first \"green airport\" in the Caucasus region in 2008.\nNatakhtari Airfield, located 33 km north of Tbilisi in the town of Natakhtari, is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to Batumi, Mestia and Ambrolauri.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tbilisi Metro serves the city with rapid transit subway services. It was the Soviet Union's fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966. The system operates two lines, the Akhmeteli-Varketili Line and the Saburtalo Line. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00 am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.\nThe third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and Tbilisi International Airport with a possible extension to Rustavi, 30 km east of Tbilisi.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nTbilisi had a tram network, since 1883 starting from horse-driven trams and from 25 December 1904 electric tramway. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, electric transport went to a degradation state within the years and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006 together with two trolleybus lines which were left. There are plans to construct a modern tram network.\n\n\n=== Minibus ===\nThe most dominant form of transportation is the minibus. An elaborate minibus system has grown in Tbilisi over the recent years. In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 tetri in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets, they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever he likes.\n\n\n=== Municipal bus ===\nThe second largest form of transportation are the municipal buses which are operated by Tbilisi Transport Company. As of October 2018, 672 buses of various size are servicing the city, majority of them are Ukrainian Bogdan A144 and A092 models along with 143 energy-efficient MAN Lion's City buses. New MAN Lion's City buses were put in service in 2017. Later in 2018, the tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta trucks&Buses won the tender and will be delivering aforementioned order in early 2019. In October 2018, at the Georgian Dream conference, it was announced that all the buses will be changed with new ones by the end of 2019, out of which 90 will be electric. Moreover, Kaladze asserted, that by 2020, Tbilisi will have 200 electric buses and the total number will reach 900.\n\n\n=== Aerial tramways ===\nHistorically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but all of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nSince 2012, Tbilisi has a modern, high-capacity gondola lift which operates between Rike Park and the Narikala fortress; each gondola can carry up to 8 persons. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner Ropeways.Since October 12, 2016, Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects Vake Park with Turtle Lake.\nSince October 2016, another Soviet-era aerial tramway between State University (Maglivi) and University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) is being reconstructed after 13 years of abandonment and is due for opening in April 2018. The original Italian-produced cabins produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti & Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, are being kept as well as the stations.\nDue to mismanagement at the hands of Soviet authorities, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.\n\n\n=== Funicular ===\nTbilisi funicular reopened 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built 1905, connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park, and covering almost 300 m (980 ft) in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower as well as some amusement rides, including a roller-coaster and a ferris wheel.\nThe half-way station of the funicular is just a short way away from Mtatsminda Pantheon, providing easy access to the necropolis.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognised medical education system. The biggest Georgian university is Tbilisi State University which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region. Over 35,000 students are enrolled and the number of faculty and staff (collaborators) is approximately 5,000. Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in Caucasus region \u2013 Tbilisi State Medical University, which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since that university operates as an independent educational institution, TSMU became one of the high-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. There are almost 5000 undergraduate and 203 postgraduate students at the university of whom 10% come from foreign countries.\nGeorgia's main and largest technical university, Georgian Technical University, is in Tbilisi. Georgian Technical University was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by the world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It achieved University status by 1990. The three most popular private higher educational institution in Georgia \u2014The University of Georgia (Tbilisi), Caucasus University, and the Free University of Tbilisi \u2013 are in Tbilisi.\n\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi) is the largest private University in Georgia, with more than 3500 international and local students. It was established in 2005 and soon became a market leader within Georgian educational sector. In 2010, the UG received financing from OPIC (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) for a development of the University's infrastructure and technical equipment. The University of Georgia has various undergraduate and graduate programs and it's the first company in Georgia which offers international certificate programs of the Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Zend technologies and Cisco Academy.\nCaucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB) (established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA). The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through the merger of two higher education schools: European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA). Today Free University comprises three schools \u2014 Business School (ESM), Institute of Asia and Africa and Law School \u2014 delivering academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels. In addition, Free University conducts a wide array of short-term courses and runs several research centers and summer school programs.\nHigher educational institutions in Tbilisi:\n\nTbilisi State University\nIlia State University\nGeorgian Technical University\nTbilisi State Conservatory\nShota Rustaveli Theatre and Film University\nTbilisi State Academy of Arts\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi)\nTbilisi State Medical University\nCaucasus University\nCaucasus International University\nTbilisi Medical Academy\nFree University of Tbilisi\nGrigol Robakidze University \u2013 Alma Mater\nGeorgian American University\nInternational Black Sea University\nGeorgian Institute of Public Affairs\nAgricultural University of Georgia\nInternational School of Economics (ISET)\nThe University of Geomedi\nNew Vision University\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Living in Tbilisi ==\nTbilisi is home to many foreigners. The number of foreigners living and working in Tbilisi has risen in recent years together with the openings of international schools, businesses, expat's communities, and online networks. Tbilisi is a very safe city. Most of the expatriates are living in Vake, Vera, Saburtalo, and Dighomi. A lot of expatriate communities could be found in Tbilisi.

        "wiki": "Norashen (Armenian: \u0546\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0577\u0565\u0576, \"newly built\"; Georgian: \u10dc\u10dd\u10e0\u10d0\u10e8\u10d4\u10dc\u10d8, Norasheni) is a non-functioning Armenian Apostolic church in Tbilisi, Georgia. It is located in the old town, near Sioni Cathedral and Jvaris Mama Church.The church has historically been known as the Church of the Holy Mother of God (\u054d\u0578\u0582\u0580\u0562 \u0531\u057d\u057f\u057e\u0561\u056e\u0561\u056e\u056b\u0576, Surb Astvatsatsin). Built in early 16th century, the church belonged to the Armenian Apostolic Church until it was shut down and confiscated by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s, later serving as a library. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the church was consecrated by Georgian Orthodox clergy as an Orthodox church in 1995, while Armenian traces were removed from in and around the church. Armenian protests eventually led to it being closed indefinitely.\nMore controversy around the church arose in 2008 when a Georgian priest built a fence around the church and attempted to remove some of the Armenian gravestones. It is one of the several defunct Armenian churches in Tbilisi that the Armenian Church has unsuccessfully sought to return to use in the post-Soviet period.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was built in 1507 by a wealthy Armenian noble named Satat (\u054d\u0561\u057f\u0561\u0569), who probably held the title of a paron (baron). He devoted it to the memory of his grandfather, father, his wife, their three sons and himself. The church was renovated in 1650, through funding by Khoja Nazar of New Julfa who erected a khachkar, embedded into the interior wall a year earlier, in 1649. The church's frescoes were created by Hovnatan Hovnatanian of the prominent Hovnatanian family in 1793. The church was greatly damaged in 1795 during the Persian invasion of Tbilisi by Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar. Melik Avetik, of the Behbudian (Bebutashvili) family, ordered a complete renovation of the church in 1795 that likely lasted until 1808.The church underwent several more renovations through the 19th century, in 1830\u20131835, 1857, and 1897, and 1899. The male school of Norashen was established in 1858. In 1866 the female school of Norashen was opened. Like many other places of worship, Norashen was one of the Armenian churches in Tbilisi shut down by the Soviet authorities on December 22, 1933. As of 1972 the church housed a scientific library of the Georgian SSR Academy of Sciences. According to Samvel Karapetyan, some changes were made to the church in 1983 when the area was undergoing renovation. Employees of the Division of Monuments Preservation, under the supervision of Shota Kavlashvili, Tbilisi's chief architect, reportedly removed the church's northern portal as a \"redundancy\" and some Armenian tombstones disappeared.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nThe church was historically an Armenian Apostolic church; it was mentioned as an Armenian Church by French traveler Jean Chardin in 1673 and by Georgian scholar Egnati Ioseliani in 1837. However, since the last years of Soviet rule, some Georgian scholars, officials, and, most notably, the Georgian Orthodox Church have disputed the ownership of the church. As early as 1989 Jansouk Babounashvili, Deputy Director of the Department of Monuments Preservation of Georgia, declared Norashen to be a Georgian Orthodox church built in the 13th century. Bondo Arveladze, a Georgian historian, claimed Norashen was \"illegally built by Armenians on the ruins of an Orthodox church\" since there are no documents in the archives \"authorizing its construction issued by the tsar or the patriarch of that time.\u201d On the other hand, Sozar Subari, Georgia's Ombudsman, noted in 2006 that it is common knowledge that Norashen is an Armenian church and Armenian claims for return are rightful.In their 2005 report on the state of religious freedom in Georgia, the U.S. Department of State noted that \"many problems among traditional religious groups stem from property disputes\" and that the \"prominent Armenian church in Tbilisi, Norashen, remains closed.\" According to a 2011 news report by RFE/RL Norashen is the \"biggest source of Georgian-Armenian tensions.\" According to Blauvelt and Berglund the Georgian government does not return Norashen to the Armenian Church because \"officials did not dare to challenge\" the Georgian Orthodox Church. As of 2008, it was owned by the Ministry of Economy, while the Ministry of Culture was responsible for maintenance. As of 2016 the church had a status of cultural heritage. Beka Mindiashvili, a Georgian theologian, has criticized the indecision on the part of the authorities as a relic of the Soviet legacy.\n\n\n=== \"Georganization\" efforts ===\n\n\n==== 1994\u201395 alterations ====\nIn November 1994 books began to be taken out of the church. Teodoros Jokhadze, secretary of Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia, declared that the existence of an Armenian church in the proximity of the Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral was not acceptable and that it should me \"made Georgian.\" On February 15, 1995 Georgian Orthodox clergy consecrated the church according to Georgian church rituals and declared its new name: Khareba (\"Annunciation\" or \"Our Lady of Good News\"; Georgian: \u10e7\u10dd\u10d5\u10da\u10d0\u10d3\u10ec\u10db\u10d8\u10d3\u10d0 \u10e6\u10d5\u10d7\u10d8\u10e1\u10db\u10e8\u10dd\u10d1\u10da\u10d8\u10e1 \u10ee\u10d0\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10ee\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0, k\u2019ovladtsmida ghvtismshoblis kharebis sakhelobis ek\u2019lesia). Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, locum tenens of the Armenian Catholicos, expressed his concerns with the move in a letter to Georgia's President Eduard Shevardnadze and Patriarch Ilia II. A month later, in March 1995, Armenian Church figures visited Tbilisi upon invitation of the local Armenian community, who protested the move. The delegation met with Patriarch Ilia II and the parties agreed to close the church for an indefinite period and create a committee to study the ownership of disputed churches.In 1994\u201395, several alterations were made to the church. Armenian sources accuse the Georgian Church and Georgian authorities in erasing the church's Armenian traces and elements. For instance, the bema (elevated platform) was reportedly lowered, khachkars embedded into the walls were removed, Armenian inscriptions and frescoes were erased. Samvel Karapetyan of the Research on Armenian Architecture (RAA) argued that the Georgian authorities have systematically removed Armenian characteristics from the church. According to Karapetyan the baptistery located near the internal northern wall was destroyed, while the old doors were replaced with new ones featuring a Georgian-style cross. A tombstone located near the northern entrance of the church was paved with asphalt.\n\n\n==== 2005 and 2008 controversies ====\nIn the spring of 2005 Father Tariel Sikinchelashvili, the priest of the neighboring Jvaris Mama Orthodox Church, moved Georgian tombstones into the yard of Norashen. They were placed near the southern wall of the church. Meanwhile, the tombstones that contained Armenian inscriptions were vandalized. According to Samvel Karapetyan's research, at least one gravestone of an individual who died in 1874 was brought by Father Tariel from Dusheti, where he had been a priest before moving to Tbilisi. Karapetyan noted that the priest, thus, sought to \"Georganize\" the church. Father Tariel declared during the controversy: \"The land is ours, the church is ours and we do whatever we want and what we are told to do.\"In mid-May 2008 Father Tariel ordered a concrete-metal fence and gates to be built around Norashen. The fence is decorated with symbols characteristic to the Georgian Church. Father Tariel also claimed at the time that Georgian liturgy \"will start no later than in a month after all interior repairs inside the building itself finish.\" The Armenian Church diocese in Georgia protested the move. The municipality of Tbilisi made a decision to remove the fencing, however, it was not carried out.On November 16, 2008 Father Tariel attempted to remove the gravestones of Mikayel and Lidia Tamamshyans (Tamashev) with the help of a bulldozer. Protests by the Armenian community were successful in returning the gravestones to their original sites. The incident was widely covered in Armenia. The Armenian Church criticized the Georgian priest and called on Georgian authorities to return the church. Vardan Astsatryan, the head of the Armenian government's department on national minorities and religion, called it an act of vandalism. A protest was held in front of Georgia's embassy in Yerevan. Armenian parliament speaker Hovik Abrahamyan expressed his concerns with the issue to Georgia's ambassador to Armenia.On December 8, 2008 Armenia's Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan, government ministers, Armenian clergy prayed inside the church in what became the first Armenian prayer in Norashen since the 1930s.\n\n\n=== Later developments ===\nIn 2014 the Georgian National Agency for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage made a decision to restore the church. It was funded by the Foundation for the Preservation of Georgian Historical Monuments. In total, some 504,000 lari was spent on its renovation. The restoration works were carried out in 2015-16 and were aimed at strengthening its walls and dome. Furthermore, the old doors and windows were replaced with new ones and the original Armenian gravestones were returned.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nArmenians in Georgia\nList of Armenian churches in Tbilisi\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliographyMouradian, Parouyr (2008). \"\u0539\u056b\u0586\u056c\u056b\u057d\u056b \u0570\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0581 \u0546\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0577\u0565\u0576 \u0565\u056f\u0565\u0572\u0565\u0581\u0578\u0582 \u056b\u0580\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u057a\u0561\u057f\u0574\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0568 [The real story of Norashen Armenian Church of Tbilisi]\".

        "wiki": "Oleg Timchenko is a contemporary painter and founder of the \"10th Floor Group\". He was born in Old Tbilisi and studied painting at the Tbilisi Academy of Fine Arts.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1917, shortly after the Russian Revolution, the family of Oleg Timchenko's mother fled to Georgia to escape repressions due to the noble origins of their family.\nHis grandfather was the painter Evgenyi Gulitskii. Gulitskii was a businessman aiding the first Russian aviators and various progressive technologically advanced projects.\nOleg Timchenko's father, Ivan Timchenko, was also a painter. Originally from Vitebsk, Belarus, Ivan Timchenko was working in Caucasus, where he met Oleg's mother.\nTimchenko's brother, Konstantine, worked in a royal chancellery of the Emperor Nicholas II.\nOleg Timchenko's ancestors migrated to Georgia from St Petersburg and Vitebsk.  For this reason \"migration\" is the artist\u2019s fate determined by physical resettlement of his ancestors and embodied in his art. His paintings are imitation of \"migration\" to various countries, epochs, space and cultural layers, through his personal or genetic memory.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1987\u20131991, Oleg worked as a painter in the Marjanishvili Theater. During this time, Timchenko and his friends created the theater group called \"10th Floor Group\", which was composed of Georgian Happening artists.\nSeveral Years later he established another artist group called \"Marjanishvili\".\n\n\n== Art ==\nHis early works of the 1980s are noted with an ascetic expressionism and were gradually replaced by firework expression determined by intensity of color and stroke. Timchenko follows these two trends from the very beginning, but with time the margin between them becomes more obvious.\nMigration plays a part in the Timchenko\u2019s work representing various countries, epochs, space and cultural layers, through his personal or genetic memory.\nIn general, Timchenko is interested in characters \u2013 whether it is Ophelia, the Sphinx, Infantas, Pontius Pilate, or a dwarf, \u2013 and is said to be an empathetic participant of the story rather than a distant story-teller. He makes his characters and attributes in the images of people, animals, toys, plants, and objects that eventually turn into the models of his art and then he makes up new stories about each of them.\nHe has been considered a \u201ctransformer\u201d artist whose art is a means of transformation. Timchenko's works often create a whole set of contrasting characters \u2013 sad angels, tragic dancing gnomes, wonder-struck forest ghosts with childish and non-childish expressions, often decorated with roses, precious stones, and jewelry.  Timchenko often employs invention in this process of transformation:  Infantas make friends with \u201cdolls\u201d, princes with leopards, Ali Baba with a crane, a toy horse with a childish and na\u00efve expression gallops from one picture to another.\nPerhaps his most noted work, \"Ophelia\" (1996) was born from the idea of creating a projection in waters. The themes surrounding Ophelia have a close link to all of Timchenko's work. For him she embodies the paradox of \"beauty\" and \"transitoriness\". Timchenko: \"I paint neither trees nor leaves. I paint the wind touching the leaves\" \u2014 in this case the water touching Ophelia.\nTimchenko realized a more literal version of this idea in 1998 in Prague, where he installed a projector at the Charles Bridge and a canvas of 8 x 3 metres beneath the surface of the Vltava river. After a subsequent exhibition in Bratislava, he installed a projector over an aquarium of the original size of the painting 1999 in Paris.\nOleg Timchenko is a \u201creactionary\u201d artist and his reaction is compassion. He loves the world, is interested in and suffers from the \u201cpain\u201d of the latter. His personal feelings are transformed into eternal topics. He touches on the themes involving a drama, strong emotions: love, death, beauty, psycho-somatic difference, risk, fear, pain. He is a bit grotesque, expressive, expressly childish, but not na\u00efve. He rather has a nostalgic approach of an adult toward childhood, having a desire to play and a priority to detect beauty in every happening.  \nExpression was there from the very start \u2013 as early as in the \"tenth floor\" period. However, in the beginning the dramatic tension was not so permeated with beauty. This occurred later, i.e. one vision was enriched with another. The ascetic expressionism of the 1980s was gradually replaced by fireworkish expression determined by intensity of color and stroke. The effect of \"firework,\" i.e. processing of the surface of the picture with paint, creates the effect of 'explosion,\" \"pulsation\" of a color and gives the picture vibrating visual impression creating illusion of a celebration and fairy tale. The firework-like style, sometimes with a touch of \"kitsch,\" and minimalism of the style \u2013 the artist follows these two trends from the very beginning, but with time the margin between them becomes more obvious. The topic of the picture itself dictates to the painter the style which is sometimes realistic and surface patterned, and sometimes so poster-like and generalized that the image can be presented as a sign or symbol. That is, the \"reality is replaced by the signs of reality.\" As a result of such generalization, the symbol separated from the basic reality, acquires new meaning. Therefore, in Oleg Timchenko's paintings ordinary items, objects or characters maintaining their historic or cultural context, simultaneously become inhabitants of a new hyper-real world created by the painter. At the same time this world contains continuous surprises.\nThrough each new series of pictures the artist extends the \"territory\" of his works and expands the \"map\" of his world. The figure tied to the flying crane\u2019s leg from the series of Ali Baba\u2019s journey is the symbol of the artist himself who shares with us his impressions of this \"journey\" through his works.\n\n\n== Solo exhibitions ==\n2011 \u2013 \"Come Together\", Art Bazaar, New York, New York\n2008 \u2013 \"The Condition\", Tbilisi, Georgia\n2008 \u2013 Embassy of Georgia, Hague, Holland\n2005 \u2013 Center Point Gallery, Tbilisi, Georgia.\n2004 \u2013 \"Nostalgia\", Botanical Garden, Tbilisi, Georgia.\n2003 \u2013 Gallery Hobby, Tbilisi, Georgia.\n2001 \u2013 \"Game\", N Gallery, Tbilisi, Georgia.\n1998 \u2013 Project \"Ophelia\", Video-installation on the river, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\n\n== Group exhibitions ==\n2009 \u2013 \"Reflection\", Gallery Telescope, Tbilisi, Georgia.\n2008 \u2013 \"Condition\", Gallery Baia, Tbilisi, Georgia.\n2007 \u2013 \"Nostalgia\", Gallery Baia, Tbilisi, Georgia.\n2007 \u2013 \"Bucephalus\", Photo-installation, Gallery Baia, Tbilisi, Georgia.\n2007 \u2013 \"Let's strengthen together Justice of Georgia\", Art center \"Muza\", gallery TMS, Tbilisi, Georgia.\n2006 \u2013 Modern Art Center, Moscow, Russia.\n2006 \u2013 Workshop \"Paper\", Baku, Azerbaijan.\n2006 \u2013 \"Mansard of artists\", 1st Biennale in Petersburg, Russia.\n2005 \u2013 Workshop \"Wind from Caucasus\", Art Willa Garikula, Georgia.\n2003 \u2013 Gallery Vernisage, Tbilisi, Georgia.\n2002 \u2013 Festival \"Tabla\", Photo-exhibition, Art Center VWK, Vienna, Prague.\n2001 \u2013 Slide \u2013 projection \"Forest souls\", Geneva, Switzerland.\n2000 \u2013 \"Aquarium\", Paris, France.\n1998 \u2013 Exhibition space at UNESCO, Paris, France.\n1997 \u2013 Gallery IFA, Berlin, Germany.\n1993 \u2013 2nd Biennale of Contemporary Art, Cetin, Montenegro.\n1992 \u2013 \"World of senses\", project of Victor Miziano, Moscow, Russia.\n1992 \u2013 \"Heat and Conduct\", Sheffield museum, Gallery Arlophin, Bristol, UK.\n1990 \u2013 1st International Biennale of Art, Saint Petersburg, Russia.\n1988 \u2013 \"Black and White Gallery\", Budapest, Hungary.\n1987 \u2013 \"Person + Art\", Leipzig, Gallery Friedrich, K\u00f6ln, Germany.\n1987 \u2013 \"10th floor\", Artist House, Tbilisi, Georgia.\n1986 \u2013 \"10th floor\", Tbilisi History Museum, Georgia.\n1985 \u2013 International Music Festival in Telavi, Group \"Archivarius\", Georgia.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nTsaritsino Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow, Russia\nLudwig Museum \u2013 Budapest, Hungary\nTbilisi Museum of Contemporary Art\nOffice of Mayor of Bristol\nGallery of Francoise Fridrikch \u2013 Koln, Germany\nVien Gallery \u2013 Vienna, Austria\nWolfgang Flatz \u2013 Personal Collection\nPresident Saakashvili \u2013 Personal Collection\nBadri Patarkachishvili \u2013 Personal Collection\nLiana Lobzhanidze's private collection, Tbilisi, Georgia\nTatyana Kolodzei Foundation \u2013 USA\nRosa Marquise Private collection, Amsterdam, Holland, France, USA, Germany, Russia\n\n\n== References ==\n\nhttp://www.square-arthouse.net/ophelia/index.php\nhttp://www.theartdossier.com/blog/?p=1145\nhttp://www.inartgallery.com/artists/oleg-timchenko.html?view=item&layout=item\nhttp://www.inartgallery.com",

        "wiki": "The 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident was an aerial tramway accident in Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet Georgia on June 1, 1990, which resulted in 20 deaths and  at least 15 injuries. \n\nThe accident involved two gondolas on a ropeway route between Rustaveli Avenue and Mount Mtatsminda. Red gondola number 1 was on its way down from the slope of the mountain, nearing the lower supporting tower, and red gondola number 2 was nearing an upper tower, when the hauling rope broke inside the coupler of the upper gondola. Both gondolas rolled down simultaneously. The lower gondola slammed into the wall of the lower station, killing four and injuring many others. The upper gondola generated a higher speed (the length of ropeway was 863.3 metres or 2,832 feet); on reaching the lower support tower, it struck the broken hauling rope, which was hanging on the tower, causing the cable to tear the gondola apart. \nThe collision was so strong that the track cable fell off the tower, dangling the cut-open gondola above the rooftops. This also caused the cabin to slide further down, striking the roof of a six-storey building below. This caused even further destruction to the gondola and caused people to fall 20 metres (66 ft) onto the rooftops and ground below. Twenty people were killed and at least 15 badly injured. Most were children on a sightseeing tour to Tbilisi from School Number 5 of the regional town of Akhaltsikhe, to celebrate Children's Day. Surviving witnesses from both gondolas say that the brakes did not work in either of the gondolas, despite the desperate attempts of guides and passengers who helped them to pull the brakes.\nIn 1988, two years prior to the accident, the cable car underwent major reconstruction under the lead of head engineer Vakhtang Lejava. Originally the cable car used three supporting towers. Redesigning this meant replacing the 20-metre-high (66 ft) lower mast with a new 25-metre-high (82 ft) mast. Two short upper masts (10 to 12 m or 33 to 39 ft high) were also replaced by one 20-metre-high (66 ft) mast. Prior to this change, the gondolas had a slight climbing angle on the two upper masts. Using a single higher mast caused the new gondolas to run from the upper station horizontal to the mast and then, with a sharp angle, head down. The standard oval Georgian gondolas (with a capacity of 25 per gondola), produced in Tbilisi by Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing, were replaced by Italian larger rectangular ones built by \"Lovisolo\" and provided by \"Ceretti & Tanfani\", providing greater passenger capacity (40 per gondola). The braking system of the new gondolas did not function properly \u2013 while climbing over the upper mast, the braking system would incorrectly engage. The service staff would have to climb on top of the gondola and turn it off manually when this occurred. To avoid this inconvenience, the brakes were just turned off. Additionally, on the day of the accident, both gondolas were over-capacity: the lower gondola had 46 passengers on board, the upper gondola held 47 passengers.\nAccident investigation documentation does not identify the cause of the hauling rope breaking inside the coupler. Many unanswered questions still remain, and the cause of the accident is not known.\nThe track and hauling cables were dismantled while the damaged gondolas were dismantled after three years. The masts and the stations were kept intact. The aerial tramway was never restored. In 2014, the upper station and both supporting masts were dismantled due to planned restoration of the tramway as a reversible gondola cable car, running from a relocated lower station. However, the upper station location remained the same. The old lower station, due to its unique architecture, is a cultural heritage object. The planned restoration was abandoned due to local opposition and visual flaws of the new lower station on one of the main squares of the city in front of Radisson Hotel. Another issue with the restoration was the oversized five supporting masts, two of them being located on hilly streets, causing already narrow streets to reduce even more in width.\nAs of January 2017, an aerial tramway is under construction from the original lower station, with the location of the upper station remaining the same. The work will be carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group. The major challenge is to adapt the lower station backyard for a monocable detachable gondola infrastructure, because the lower station was only designed for aerial tramway type of cable car in 1958. Construction has faced problems because of the high density small housing which appeared in the backyard of the lower station throughout the years and the area near the future lower mast being challenging for big lorries with construction materials to approach.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCavalese cable car disaster (1976)\nCavalese cable car disaster (1998)\nSaint-\u00c9tienne-en-D\u00e9voluy cable car disaster\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Excellent and safe tram ride which takes you to the top and gives a breathtaking view of Tbilisi. On top too the view is amazing and nice. The park was not worthy and many rides weren\u2019t available in winter. But you can travel up for the ride and view.",
          "I'm really seriously afraid of heights, so just in case anyone else has a similar fear, I thought I'd give some info on that! It's a little bit scary towards the top as there are large windows on each side of the car and you do feel suspended in mid-air fairly high up. However",
          "Inexpensive and convenient way to get on top of a hill with great view of Tbilisi. Suggest to walk back down through old town",
          "As with all tourists this is a one of things to do in Tbilisi. You take it especially if u want to go to the botanical gardens which really isnt anything fancy. So take the 2 way trip instead amd skip the botanical walk",
          "To go on top i guess is the only option to get on top.. Its cheap for return ride, and you will get perfect view from glassy cabin!",
          "great way to take aerial photos of the old city. very fast, it takes like a minute to go up. the easiest way to go to the fortress, much better than the stairs! keep in mind that credit cars are not accepted, so you must carry some cash. it is not expensive at all.",
          "It was very windy that day and we were not sure if it would be operational but we went anyways. We were lucky the tramway was working for few hours, after we reached up it was stopped. We went back on the stairs and it was well worth the walk",
          "Best views of city Suitable for whole family Really good restaurants esp cafeteria Very good chox bun with custard cream, delicious. Excellent park with loads of different rides Very large park with rides spread out There is a small park where you don't have to pay but most",
          "On a very cold day, we took the cable car up to see the incredible views. Took gorgeous photos from all angles. No lines to get on ride either way. Very. Well organized and accessible. Bonus, shopping at the top too! Kids would especially love this fun ride.",
          "This is a quick and easy way to access the fortress at the top of the mountain. Great for photo ops on the way up. You can then walk down from the top. Allow yourself time to explore the area. On super windy days the tramway might not be running. Plan accordingly.",
          "My family and I enjoyed the cable car ride after walking around narikala fortress and seeing the mother of Georgia statue up close. The ride was pleasant with beautiful views.",
          "We took the Tram while walking from our hotel. There was no line, easy access a d only cost about 2 dollars to take up and back. We spent about 30 minutes at the top.",
          "What I really like in Tbilisi in terms of transportation is you can use 1 card for Trains, Bus even cable cars! Another thing is it's good for 2 persons! We paid 2 lari/1person for a one way going to Narikala Fortress. It gives us a wonderful view and looks safe.",
          "We bought round trip tickets for two people on the tramway and were told to keep the receipt. Good thing we did, because on the way down they tried to charge us again and we had to show the receipt. You'll admire the views on the way up, and it's only a short distance to the",
          "Inexpensive fee for such amazing views! The whole city is at your feet! Take the tramp up and walk down. I discovered several great places by walking! Even cascade!",
          "The Tbilisi cable car starts at Rike Park across the River Kura. You can use the official Tbilisi metro card or just buy one (not very expensive) ticket. The cabin is spacious but if there are people in it that stand around and spoil the view it is difficult to take photos.",
          "My family and myself visited Tbilisi in Feb, 2018 and had good fun during the tip. One thing we enjoyed the most is the aerial view of Tbilisi from the Tramway.",
          "Lovely day when I took this and you can see over the whole city.Justwalking aroud it didn't give much idea how it is pread out.",
          "A nice way to go up the mountain to Mother Georgia monument. Could be a great tourist attraction if speed of the Tramway would be a bit lower... cuz views are nice, but you just have not enough time to enjoy those",
          "Not a long trip up to see the fortress and the \u2018Mother of Georgia\u2019 statue. Some great views over the old and new city areas.",
          "See on the tram was super lovely i ever seen. But on europe park, suddenly one man came and put on his bird on my shoulder and take photo not on my purpose. And the others bring more bird and put on my body even i said No. And they said \"not FREE\". give 20lari per bird. And i",
          "I was here with my family we had fun and saw the city from the sky high. There are shops to buy hand made things and some cafe",
          "A must do when visiting Tbilisi. Great views on the journey and good views when you reach the top. Very cheap you can also pay using the Tbilisi metro card which is a must for getting around using all public transport. You can buy these at any metro station and you can top them",
          "Modern gondola and great value that takes you up to the fortress overlooking the city and the Mother of Georgia statue. Also an easy walk down to get into the historic old town in Tbilisi - a must go attraction for the city.",
          "The cable car passes over the busy city, providing a nice view. It\u2019s very short distance and time about 2 minutes. It will take you from down near the glass bridge to the top near to the Mother of Georgia statue. Overall nice to add to your itinerary.",
          "This ride only lasts a couple of minutes so you don\u2019t have time to see much. Probably would be nicer during later hours after it gets dark. Price is reasonable so in that sence why not. Especially if you are heading up to the hill anyway.",
          "Tickets are simple to buy, at the counter , purchase ticket and card at the same time. Ride is 2 mn long approx and up the hill , you visit the statue of Mother of the Nation and maybe botanical gardens or just return by foot along the old city streets. You can also ride back!!",
          "Great view for the money! At the time it was 2.5 GEL for person. Personal talked english there weren't any problems to get the card.",
          "Its wonderfull to tram down , was a lovely experience travelling up by a clif chair and coming down through a beautifull veiw",
          "The cable car to the fortress is a convenient way to get there with decent views enroute. To get back down it is better to walk, as that way you can combine a proper look at the fortress with some of the old town attractions.",
          "Tbilisi is an interesting city, vibrant and affluent but also has a historical feel..the pano view is worth the cable ride where one will have a great view of the city, watching the daily routine or movements of the local people.",
          "Part of the city tour this was really nice yet short up to the Narikala fortress .... good ride just keep your camera ready !!!",
          "The walk from the city up to the top of the fortress was rewarding for the views and an excellent exercise for my legs and lung. The walk from the fortress to the cable car station and the mother of Georgia statue comparably was a leisurely walk. The cable car trip down to the",
          "Finally, got to see it all up there in a cable car! The best feeling ever\ud83d\udc9cThe city scape at night was perfect.",
          "We used the tram as part of our wandering. It is a very interesting experience to see the city from a higher level. It is a must, in order to get the big picture ;-)",
          "This is well worth the trip and the views from the top are superb. Bring good walking shoes as there are many steps at the top if you want to see all the views.",
          "How could you not love to see the view from the top! No need for an expensive helicopter ride when this city can offer the same view in the cheapest possible! It was so trilling as we travel up away on the other side of the old Tbilili, the ride was so smooth and slow you wont",
          "Pretty simple to get to ,Rike park pay 12 GEL both ways and cable carts come regularly. Didn\u2019t wait in line and up on the mountain there are shops and a zip line on offer. Enjoy \ud83d\ude0a",
          "For only 2.5 GEL (one way), you can take the best aerial picture of Tbilisi. The ride is only about 3 minutes so put your camera on video mode. Don't worry if you miss some shots, just ride it again and again :)",
          "Well worth the trip. Once at the top enjoy amazing views of the city and mountains on the horizon. Take the zipline down into the Botanic garden to finish off an amazing experience.",
          "make it the first place to visit gives you a great view of whole city to arrange next places to visit",
          "This is a must-do while visiting Tbislisi, as it offers a fantastic view over the whole city ! It takes only a few minutes to go to the top, and once up the hill you have have a little walk around and enjoy the view. Very reasonably priced",
          "very nice experience to view the city from the top. i must say that this is a must do when you visit georgia.",
          "Very impressive view while riding so i take twice (day time & night time. Highly recommend for the night while watching Narikala fortress in the charming light. Can be paid by the same card for bus or metro.",
          "if you are in Tbilisi - take the aerial tramway for nice looks over the city and a visit to mother Georgia",
          "It was very nice experience. Since weather was clear we could see entire city from it. City view from top is good. Nothing much to do at top other than view.",
          "I had a ride with my family and had a wonderful view of Tbilisi from above. I recommend this activity to Tbilisi visitors.",
          "The Ariel tramway is a must if your visiting Tbilisi, for 2 GEL it\u2019s a short wait for the 3 minute cable car that gives you some of the most spectacular views of the city from the fortress.",
          "Easy and fun way to see the city and go to the fortress of Tbilisi. Be smart and use your metro card instead of paying more. You can use the metro card for this ride just like any other transport in the city. The employees were confused I knew this, as a tourist. There are",
          "The Cable ride is short, but the view is spectacular. It works from 10 am to 12 am, during this time. Do be dressed for hiking.",
          "An adrenaline rush if you not too used to being suspended in a Tram taking in the view of Tbilisi. A definite repeat of this trip is already on our plans and the Tramway will again be a highlight for us. My sweets \ud83c\udf6d and I will do this trip again",
          "We enjoyed the short cable car ride up to the \u201cMother of Georgia\u201d statue offering good views of the city and an easy walk back down via the fortress. There is no need for return tickets and the cost is only 2.50 Lari per person each way provided you have a metro card.",
          "1st day in Georgia, we had a walk tour with \u2018David\u2019 he is from \u2018Holiday Me\u2019 it was a nice experience, as the view of Tbilisi on top is amazing.",
          "We loved our tram ride to the top of Tbilisi! Gorgeous views from every angle of trees and stunning Tbilisi! We were four in tram ride which was very clean with sparkling windows for best views and photos! On top is a park with Ferris wheel and great view of communication tower.",
          "I rode the cable car from the bottom to the top and it wasn\u2019t busy had the whole car for myself which allowed me to take great pictures of the city. It seems that most of people come down with it. Definitely worth riding. Once up top you can visit the fortress and the statue of",
          "Low cost and easy yeti visit. It opens at 10.00 and used the same card that can be used on the metro. Great views from on top. Built by the Swiss so safe to use",
          "We descended two times by that tram. Smooth and easy ride over the river, worth doing by day or by night. Almost queues for descending, considerably big queue for ascending, trams are frequent (going around all the time) but it might still be some waiting. Price was, as far as I",
          "Great service, impossibly low price. Worth taking a couple of times: those lights in the evening and that much detail in broad daylight. A must.",
          "Great views of city and Mother Georgia statue. If you feel fit you can walk down via a staircase and steep cobbled road.",
          "Great view is the first point you will notice. Great restaurant around. Tourism attractions, Bookings for all tourists trips available in this area",
          "At last I got to get the ride on this cable car ride. You need to buy a metro card to get on this. Worth it. What a wonderful experience though it was very windy when I was on it that it stopped for a minute right ontop of the Mtsika River!",
          "For only 2.5 Lari you are whisked from the Rike Park to the top of Narikala, traversing the Old Town in the process. Great views, and a convenient way of getting to the top!",
          "This is an excellent way to see the city from above.You can get to Narikala and the view of the city from Narikala in the night is lovely.",
          "What to do in Tbilisi....... aha, the aerial Tramway, not knowing what to expect, we took the ride up ( and down ), had a walk on top of the mountain, enjoyed the view over the city....... and that was it. Nothing spectacular",
          "This was an excellent ride. Do it at night. You need to buy a 2 Lari card and each ride costs 2 Lari. The view of the city at night is great. Once on top, visit Mother Georgia and the Narikala fortress.",
          "After a short wait in the line we hopped into the cabin of tramway.The staff were friendly and helpful. The cabin itself was modern and comfortable. After hopping out at the top, we\u00b4ve seen an amazing view of the whole Tbilise and from the other side of the hill, we saw the",
          "obviously it is a very touristic oriented activity and thousands of them flock here daily but i would still reccomend doing it at least once for the great views and of course for many people in bad shape, its a great solution for the otherwise steep climb. you need the metro",
          "The view from the cable car was awesome especially during the night time. However, it was tiring to wait for the turn in a long queue.",
          "A great ride with spectacular views of the city to the Top where we visited the Mother of Georgia Statue and the Narikala Fortress. Do walk down if you like to enjoy the views longer.",
          "I really like aerial tramways like this, so we had fun taking this one up the hill. You have to buy a ticket at the station down hill, but that's pretty straight forward. You can wait for a pivate car or join others in theirs. The ride uphill is around 5 minutes, it's pretty",
          "This is a great way to get a view of the city and surprisingly cheap. It's also a good way to get up and visit the Botanical Gardens and other attractions on the hillside.",
          "We really enjoyed the ride in a modern cable car up to the fort and church. It was also possible to visit the gardens. We decided to walk down and it was not difficult.",
          "Despite being a resident of Tbilisi, this ride was my first one on this wonderful air-tram. We went up to a castle from the park below with our foreign business guests. The ride was exciting as it goes over the Mtkvari river, on top of old Tbilisi style buildings on the hillside",
          "A short journey to the top at a very low price. Great views of the city from the cable car and at the top. If you walked up instead, it would be a VERY steep climb!",
          "here is one more great attraction and must visit probably go in the evening time so you can enjoy day light and when you are on top see the whole city lighted and statue mother of Georgia",
          "Absolute worth to go there...we drove by taxi upstairs and went down by the ropeway...spectacular...if you are in Tbilisi only for a short time, THIS is the thing to do....",
          "Very cheap - 6 GEL return. The que goes very fast. At the top you get a beautiful view over the town. Do it in the evening when the town lights up.",
          "From the centre of Tbilisi up to Mother of Georgia, it is really nice view from up, recommend to try.",
          "Cable car runs from Rike Park up to the fortress and is inexpensive scenic way to get to the top. I recommend it",
          "Great panoramic view of the old part of Tbilisi. You can use it during daytime and in the evening and see city lights.",
          "It was a short ride but enjoyable with great views of the city. The cost was cheap at only a few dollars. This experience was worth doing.",
          "The lines to the ticket counter are so long. We were queuing for almost one hour to get the ticket. Ticket price is 2 Lari one way, but you can walk back down. The cable ride will give you a chance to see the city. However is just a short ride, but you're able to take some",
          "Vehicles also go to the top so the cable car is optional. On the top you get to see the Mother of Georgia Statue, Botanical Garden and the Narikala Fortress. The views of the city from the top are nice. The walk to St Nicholas Church is a long one. There are vendors selling",
          "Well I was glad it was up to European safety standards. However due to only having 7 gondolas the queue was very long and made frustrating that we saw at least 1 Russian group paying off an attendant to skip the queue.",
          "it depends if you have in your country a cable car or not, in my case , we have and it is way better than this one , in Tiblisi you need to stand under the sun for 1 hour to get a ticket , to go just for 3 mins up and that's it. i advise you to go the other way around, go up to",
          "This tram is definitely not scary for even a person with height issues and is a really quick way to travel to the top so you can do a walk down rather than walk up.",
          "It's just a short ride, the time waiting in line it's much longer. At least on the way down from the mountain it's better to walk.",
          "The aerial tramway itself is a nice convenient way to get from the river straight to the top of the mountain. However, the waiting line to get on board is continuously long. With good legs you could also climb the steep path uphill in about 15-20min",
          "The windows are dark, so taking pictures from here is not very convenient. The cabins are new and comfortable. However, I would recommend everyone to go down the mountain on foot.",
          "I'm not used of paying 2.5GEL for something so elevating :) Cabins have tinted windows and take 6-8 passengers. Ride takes about two minutes. Lovely, worth a try.",
          "Brief instructions appeared about purchasing tickets for this activity. Better personal relations with customers would help visitors feels more welcome. Would also recommend increased safety regulations for keeping kids in line and prevent them from pushing others. Scant safety",
          "Transport in Georgia requires a card that you load money onto for this tramway, but also for the Metro etc. The card costs 2 Gel and then you load the money on the same card for your whole group. There is a card 'top-up' machine at the bottom cable car Station and a one way",
          "The whole city is visible and its really very stable. We had experienced an aerial tram in the past in a different place but this one was much better. It was a joy to watch the city from such a height.",
          "Very modern and clean. Great way to view the city . 2 Gel a trip round trip. Night or day a very pleasant ride and view",
          "The line for the tramway at first seems never ending, with people wantonly ignoring common decency and cutting ahead. Once you get to the ticket lady it's CASH ONLY. 2GEL for a card, 2.5GEL per person per direction, so up down is 5GEL per person. There is no good view of the",
          "Make sure to take the tramway from the bottom first, less traffic. Buy tickets at the entrance and you have to push your way around as everyone gets over excited to get in and take pictures. The slops is impressive and the view of the city is splendid. At the top the restaurants",
          "It only costs 5 Gel, with a metro money card. The line was a bit long when we visited in the early afternoon. But, this makes sense given the reasonable price. The ropeway is the means to visit the Narikala and the statue of the mother of Georgians. But, I think the experience",
          "We were on a private tour and our guide insisted we take the Tram against my recommendation to walk to the top.",
          "Go early or late to avoid lines The aerial tram gives a great view and offers the possibility to walk through the botanical garden or see mother Georgia",
          "Despite of being crowded, the queue goes fast. Cheap I took it several times (daytime and night) the view from up there is really fabulous for greenlands and the city. From there you can go to the botanical garden and take pictures at the mother of georgia. I recommend going",
          "The aerial tramway is a must visit sight during your visit to Georgia. The cost of it is 2.5 GEL for both ways. The card can be purshased at the site and an amount of approximtely 2 GEL is charged for the card itself. You may use the same card for all your folks and use it even",
          "easier than climbing all the way to Narikala, and a wonderful view over the city. it's not cheap, and there's sometimes a Queue. you need to buy a card and pay for the rid up & down.",
          "This is the typical way of reaching the botanical gardens. Though it's not only for this reason thay it should be taken. A ride at sunset is the most fascinating with the scene of Tbilisi lighting up.",
          "This is a must do when in Tbilisi. We hopped on to the cable car from Rike Park (3 GEL one way) and it took about 3 minutes to reach Narikala Fortress. The view of Tbilisi was absolutely stunning on the way up! (Not recommended if you are afraid of heights). From the Fortress",
          "Definitely go for amazing views. Take the tram way up (one way) and at the top there is a Zip line that you can use to get down. Highly recommend the Zip Line as once your down, you can walk through the botanical gardens, which are stunning.",
          "The flyway is very nicely positioned which brings you to probably one of the best spots at hill top. This has remains of old historic fort structures and very nicely developed walkways. The scenic beauty is unparall. The restaurant serves you some nice drinks to sip and enjoy.",
          "Although there as a big queue it didn't take too long to get the ticket and enter the cable car. In a sidenote, if don't yet have the money card, you'll need to get it here. The ride was good and the view great, as we got higher and further away from the city. If the weather is",
          "You can use this aerial tramway to reach the top, where you have the Narikala fortress and ways to reach Botanical garden too. Or you can use it the other way round too. The entrance at the bottom is near the bridge of Peace. It is a short ride (price 2.5 lari one way). There",
          "The cable way is a fast and comfortable way to travel to the Citadel, motherland statue and the botanical gardens. One wat trip is around 2,5 lari.",
          "Large queues for a ride lasting little over a minute but stunning views of the city resulted. Unfortunately we had to walk down due to the cable cars stopping for over 20 minutes. Definitely worth a trip.",
          "Offering panoramic views of the city, Aerial Tramway is a great place to get pictures. Be sure to carry a set of lens with your camera",
          "Tramway was our first trip at the city. It was ok. But I don't feel safe riding on it. There was no proper lock and safety inside the tram. They said it's only for 5 persons but we're more than that.",
          "The queue to the trailway was long, but it goes fast - about 10 minutes and we went. The views are incredible, especially in the night - this is the time to go there. Kolejka do kasy idzie szybko, w ok. 10 minut ju\u017c si\u0119 jedzie. Widoki s\u0105 pi\u0119kne, szczeg\u00f3lnie w nocy",
          "Well worth the cheap fare, we were there at opening time 1000hrs and there were no queues, take small notes coins if you intend to pay by cash. Views are good and give you a general layout of old city. Don't worry if you miss the photo ops great views from top. If you feel up to",
          "Well worth taking the cable car to get to the view point overlooking the spectacular gorge. Excellent views as you ascend but I would recommend walking back through the streets to get a good feel for the area.",
          "Don't ever miss experiencing Aerial Tramway in Tbilisi! It will give you a very good bird's eye view of the city.",
          "Tramway is a good way to explore the beauty of tbilisi. Long waiting but totally worth it.less waiting upthere.",
          "The aerial tramway is a nice way to get down or up Narikala fortress hill. Supposedly there is a wagon with glass floor - make sure to take that one for the best views on the Old City from above!",
          "The cable car from Rike Park to Narikala Fortress is mostly obsolete - save for the view of Old Town - with a mountain of walking to do at the top to get to whichever attraction (fortress, Mother of Georgia statue, botanical gardens) you\u2019re aiming for. And there\u2019s a pile of",
          "Nice quiet retreat over the city with a sweeping view. There's even an amusement park at the top end to spend time at along with a balcony restaurant.",
          "if you want to have a panoramic view then this is the place. it is the best way to reach mother Georgia. it has god price but short also. it is a must in Tbilisi. you can reach many things above as botanical garden and other touristic stops. there is also",
          "Not really much to say abut this. The tramway takes you up to top of the hill where there is the statue and old fort. The view on the way up and down is good. Of L2.5 each way good value. It can be very hot up the top, and there is only on small cafe.",
          "Amazing view, cheap ticket of tram. What a nice attraction to go up and down. The best is to try during the day and during the night. You can see different panoramic views. Its just simply FANTASTIC!",
          "This is the only way I know of to access Narikala Fortress. The cars start running at 10:00 AM and the fee consists of 2 things: 2 or so Lari for a card and another 2 or so Lari for the ride. Once you get to the top, you keep the card and then pay another 2'ish Lari for the ride",
          "It takes only a couple of minutes to go up to the top with this cable car. Unbeatable views of Tbilisi. The Mother of Georgia statue is there as well. It is possible to walk down and it will take you merely 10 min. well worth the 2 GEL it costs to take a ride.",
          "The distance they carry you is short but the view of tbilisi is nice and you can go down by walking and see other attractions like Narikala. There were a zip line and a place to see botanical garden on the top , The cabins are big and comfortable.",
          "The best time to use the cable car is every time :) My advice is to buy one way ticket during day. Use cable car to get upstairs to the walls, enjoy a view and go downstairs by foot. Visit ruins and local sulfur baths. The second time, buy back ticket (better to say credit for",
          "You need to know that you will be waiting in a long que in order to get in tram..but it worth be waiting ....you can see tbilisi from above and will visit the Mother of tbilisi and see the statue of her closely",
          "The Aerial Tram way starts from Tram way station in the Rike Park and ends near entrance to Botanical Garden. The travel time is about Two minutes and costs 2.5 / 3 Lari (One way). You can capture great views of old Tbilisi as you go up. From the top you can go to Cartlis Deda",
          "Nothing special and yet very nice short ride that allows you coming fast up the hill to the Nariqala ruins/botanical garden, and at the same time enjoying the view of the city. We went up just before the sunset and it was the best time to enjoy the view. Not very expensive,",
          "To say that it's nothing more than a short ride with good views misses the point. Both those things are correct, but it's not a criticism; the ride is very cheap and, ultimately, it seems to be aimed more at Georgians as a practical route to reach the Narikala Fortress than it",
          "This cannot be compared with other cable cars round the world. The ride gets over in hardly a minute and there is not much to do above the hill apart from shopping. There are not many things to do in Tbilisi hence this has to be one of the standard tourist attractions.",
          "The ride with the aerial tramway offers great views and is really cheap. The only drawback is that it is over too quickly ;-)",
          "We did the ride while it was getting dark and it was one of the best experience in Tbilisi. The lights in the castle and other building with the reflection on the river made it look like Disneyland. Night is the best time to go on the tramway.",
          "Lovely ride, very cheap 2.5 GEL each way (or one way) and 2 GEL for the card which can be refunded after. Nice to get the cable car up and walk down, it isn't too far.",
          "Nice way to see the city. Ride is short but takes you over Old Town. Goes both ways or you can walk down. Very cheap.",
          "It was really relaxing ! It was nice to see the tbilisi from above and enjoy the view !!! Just wear something casual !up there were some resturant u can enjoy",
          "the 2 way ticket is 7 lari and the one way trip takes about 2-3 minutes . on the hill side there was no any personnel to check that the doors are closed for safety !!! that is awful really .",
          "It is a short trip. The cable car can accommodate 8 slim people and 6 not so slim people! As it does not stop, you need to hop in and hop off fast. The view at the top is lovely. It is good to access the fortress on top in the evening to get a view before and after sunset.",
          "The tramway starting point is in Rike Park not far from Peace Bridge and opens at 10am. This is a great way to get a fantastic view of the city. Going early helps to avoid the lines and the lighting is better for photos. The needed metro card can be bought while buying the",
          "Best place to see the areal view of old Tbilisi. Catch the cable car in the evening and spend 2 - 3 hrs.",
          "You must do this while in Tbilisi. There is no better view and no better way to get a quick overview of the city. It is part of their municipal transit system and thus, a fair price for a round trip. The gondola cars are clean and new and in excellent mechanic shape. Upon",
          "Easy to access Not pricey Clean and comfy Kind staff Very nice panorama Depend on season you may wait for the queue",
          "This is a nice ride which gives you great view to the city. I went up the hill on foot, exploring the beautiful alleys of the old town, and then bought a ticket to the Rike Park for my way back. It is a short ride (maybe 5 minutes tops), but it's cool. The price is 2 GEL for",
          "This is my first visit of Georgia and in the first date, I decided to go to the Kartlis Deda and the Telecabin near that. One thing that I shocked was the Telecabin\u2019s staff behavior. If they acted like thief, don\u2019t excite. Too much rude and impolite. I\u2019m sorry for that",
          "the trip is not dangerous for the second time. but for the first time... if you afraid of heights. but anyway.. don.t miss it",
          "Ok it\u2019s a cable car, but it takes you from the top of the city , crossing the river to land you effortlessly in a modern park on the other side. You get to see the wonders of the city, the ruins, the churches, synagogues, hotels, monuments, and presidents palace and everything",
          "If your in Tbilisi than must go to this place . Aerial Tramway is best place to Tbilisi city , River View n beautiful architecture of the city .",
          "The view is good. Plz carry either local currency or tourist cards available at the airport. No foreign currency or credit cards accepted at this place. Plz don't get disappointed, when they don't accept credit cards or foreign currencies.",
          "I have been here with family few days ago and the view of this place over the city is just amazing and there is lots to do.",
          "This is how you get to the Fortress the Mosque and the Hot Spring Baths. Take an extra few minutes and walk to the falls.",
          "The best view of Tbilisi. The carts are nice and you have a great view as you go up the hill. The cost are low(10GEL) for two people return. Can recommend it",
          "Breathtaking viewpoint over Tbilisi old town, great view at night. Also possible to get there on foot. We got there by aerial tram, and listened to street musician singing. Very romantic atmosphere!",
          "Went up to see the fort and statue. Great views both sides and plenty of ice cream including home made with liquid nitrogen. Also worth walking down into old Tiblisi rather than getting the cable car back to the other side of the river.",
          "Each unit can take up to 8 people. I was lucky that in the one I took we were only 5. A beautiful and relaxing ride to the top. I chose to walk on the way down.",
          "Tram cost was economical. I think it was 1.5 Lori (?) Each way but must buy the metro card. Great view of the city. Other than that not much more to say.",
          "We went up the cableway after a trip down the river by boat. Trip was quick and we did not have to wait long on either of the trips. View from the top was nice but I was not overwhelmed by it.",
          "It is well organized and looks safe. The coworkers help you friendly to get in. The view is amazing! (See photo) Wouldn't suggest for older people though, coz you have to get in and out while it's moving!",
          "I would say that this is a must to do in Tbilisi even if you are short of time. No queues, not expansive, quick way to reach the hill with nice view, especially old city places. We have taken ride down also, to spare a time.",
          "Get there around 10am and there will be no queue. It's 2.5 GEL for a ride and you will have to purchase one of the travel cards 2 GEL. Take a single ride up and walk down! worth it",
          "It\u2019s just amazing view! Better at night, but recommend to try both.. day and night to see the difference. Its just few min ride, but still amazing!",
          "The views from this cable car are very nice. The cabins are clean and safe and the ride saves you from a very steep walk up the hill.",
          "The ride itself is around 5 mins maximum, but well worth it for the small fee. Although I would recommend walking up to the Narikala Fortress, this mode of transport to get to the top does also give good views of Tbilisi.",
          "This is one of the easiest ways to have a magnificent view over Old (Dzveli) Tbilisi & almost whole city skyline. Lower point to catch this Cable Car is in Rike Park, just across The Bridge of Peace or Metekhi Bridge from the heart of old town & upper located just next to",
          "We first walked to the cable car station around 12.00 but the queues seemed to be fairly long with what seemed like a steady stream of your groups arriving. Going back at around 16.00 there were no queues at all. The fare of 2.5 GEL (each way) is good value and you need to load",
          "The best way to go to Narikala Fortress. Breathtaking view of Tbilisi. The duration of the ride is approximately 3 minutes. Low cost.",
          "This is a short walk from the centre of the city. The ticket was (I think) 7.60 Gel). Beware of queues from tourist buses. Return seemed quite easy and I think you can walk back down if you wish.",
          "A cool and friendly city with very affordable prices food and beverages 24/7 taxi tour guys or girls everything available in this town the best wine bar also you can buy 3-5 lt wines with a very small money weather amazing we like it so much we recommend for everyone to visit",
          "Although it takes around five minutes from take off till destination, it offers a nice aerial view of the heart of Tbilisi. It's a perfect option to take if you want to go to the Mother of Georgians statue and Narikala fort. For photographers: it is one of three spots where you",
          "The tramway gives lovely views of the city on the way up to see Mother Georgia. My only complaint? Too quick!",
          "The view is amazing, unfortunately too short in time. Tbilisi has many angles and this is one worth seeing.",
          "It is very rare that you can find a cable car in the very center of the city, but as you can see in Tbilisi, it's possible. Everyone should try - the views are breathtaking. It's very chip - but it is very nice attraction. On the top is a castle and restaurant and souvenirs",
          "Wonderful views of Tblisi. At the top are souvenir stands and the mother of Georgia, we strolled back through the streets of the old City.",
          "You go up, can have a nice view from the old part of the city! Up there you can see and visit the botanic garden and the fortress!!",
          "Excellent view from top of the hill. All big structures are very clearly view and enjoyable. Along with infant is little difficult.",
          "Easily the best way to visit the fortress guarding the old city of tblisi. Cheap and simple to use. Would recommend",
          "A quick ride takes you near to the old walls and a view of the city. We walked down. There are two options, one along the old wall and the other through the botanical gardens and by the baths. Perhaps you might consider walking along the upper part of the old wall and",
          "It is a short way cable car but the sightseeing is valuable experience. You can visit Narinkala and mother statue up the hills.",
          "Everybody who is scared to walk up the easy way to the castle of Tbilisi. Nice few above the old city of Tbilisi.",
          "This is a very organized and new Aerial Tramway, we had no problems, path is sort but we had a great view of the old city below us. Also we enjoyed the destination which is one of the tallest points of the town with view.",
          "Every thing was good. just be careful about the people who are there and force you to take a photo with their peacocks and parrots and then take money from you",
          "Great view of the city. Definitively is worth doing along with funicular, which gives you another opportunity to see Tbilisi from up above.",
          "Thought while in tblisi to visit the amusement park near tv tower. To get there you need to use the aerial tramway. The park itself is almost abandoned. The rides not being used. Boredom kicked in real fast. I wouldn't visit again as it really wasnt fun and most of walking was",
          "Use your metro card to make things easy. There\u2019s not too much at the top except for some great views. You can walk up instead but I recommend taking the cable car up and walk down. Enjoy!",
          "Great view of the city and an easy way to the fortress from the other side - for $1 who is not going to do this",
          "Actually there is a little way to the destination. It takes only 5 min but it is worth trying! I loved seeing the view of Tbilisi from the top.",
          "Nicely maintained ride.. you can reach to see Kartlis deda.. long queue for the ride.. Nice view when you reach at the top.. prefer to walk down rather than taking the ride..",
          "Although it is a short trip, but this trip gives you a very beautiful view of the city of Tbilisi from above!",
          "A cable train to the top of the mountain over the city was built by Belgian company over a century ago. The car is modern though. \ud83d\ude0a Great view over the city. Highly recommend to try Adjari khachapuri and donuts with cream at the top station restaurant. Nice park for a walk, a",
          "This would surely be in must visit list for any duration of visit . You have to walk across Bridge of Peace , in the rike park . You need to take a MetroMoney Card(same card for Metro) for 2 GEL, One visit costs 2.5 GEL per person . You have to visit once at day where you could",
          "Had a half day to explore from a business conference I was attending. Took this up to the Narikala Fortress. It was very cheap (I think around $5) and the views from the top are amazing.",
          "Good way to get to Mother of Georgia monument. Nice view from top and one can shop for souvenirs on top. We walked our way back through the fort and sulphur baths. You can also zipline to botanical gardern.",
          "We walked up from the old town \u2018spa\u2019 area to the castle and statue of Mother Georgia. The cable car was a convenient and visually pleasant way back down. It\u2019s was 5 Lari each and you also get a travel card which can then be used and topped up for other transport in the city.",
          "The tram is a short ride with no extra view apart from getting closer to the rooftops of the old city (beautiful). It is not worth the wait and cost. If you are fit enough for the somewhat steep 15 minute walk then that will provide you better views than the equally long line",
          "If there is just one thing to do in Tbilisi, this would be it. Gives excellent view of the city and Old Town and saves you the trek up to Narikala fort and Mother Georgia. Can get crowded on holidays though.",
          "Lovely view...Good service .... moneys worth!!!! Went in the afternoon......and came back at night.... Superb view!!!",
          "Definitely worth doing while in Tbilisi. Costs 2.5 lari one way plus 2 lari for an e-card if you don't have one. Less than a 5 minute ride but great views from the top. By the time you have walked to the fortress you're half way down to the old town so it's not really worth",
          "This is the easiest and I thin most interesting way to get to the Narikala fortress. From there I recommend to descent by foot to the sulfur bathhouses.",
          "We did a day tour by ourselves...start walking from Liberty Square...passing old and beautiful street...pass over the river by peace bridge and then from the Tram Station to the top...It has a long queue but move very fast...you should buy a transport card and charge it for the",
          "One way ride costs 2.5 Lari and an additional cost of 2 lari for the card which can be returned and refunded with original receipt. This card can be used in the metro and bus too with a cost of 0.5 Lari per ride irrespective of the distance travelled. Note that this card cannot",
          "Suggestion to walk up to the church & statue of mother Georgia and use the cable cart coming down. Why; only few cabins being used so its a long wait for a 2 minutes ride (100+ people queuing in the off-season). Hike up is not so strenuous (20-30 min walk) and quite nice",

          "Aerial Tramway in Tbilisi city center A good aerial view of the city center Have a camera with you It's a short visit",
          "Ok so we waited for around 20 minutes or more to board the cable car, during which time we were hasteled to give money to beggars, and to buy dodgy perfume! There was also live music playing by 2 men with guitars! However, for the few Lari it cost, it was well worth it.",
          "Good concept. Waited 30 min for the ride, but some street musicians played while we waited so it was not so bad. Will not do it again, the ride lasts for less that 1 min and the fortress is easily reached by walking.",
          "A good afternoon out. Beautiful views from the top. You can see the mother of tbillisi from the top.",
          "This is a good way to get a good view of Old Tbilisi. The travel up towards the mountain is very smooth and safe I loved the aerial view of the city. Beware of the vendors on the entrance with the animals. They charge too much for pictures.",
          "That aerial transport is part of Tbilisi transport system. Only for 2.5 lari you can get to top of the mount. The ride takes approximately 3-4 minutes.",
          "Very nice place with good views, safe, with a stop to the church and Pantheon! Ticket purchase a little complicated as you have to buy a card and deposit money on it but it works easily!",
          "Was scared to ride at first however the mulled wine and chacha settled my nerves Came a couple of days latter and there was musicians at bottom a great experiance in such a great city. Beautiful honest city with many five star attractions many free or of little cost this is 2.5",
          "When you buy tickets for this ride buy cards that too seperate for each family member. One card costs 2 gel each ; it\u2019s better to have seperate cards. This card will work for all your journeys in Tbilisi incl bus, train, subway and cable car ( excl vertical train at funicular",
          "That was fun,everyone should try it for once i think! On the top you can see a great view of tbilisi,but there is no other interesting thing up there",
          "beware of the tourist guides and the stalin who'll be welcoming you there!! tourist trap alert.. you can just buy your ticket and take the cable car ride on your own.. between time yourself a bit, so that you can probably can get your own car!!",
          "We were walking around rike park and saw the entrance of the aerial tramway. and we tried it. we paid 17 GEL for 3 pax and they just let us enter the cable car and it started moving. The view is amazing. Inside the the cable car we get to see the view of Tbilisi in 360\u00b0 angle",
          "We took a night view on this tramway and it is worth seeing it, please do not miss it, we had a great time",
          "We were lucky with the weather. Clear and sunny even if the fresh air was in a hurry! Well worth a visit with spectacular views from the car and at the top. The adjoining castle/fort was also interesting. Definitely a must when in Tbilisi",
          "I think it\u2019s the best way to go up the hill if you are planing to visit the National botanical garden of Georgia. A return trip costs 7 GL. The view along the way is amazing .",
          "Ride only last a few mins but is stunning. You have to purchase a plastic credit card style pass to ride it (like londons oyster card) you then top up the card with each person's fare... The card can be given back on completion of a form and showing your passport (but seeing as",
          "I really liked it so much. Very nice view from town. In fact very nice journey up there. You can see whole city from there. You should be there when visit Tbilisi",
          "Absolutely loved it. Only wished it was longer. I went on 9th & 10th March, it was empty which was absolutely awesome. Day and night and both times were magical and the best way to view the city and so much to discover by just viewing the city. Don't go summer time. The queues",
          "It opens up an amazing view to tibilisi, from the top you can discover some of the most important monuments in Georgia. Recommended",
          "For 5 Lari you get a great view from the top and a ride to Nicola fortress , waterfall the botanical garden , we spent like 2 hours or more a bit there and it was really nice , pick a sunny day with good weather and it\u2019s really the best way to see most of the city from the top ,",
          "Enjoy this ride for the best views overlooking Tbilisi, and visit for Virgin Mary. Take some photos of the view and Narikala fortress, perfect for couples or families",
          "Is a must in Tbilisi. The attraction is old but same time it has an amazing view while you go up. Also there is a possibility to walk amongst the nature on the top and enjoy the views also. Don\u2019t miss a chance to visit s church there.",
          "It was amazing and my daughter liked it much. A must thing to do in old city. You may opt for one way or return trip.",

          "It's integral part of city transport system. It cost 2 GEL plastic card itself and shall be loaded 5 GEL if you want only to use rope tram up and down. However to get down by foot takes 10 minutes only on quite steep downhill.",
          "Modern and safe, not expansive, you can visit highest ground place in Tbilisi very fast with fun! in combination like town site seeing it is must visit!",
          "This is a very handy way of getting to the top of the mountain. The old bus is absolutely awful this a great cheap and quick way to get up and down",

          "The cable cars going up to narikala, kartlis deda is short more expensive and you might need to wait quite some time in line. But the city views is worth it. I prefer the cable car going up to mtatminda which I use as a transport mean when i want to get the famous traditional",
          "One of the nicest places in Tibilisi. I really enjoyed the nice view of the city. The ride was short but fun. A two way ticket costs 5 Gel but you should pay 2 gel extra for a plastic card which can be returned. The statue of mother of Georgia was beautiful and huge. So this is",
          "Definitely worth taking a trip up on the cable car. Very cheap, fast and exciting way to see Tbilisi. We walked back down but you can get cable car back as well if you want. Views from the top are great and it takes you to see the mama Georgia statue, botanical gardens, zip",

          "It goes through one of the most beautiful landscape of buildings. The only issue which made me upset was short trip time. It would be greate if they can make it slower so visitors have more time to enjoy the view",
          "It's a beautiful activity and you can see the city from above ! The view is fantastic ! You should definitely try it !",
          "Great view, nice old ruins and castle of old. A bit unsafe for people going off track. But so much fun still!",
          "It was one of the must visit and experience one should have while visiting Tbilisi as gives you beautiful visual treat from the top giving the blend of heritage and modern architecture of the city. Relative to other ropeways it is short in distance but worth it",
          "They was a fun quick trip even though it was a rainy day. The views were beautiful and the fog and mist added a certain mystical atmosphere to the day. If you have time take a ride up and then walk down to old town.",
          "The scenery of the Game of Thrones is one comparison when one views Tbilisi and monumental history from up there. One needs to buy a universal public transport card for 2 levi, that is 0,6 EUR, no pain at all.",

          "This is not really made only for tourist, but used by the locals too as it belongs to the transportation company. It is relatively more expensive than the bus or metro fare. You will have to first buy a rechargable card (can be used for the bus and metro) and load it with",

          "Yes a tourist trap both ends of the trip but worth the effort. Great views over the city and good value. Journey takes around 5 minutes each way. At the summit excellent views and some historical sights as well as the usual hawkers looking for business but don't let that put you",
          "Well, it's just a cable car, but this one runs over the sole city center, from the Rike Park over the river, up to Narikala fortress over the entire old town. Views are spectacular so get your camera ready. I suggest taking a one way ride only, upwards from the Rike Park to",

          "If you can spend half an hour queueing, it is nice to discover the city from the top, visit the Goergian's Mother and Narikala Fortress. What I recomed is also finish walking at the Botanical Garden",

        "wiki": "Ananuri (Georgian: \u10d0\u10dc\u10d0\u10dc\u10e3\u10e0\u10d8) is a castle complex on the Aragvi River in Georgia, about 45 miles (72 kilometres) from Tbilisi.\n\n\n== History ==\nAnanuri was a castle and seat of the eristavis (Dukes) of Aragvi, a feudal dynasty which ruled the area from the 13th century. The castle was the scene of numerous battles.\nIn 1739, Ananuri was attacked by forces from a rival duchy, commanded by Shanshe of Ksani and was set on fire. The Aragvi clan was massacred. However, four years later, the local peasants revolted against rule by the Shanshe, killing the usurpers and inviting King Teimuraz II to rule directly over them. However, in 1746, King Teimuraz was forced to suppress another peasant uprising, with the help of King Erekle II of Kakheti. The fortress remained in use until the beginning of the 19th century. In 2007, the complex has been on the tentative list for inclusion into the UNESCO World Heritage Site program.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe fortifications consist of two castles joined by a crenellated curtain wall. The upper fortification with a large square tower, known as Sheupovari, is well preserved and is the location of the last defense of the Aragvi against the Shanshe. The lower fortification, with a round tower, is mostly in ruins.\nWithin the complex, amongst other buildings, are two churches. The older Church of the Virgin, which abuts a tall square tower, has the graves of some of the Dukes of Aragvi. It dates from the first half of the 17th century, and was built of brick. The interior is no longer decorated, but of interest is a stone baldaquin erected by the widow of the Duke Edishera, who died in 1674.\nThe larger Church of the Mother of God (Ghvtismshobeli), built in 1689 for the son of Duke Bardzim. It is a central dome style structure with richly decorated fa\u00e7ades, including a carved north entrance and a carved grapevine cross on the south fa\u00e7ade. It also contains the remains of a number of frescoes, most of which were destroyed by the fire in the 18th century.\n\n\n== References ==\nRosen, Roger. Georgia: A Sovereign Country of the Caucasus.

        "wiki": "Tbilisi (English:  t\u0259-bih-LEE-see, t\u0259-BIL-ih-see; Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 [t\u02b0bilisi] (listen)), in some countries also still known by its pre-1936 international designation, Tiflis ( TIF-lis), is the capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of approximately 1.5 million people. Tbilisi was founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire, Tbilisi was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy, governing both Southern and Northern Caucasus.\nBecause of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global powers. The city's location to this day ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and the Modern structures.\nHistorically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though it is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Its notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from 20 to 32 \u00b0C (68 to 90 \u00b0F) in the summer and 7 to \u22121 \u00b0C (45 to 30 \u00b0F) in the winter.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe name Tbilisi derives from Old Georgian t\u2032bilisi (Asomtavruli: \u10b2\u10a1\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8\u10b1\u10a8, Mkhedruli: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8), and further from tpili (Modern Georgian: \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8, 'warm', itself from Old Georgian: \u10b2\u10b4\u10a8\u10aa\u10a8 \u1e6dpili). The name T\u2032bili or T\u2032bilisi (literally, 'warm location') was therefore given to the city because of the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs.\nUntil 1936, the name of the city in English and most other languages was Tiflis, while the Georgian name was \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 (Tpilisi).On 17 August 1936, by order of the Soviet leadership, the official Russian names of various cities were changed to more closely match the local language. In addition, the Georgian-language form T\u2032pilisi was modernized on the basis of a proposal by Georgian linguists; the ancient Georgian component \u10e2\u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (tpili, 'warm') was replaced by the newer \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 (t\u2032bili). This form was the basis for a new official Russian name (\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438 Tbilisi).  Most other languages have subsequently adopted the new name form, but some languages such as Turkish, Persian, Greek, and German have retained a variation of Tiflis.\nOn 20 September 2006, the Georgian parliament held a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the renaming.\nSome of the traditional names of Tbilisi in other languages of the region have different roots.  The Ossetian name \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a (Kalak) derives from the Georgian word \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e5\u10d8 (kalaki) meaning simply 'town'. Chechen and Ingush names for the city use a form similar to or the same as their names for the country of Georgia (\u0413\u0443\u044c\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0445 G\u00fcr\u01b6ex) as does the historical Kabardian name (\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0434\u0436\u044b Kwrd\u017e\u0259), while Abkhaz \u049a\u0430\u0440\u04ad (\u0136ar\u0163) is from the Mingrelian \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8 (Karti).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi since the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age. During the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus. According to legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted variant of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King Vakhtang I of Iberia (r. c. 447/49 \u2013 502/22) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either a hawk or other small birds of prey in the legend). The King's falcon allegedly caught or injured a pheasant during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died from burns. King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and build a city on the location.\nKing Dachi of Iberia (r. 522\u2013534), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved the capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries. From the 6th century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region's strategic location along important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.\n\n\n=== Foreign domination ===\n\nTbilisi's favorable trade location, however, did not necessarily bode well for its survival. Located strategically in the heart of the Caucasus between Europe and Asia, Tbilisi became an object of rivalry among the region's various powers such as the Roman Empire, Parthia, Sassanid Persia, Muslim Arabs, the Byzantine Empire, and the Seljuk Turks. The cultural development of the city was somewhat dependent on who ruled the city at various times, although Tbilisi was fairly cosmopolitan.\nFrom 570\u2013580, the Persians ruled the city until 627, when Tbilisi was sacked by the Byzantine/Khazar armies and later, in 736\u2013738, Arab armies entered the town under Marwan II. After this point, the Arabs established an emirate centered in Tbilisi. In 764, Tbilisi \u2013 still under Arab control \u2013 was once again sacked by the Khazars. In 853, the armies of Arab leader Bugha Al-Turki invaded Tbilisi in order to enforce its return to Abbasid allegiance. The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050. In 1068, the city was once again sacked, only this time by the Seljuk Turks under Sultan Alp Arslan.\n\n\n=== Capital of Georgia ===\nIn 1121, after heavy fighting with the Seljuks, the troops of the King of Georgia David IV of Georgia besieged Tbilisi, which ended in 1122 and as a result David moved his residence from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified Georgian State and thus inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age. From 12\u201313th centuries, Tbilisi became a regional power with a thriving economy and astonishing cultural output. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and a cultural center not only for Georgia but for the Eastern Orthodox world of the time. During Queen Tamar's reign, Shota Rustaveli worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. This period is often referred to as \"Georgia's Golden Age\" or the Georgian Renaissance.\n\n\n=== Mongol domination and the following period of instability ===\nTbilisi's \"Golden Age\" did not last for more than a century. In 1226, Tbilisi was captured by the Khwarezmian Empire Shah Jalal ad-Din and its defences severely devastated and prone to Mongol armies. In 1236, after suffering crushing defeats to the Mongols, Georgia came under Mongol domination. The nation itself maintained a form of semi-independence and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi was strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols retreated from Georgia and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state once again. An outbreak of the plague struck the city in 1366.\nFrom the late 14th until the end of the 18th century, Tbilisi came under the rule of various foreign invaders once again and on several occasions was completely burnt to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was invaded by the armies of Tamerlane. In 1444, the city was invaded and destroyed by Jahan Shah (the Shah of the town of Tabriz in Persia). From 1477 to 1478 the city was held by the Ak Koyunlu tribesmen of Uzun Hassan.\n\n\n=== Iranian control ===\n\nAs early as the 1510s, Tbilisi (and the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) were made vassal territories of Safavid Iran. In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force. Following the death of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524), king David X of Kartli expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards. With the 1555 Treaty of Amasya, and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of vali. Under the later rules of Teimuraz II and Heraclius II, Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule\u2014but, fearful of the constant threat of invasion, Georgia's rulers sought Russian protection in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Despite this agreement, the city was captured and devastated in 1795 by the Iranian Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, who sought to re-establish Iran's traditional sovereignty over the region.\n\n\n=== Russian control ===\n\nIn 1801, the Russian Empire annexed the Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (of which Tbilisi was the capital), later cementing its rule with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, which ended Iranian control of Georgia. Tbilisi became the center of the Tbilisi Governorate (Gubernia). Russian Imperial administrators implemented a new European-style city plan and commissioned new buildings in Western styles. Roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in the Russian Empire, such as Batumi and Poti. By the 1850s, Tbilisi once again emerged as a major trade and a cultural center. The likes of Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Iakob Gogebashvili, Alexander Griboyedov and many other statesmen, poets and artists all found their home in Tbilisi. The city was visited on numerous occasions by and was the object of affection of Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov, the Romanov family and others. The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day Rustaveli Avenue), on which the Viceroys of the Caucasus established their residence. For much of the 19th century, Tbilisi's largest ethnic group was Armenian, who, at some point, formed 74.3% of the population.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Brief independence ===\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city served as a location of the Transcaucasus interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent Transcaucasian Federation with the capital in Tbilisi. At this time, Tbilisi had roughly the same number of Armenians as Georgians, with Russians being the third largest ethnic group. It was here, in the former Caucasus Vice royal Palace, where the independence of three Transcaucasus nations \u2013 Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2013 was declared on 26 to 28 May 1918. After this, Tbilisi functioned as the capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until 25 February 1921. From 1918 to 1919 the city was also consecutively home to a German and British military headquarters.\nUnder the national government, Tbilisi turned into the first Caucasian University City after the Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918. On 25 February 1921, the Bolshevist Russian 11th Red Army invaded Tbilisi and after bitter fighting at the outskirts of the city, declared Soviet rule.\n\n\n=== Soviet rule ===\n\nIn 1921, the Democratic Republic of Georgia was occupied by the Soviet Bolshevik forces from Russia, and until 1936 Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the Transcaucasian SFSR (which included Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), and afterwards until 1991 as the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized, and it also came to be an important political, social, and cultural centre of the Soviet Union. In 1980 the city housed the first state-sanctioned rock festival in the USSR. As a major tourist destination for both Soviet citizens and foreign visitors, Tbilisi's \"Old Town\" (the neighborhoods within the original city walls) was reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s.Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the 9 March Massacre, in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of Nikita Khrushchev. Peaceful protests occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the April 9 tragedy was a peaceful protest that turned violent.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nSince the break-up of the Soviet Union, Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war, which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-Gamsakhurdia and Opposition forces clashed), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations among various mafia clans and illegal business operators. Even during the Shevardnadze Era (1993\u20132003), crime and corruption became rampant at most levels of society. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the Rose Revolution. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with decreasing crime rates, an improved economy, and a real estate boom. During the 2008 South Ossetia war, the Tbilisi area was hit by multiple Russian air attacks.\nAfter the war, several large-scale projects were started, including a streetcar system, a railway bypass and a relocation of the central station, and new urban highways. In June 2015, a flood killed at least twelve people and caused animals from the city's zoo to be released into the streets.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\nThe status of Tbilisi, as the nation's capital, is defined by the Article 10 in the Constitution of Georgia (1995) and the Law on Georgia's Capital \u2013 Tbilisi (20 February 1998).Tbilisi is governed by the Tbilisi City Assembly (Sakrebulo) and the Tbilisi City Hall (Meria). The City Assembly and mayor are elected once every four years by direct elections. The Mayor of Tbilisi is Kakha Kaladze and the Chairman of the Tbilisi city Assembly is Giorgi Alibegashvili.\n\nAdministratively, the city is divided into raions (districts), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general subdivision of the Soviet Union. Since Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:\n\nMtatsminda District Including Neighborhoods: Mtatsminda, Sololaki, Vera, Kiketi, Kojori, Shindisi, Tsavkikisi, Tabakhmela\nVake District Including Neighborhoods: Vake, Bagebi, Vazha Pshavela Quarters, Nutsubidze Plateau, Tskneti\nSaburtalo District Including Neighborhoods: Delisi, Vedzisi, Vashlijvari, Bakhtrioni, Khiliani, Didi Dighomi, Zurgovana\nKrtsanisi District Including Neighborhoods: Kala, Ortachala, Ponichala\nIsani District Including Neighborhoods: Avlabari, Navtlughi, Metromsheni, Vazisubani, Eighth Legioni\nSamgori District Including Neighborhoods: Varketili, Third Array, Orkhevi, Dampalo, Lilo, Lower Samgori\nChughureti District Including Neighborhoods: Chughureti, Kukia, Svanetisubani\nDidube District Including Neighborhoods: Didube, Didghomi Massive\nNadzaladevi District Including Neighborhoods: Nadzaladevi, Sanzona, Temka, Lotkini, Old Nadzaladevi\nGldani District Including Neighborhoods: Gldani Massive, Avchala, Mukhiani, GldanulaMost of the raions are named after historic quarters of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognise an informal system of smaller historic neighbourhoods. Such neighbourhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the Right Bank and the Left Bank of the Mt'k'vari. The names of the oldest neighbourhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.\nIn pre-Revolution Tiflis, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:\n\nIn the north part of the town, on the left bank of the Kur\u00e1 and to the south of the railway station, stretches the clean German Quarter, formerly occupied by German immigrants from W\u00fcrttemberg (1818). To the south is the Gruzinian or Georgian Quarter (Avlab\u00e1r). On the right bank of the Kur\u00e1 is the Russian Quarter, the seat of the officials and of the larger business firms. This is adjoined on the south by the Armenian and Persian Bazaars.\nAvlabari is considered \"the integral component of the so-called 'old Tbilisi'\" and is the object of planning and cultural heritage preservation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nTbilisi is located in the South Caucasus at 41\u00b0 43' North Latitude and 44\u00b0 47' East Longitude. The city lies in Eastern Georgia on both banks of the Mt'k'vari River. The elevation of the city ranges from 380\u2013770 metres above sea level (1,250\u20132,530 ft) and has the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the Saguramo Range, to the east and south-east by the Iori Plain, to the south and west by various endings (sub-ranges) of the Trialeti Range.\nThe relief of Tbilisi is complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Mt'k'vari River extends for more than 30 km (19 mi) from the Avchala District to River Lochini. The part of the city which lies on the right side of the Mt'k'vari River, on the other hand, is built along the foothills of the Trialeti Range, the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river Mt'k'vari. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on the right bank of the Mt'k'vari River. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.\nTo the north of the city, there is a large reservoir (commonly known as the Tbilisi Sea) fed by irrigation canals.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTbilisi has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with considerable continental and semi-arid influences. The city experiences very warm summers and moderately cold winters. Like other regions of Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry period. The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and oceanic (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) and the fact that the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild microclimate compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.\nThe average annual temperature in Tbilisi is 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). January is the coldest month with an average temperature of 2.3 \u00b0C (36.1 \u00b0F). July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24.9 \u00b0C (76.8 \u00b0F). Daytime high temperatures reach or exceed 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) on an average of 22 days during a typical year.  The absolute minimum recorded temperature is \u221224.4 \u00b0C (\u221211.9 \u00b0F) in January 1883 and the absolute maximum is 42.0 \u00b0C (107.6 \u00b0F) on 17 July 1882. Average annual precipitation is 495.5 mm (19.5 in). May is the wettest month (averaging 77.6 mm (3.1 in) of precipitation) while January is the driest (averaging 18.9 mm (0.7 in) of precipitation). Snow falls on average 15\u201325 days per year. The surrounding mountains often trap the clouds within and around the city, mainly during the Spring and Autumn months, resulting in prolonged rainy and/or cloudy weather. Northwesterly winds dominate in most parts of Tbilisi throughout the year. Southeasterly winds are common as well.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAs a multicultural city, Tbilisi is home to more than 100 ethnic groups. Around 89% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azerbaijanis. Along with the above-mentioned groups, Tbilisi is home to other ethnic groups including Ossetians, Abkhazians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Germans, Jews, Estonians, Kurds, Assyrians & Yazidis, and others.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nMore than 95% of the residents of Tbilisi practise some form of Christianity (the most predominant of which is the Georgian Orthodox Church). The Russian Orthodox Church, which is in Full communion with the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church have significant followings as well. A minority of the population (around 1.5%) practises Islam (mainly Shia Islam), while about 0.1% of Tbilisi's population practises Judaism. There is also a Roman Catholic church and the Yazidi Sultan Ezid Temple.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nUp until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding (polo in particular), wrestling, boxing, and marksmanship were the most popular city sports. Influence from the Russian Empire brought more Western sports and activities (billiards, fencing) to Tbilisi.\nThe Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary sports infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 handball arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the Dinamo Arena (55,000 seats) and the second largest is the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium (24,680 seats). The Sports Palace which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments can seat approximately 11,000 people.\nVere Basketball Hall is a smaller indoor sports arena with a 2,500 seating capacity.\nThe most popular sports in Tbilisi today are football, rugby union, basketball, and wrestling. Also, popular sports include tennis, swimming and water polo. There are several professional football and rugby teams as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. National Basketball Association players Zaza Pachulia and Nikoloz Tskitishvili are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.\nTbilisi's signature football team, Dinamo Tbilisi, has not won a major European championship since the 1980\u20131981 season, when it won the European UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the Euroleague in 1962 but also never repeated any such feat.\nTbilisi will host several Group Phase matches for the EuroBasket 2021 in the country, Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne) and Italy (Milan).\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe large majority of Georgia's media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular Rustavi 2 television channel which gained considerable fame after its coverage of the Rose Revolution. In addition to Rustavi 2, the remaining three out of the four major public television channels of Georgia (including Imedi TV Maestro and the Public Broadcasting Channel) are based in the city. Tbilisi's television market has experienced notable changes since the second half of 2005 when Rustavi 2 successfully bought out the Mze TV company and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation became a shareholder of Imedi Media Holding at the beginning of 2006.\nTbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily 24 Saati (\"24 Hours\"), Rezonansi (\"Resonance\"), Alia, the English-language daily The Messenger, weekly FINANCIAL, Georgia Today, and the English-language weekly The Georgian Times. Out of the city's radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 FM), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.\nRadio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and Byzantine, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Beaux-Arts, Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles. Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801\u20131917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.\nTbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically-inflected Stalinist architecture in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building (\"Imeli\"), now housing the Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi.[2]\n\nTbilisi's postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union's most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi's 1975 Ministry of Roads and the 1984 Wedding Palace. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout \"kamikaze loggia\" overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Soon Tbilisi will have three skyscraper complexes. The Axis Towers, Redix Chavchavadze 64, and the new Ajara Hotel/Business Complex, which is currently under construction, will be the tallest buildings/skyscrapers in the Caucasus.[3]\n\n\n=== Theatre, dance and music ===\n\nThe city has important theatre and music institutions, such as the Tbilisi State Conservatoire, the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Shota Rustaveli State Academic Theatre, and the Marjanishvili State Academic Theatre.\n\n\n=== Arts museums and galleries ===\nThe Georgian National Museum gathers several important museums, including the Art Museum of Georgia. The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 2012. Two independent contemporary art organisations, Kunsthalle Tbilisi and Open Space of Experimental Art, were founded in 2018.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\nTbilisi has important landmarks and sightseeing locations. The Parliament and the government (State Chancellery) buildings of Georgia, the Supreme Court of Georgia, the Sameba Cathedral, the Vorontsov's Palace (also known as the Children's Palace today), the National Public Library of the Parliament of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia, Tbilisi Circus, The Bridge of Peace, and many state museums are in Tbilisi. During the Soviet times, Tbilisi continuously ranked in the top four cities in the Soviet Union for the number of museums.\nOut of the city's historic landmarks, the most notable are the Narikala fortress (4th\u201317th century), Anchiskhati Basilica (6th century, built up in the 16th century), Sioni Cathedral (8th century, later rebuilt), and Church of Metekhi, Open Air Museum of Ethnography, Sulfur Bath, and Tbilisi Old City.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nBeyond traditional attractions, Tbilisi has developed burgeoning nightclub culture which started to attract international media attention in the 2010s. The leading clubs such as Bassiani, Mtkvarze, Khidi, and Caf\u00e9 Gallery have featured major international DJs as well as local performers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nWith a GDP at basic prices of 12,147 million Georgian lari (\u20ac4.3 billion) in 2014, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating almost 50 percent of Georgia's GDP. The service sector, including government services, is dominating and contributes 88 percent to GDP. Its GDP per capita of 10,336 Georgian lari (\u20ac3,600) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent. The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi's GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is \u2013 with 22.5 percent \u2013 significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nShota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport is Tbilisi's only international airport, located about 18 kilometres (11 miles) southeast of the city center. Handling 3.16 million passengers in 2017, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the seventeenth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56 million passengers in 11 months of 2018. It is a hub for the National carrier Georgian Airways and a Georgian-Chinese start-up Myway Airlines. \nAs of December 2018, various airlines serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as: London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Vienna, Paris, Doha etc.\nTbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first \"green airport\" in the Caucasus region in 2008.\nNatakhtari Airfield, located 33 km north of Tbilisi in the town of Natakhtari, is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to Batumi, Mestia and Ambrolauri.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tbilisi Metro serves the city with rapid transit subway services. It was the Soviet Union's fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966. The system operates two lines, the Akhmeteli-Varketili Line and the Saburtalo Line. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00 am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.\nThe third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and Tbilisi International Airport with a possible extension to Rustavi, 30 km east of Tbilisi.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nTbilisi had a tram network, since 1883 starting from horse-driven trams and from 25 December 1904 electric tramway. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, electric transport went to a degradation state within the years and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006 together with two trolleybus lines which were left. There are plans to construct a modern tram network.\n\n\n=== Minibus ===\nThe most dominant form of transportation is the minibus. An elaborate minibus system has grown in Tbilisi over the recent years. In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 tetri in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets, they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever he likes.\n\n\n=== Municipal bus ===\nThe second largest form of transportation are the municipal buses which are operated by Tbilisi Transport Company. As of October 2018, 672 buses of various size are servicing the city, majority of them are Ukrainian Bogdan A144 and A092 models along with 143 energy-efficient MAN Lion's City buses. New MAN Lion's City buses were put in service in 2017. Later in 2018, the tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta trucks&Buses won the tender and will be delivering aforementioned order in early 2019. In October 2018, at the Georgian Dream conference, it was announced that all the buses will be changed with new ones by the end of 2019, out of which 90 will be electric. Moreover, Kaladze asserted, that by 2020, Tbilisi will have 200 electric buses and the total number will reach 900.\n\n\n=== Aerial tramways ===\nHistorically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but all of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nSince 2012, Tbilisi has a modern, high-capacity gondola lift which operates between Rike Park and the Narikala fortress; each gondola can carry up to 8 persons. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner Ropeways.Since October 12, 2016, Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects Vake Park with Turtle Lake.\nSince October 2016, another Soviet-era aerial tramway between State University (Maglivi) and University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) is being reconstructed after 13 years of abandonment and is due for opening in April 2018. The original Italian-produced cabins produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti & Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, are being kept as well as the stations.\nDue to mismanagement at the hands of Soviet authorities, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.\n\n\n=== Funicular ===\nTbilisi funicular reopened 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built 1905, connecting Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park, and covering almost 300 m (980 ft) in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower as well as some amusement rides, including a roller-coaster and a ferris wheel.\nThe half-way station of the funicular is just a short way away from Mtatsminda Pantheon, providing easy access to the necropolis.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognised medical education system. The biggest Georgian university is Tbilisi State University which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region. Over 35,000 students are enrolled and the number of faculty and staff (collaborators) is approximately 5,000. Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in Caucasus region \u2013 Tbilisi State Medical University, which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since that university operates as an independent educational institution, TSMU became one of the high-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. There are almost 5000 undergraduate and 203 postgraduate students at the university of whom 10% come from foreign countries.\nGeorgia's main and largest technical university, Georgian Technical University, is in Tbilisi. Georgian Technical University was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by the world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It achieved University status by 1990. The three most popular private higher educational institution in Georgia \u2014The University of Georgia (Tbilisi), Caucasus University, and the Free University of Tbilisi \u2013 are in Tbilisi.\n\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi) is the largest private University in Georgia, with more than 3500 international and local students. It was established in 2005 and soon became a market leader within Georgian educational sector. In 2010, the UG received financing from OPIC (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) for a development of the University's infrastructure and technical equipment. The University of Georgia has various undergraduate and graduate programs and it's the first company in Georgia which offers international certificate programs of the Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Zend technologies and Cisco Academy.\nCaucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB) (established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA). The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through the merger of two higher education schools: European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA). Today Free University comprises three schools \u2014 Business School (ESM), Institute of Asia and Africa and Law School \u2014 delivering academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels. In addition, Free University conducts a wide array of short-term courses and runs several research centers and summer school programs.\nHigher educational institutions in Tbilisi:\n\nTbilisi State University\nIlia State University\nGeorgian Technical University\nTbilisi State Conservatory\nShota Rustaveli Theatre and Film University\nTbilisi State Academy of Arts\nThe University of Georgia (Tbilisi)\nTbilisi State Medical University\nCaucasus University\nCaucasus International University\nTbilisi Medical Academy\nFree University of Tbilisi\nGrigol Robakidze University \u2013 Alma Mater\nGeorgian American University\nInternational Black Sea University\nGeorgian Institute of Public Affairs\nAgricultural University of Georgia\nInternational School of Economics (ISET)\nThe University of Geomedi\nNew Vision University\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Living in Tbilisi ==\nTbilisi is home to many foreigners. The number of foreigners living and working in Tbilisi has risen in recent years together with the openings of international schools, businesses, expat's communities, and online networks. Tbilisi is a very safe city. Most of the expatriates are living in Vake, Vera, Saburtalo, and Dighomi. A lot of expatriate communities could be found in Tbilisi. Some of them are charging a membership fee.\nIWA, International Women Association  is a non profit organisation founded in 1996 and its members and participants are International and Georgian women.\nExpats in Tbilisi is an Online Support Network founded by UN and EU Staff Spouses in Georgia Country to support expatriates in finding information and all relevant resources in one place.\nInter-nation International\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTbilisi is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAbo Tbileli, the patron saint of Tbilisi\nBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline\nList of Tbilisians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\nPostcard from the Silk Road -(Georgia), TRAVELS \u2013 ESPECIALLY FOR \u201eZNAD WILII\u201d, Leonard Dro\u017cd\u017cewicz, \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d, Vie\u0161oji \u012fstaiga \u201eZnad Wilii\u201d kult\u016bros pl\u0117tros draugija,ISSN 1392-9712 indeks 327956 nr 1 (57) z 2014 r., pp. 87\u201398, (in Polish)http://www.znadwiliiwilno.lt/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Znad-Wilii-57m.pdf\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the City of Tbilisi",

          "We were here in September 2019 and this was the first place we headed. The entrance is quite easy to find and a short walk from one of the metro stations. You need a different card for this to the metro, but one card can be used for more than one person - so we bought one card",

          "We spent New Year's Eve in this restaurant! the view from the windows is great! the waiters are positive! the guests are beautiful! dinner is terrible! Wine is very budget friendly! transfer staff funicular rude! a total of $ 130 for this dubious pleasure is too",
          "Good, expansive views and a well run cable car. Recommended for your first day in this beautiful city.",
          "50m length Funicular takes you to the top of the mountain where you can find list of attractions for small children. But not recommended for young and teenage children. But the city view from there is very nice and you can make a walk around the park.",
          "You've done the cablecar - you really have to do the funicular. Go up one and down the other in your own preference. Great experience with kids.",
          "The funicular is a short walk around the bay of La Concha with Monte Igeldo located at the end. This cog railway with wooden carriages will take you from the lower slopes of the mountain to the fairground at the summit at minimal cost. It is the oldest funicular railway in the",
          "Enjoyable and quick although infrequent departures. Heaters on the seats! Go to the restaurant at the top for Donuts, yum, the fair ground is an added bonus. Good sights over the city especially at night.",
          "Sit, relax and travel up or down. Fresh air on top. Nice view and good to take pictures. Very very nice restaurant when you get there. Recommend a romantic breakie or dinner with local and traditional foods.",
          "Amazing vertical tram is the highlight. Try to hop on to the first cabin from the bottom and you will have amazing views while riding up the hill. And after reaching the top of the hill you will find amusement park with lots of fun activities for Kids.",
          "Easy going, fast and cheap way to get a great view over the city. For kids is there a nice and huge amusement park. Also a Nice ride.",
          "Best view of Tbilisi by far, but scratching head as to why they charge extra to get off half way up before going to the top. Amusement park at the summit, ferris wheel if you want to get even higher. A must do.",
          "take a taxi (Yandex Taxi app) and stand 1st in line so you can get front row and get a beautiful view while going up.",
          "Even in mid November the service runs regularly. Like most things in Tbilisi it is really cheap. The view at the top is great though don't expect a high quality fun fair.",
          "The vertical tram is the highlight which i was seeing first time in my life. once you reach on top it is a treat waiting for your eyes and mind. really appreciate the idea behind the whole concept. Anyone visiting Georgia should never miss this....!!",
          "Really a lot of fun goind from the amazing park down to ground zero. it's also quite inexpensive and a great way to teavel.",
          "It is something that you should try if you have time in Town. Tbilisi is a nice city to explore and I recommend it",
          "What a treat - if you can get front seats then do, although it\u2019s often busy and they do fill up the tram! The views are amazing on the way up and breathtaking at the top. It\u2019s very reasonable and the card you buy for 2 gel can then be used again and added to for the eye at the",
          "14 gel for a return ride lots to see and do when you get to the top. TV station and big ferris \ud83c\udfa1. Go up at night and see the lights of the city",
          "I wanted to go up for the view, which was worth it, but to go on the funicular you must buy a card for 2 lari (NOT the same card as the metro and cable car!!) and charge the card with 3 lari per ride. 8 lari was a bit expensive for the ride, but if you have kids it's a fabulous",
          "Great views over the city and a lovely walk down if you don\u2019t want to go up and back on the funicular. I wasn\u2019t that taken but the offerings at the top but others seemed okay",
          "You have to try the train coming and going from Funicular. Without that, your trip to Tbilisi is incomplete. It's a short 10 minutes train ride but the engineering and the overall fun involved is amazing.",
          "Very clean and reasonable place to have a Georgian bath and message. I recommend you book your own private room for your group.",
          "Good for kid, it is a very clean place the view is amazing and the prices are cheep and the food was good too.",
          "It was a short ride to the top but the view was worth it. Staff not that great in the kiosk but the drivers were fine.",
          "This must be the best value in Baku at only 1AZN for the ride to the top. Great views all over Baku and up close to the Flame Towers. Give yourself enough time to wander round as the viewing area at the top is quite extensive and you might want to go further away from the",
          "The funicular departure point is on the Metekhi Bridge the European traffic Circle. There up you can walk to the Statue of Mother Georgia, The Nariqala fortress and The Botanical Gardens. Excellent views the old town. Easy to walk down but not for people who have hip or knee",
          "We spent an pleasant Sunday walking to the Funicular. A spot of light lunch on the veranda of the restaurant. Neapolitan dessert worth the trip. Visiting the fun park behind and big wheel. Spectacular views over the city of Tbilisi.",
          "i was really looking forward to the views on this but they just let as many people as can squash into each of the 3 carriages so with a limit of 16 people each carriage ( i think) i didnt see a thing going up or down !. up the top is a park and amusement park and the trip is",
          "It was scary at first but it\u2019s all worth it . Was my first time to try funicular we enjoyed the ride and it was very safe.",
          "And full of kids. But quick and does the job once it goes! What more can you say about a train?!!!!!",
          "There is an old tramva from 19s soviet built, and it goes up to the park every 10 minutes. Very interesting tramva as it goes on a 45 degrees angle. It has an stop in the middle to a famous church.",
          "When people were telling,Funicular is a must it was hard to believe. Then you experience it, you will feel the reality",
          "This cable car will take you to Mtezida amusement park. The trouble is that you have quit a climb before you reach it. If you go with children I would suggest taking a cab to the top and the cable car as part of the attraction down.",
          ".. for kids of all ages & very reasonably priced. Visit the church halfway up. Take 0.50 gel coin for the \"loo\"!",
          "Recommended with Pantheon visiting, there are buried famous people of Georgia, church is very beautiful too.",
          "A few years ago this tram and station were completely broken down. The 19th century station is a little gem now and the ride is quick and fun! A set of stairs runs up the side of the tracks...for those with energy and lungs!",
          "On top there's and old amusement park which is quite nice. The Funicular is not that cheap so maybe taking it up and taxi down if you're in a group.",
          "Best time to end it 1-2hrs befr sunset so you can see the view in day light, and return back whn its dark so you can enjoy lights...",
          "It is a very nice view of the city from the restaurant, especially the view by night is amazing. Nice 3 course dinner with a perfect dessert. Good drink selection.",
          "you have to buy another card to travel with this fanicular cuz you cant use your city transportation card. and slon you cant give it back and take your card money too. its a tourist trick!! after you climb there and take a look around if you want to walk till the other hill",
          "Took the tram up the mountain. There are amazing views of the city and surrounding landscape. The tram drops you off in a family oriented theme park with several restaurants and booths fir drinks, ice cream etc. I hiked up the steps to higher elevation. This turned into a dirt",
          "The funicular it's very nice place to visit with friends, business meetings, family. It has great restaurant and great cafe place overlook the Tbilisi city. Also it has game attraction beautiful walking place as well. I suggest everyone to visit you not going to regret.",
          "This was a lovely way to get up the hill and unlock stunning views of the city. It was cheap and efficient. Excellent.",
          "My advice is if you have enough time, then you can come over here to try the funicular up and down, overview the whole city. But for me the view is not that much different than you see over from Narikala, it's quite same actually. But if you have limited time, you really don't",
          "Quite a nice experience, not so expensive, you can enjoy the view on the way. You should try it, at least in one direction.",
          "For us we really enjoyed this tourist attraction. The view up is great and fairly efficient. The card you buy is handy for topping up and using with the games/rides at the top. Which has a range of things to do for little kids. Our little lad who is 5 and a half had a great time",
          "Utterly rubbish experience. Other than the helpful ladies in the ticket offices the rest of the operation seems to be run entirely by halfwit teenagers amusing themselves by seeing how many people they can jam into each carriage. Waited around 15 minutes as more and more people",
          "It is a little pricey for few minutes trip, but the views on the top are beautiful. In terms of activities, there is theme park and restourant. We went for a short walk and panoramic views. Timing was great as it was still bright once we got on top and could see the panorama of",
          "I rode this funicular it was nice, the views are lovely when descending, it was a good way to get to the city after coming with a taxi. Great idea",
          "Great way to get up the hill to Mtatsminda park, but the line is very disorganized and slow. Kids were free, adults 3 lari, and you pay with credit from your Mtatsminda card which costs an extra 2 lari. Also it is up a big hill so don't think you are skipping all the uphill",
          "It realy is a nice and very short ride. Its nice to do it once on your way to the amusment park but if your are short in time I would really recommend taking a taxi straight to the park. I can be a little time consuming to get to the funicular and to stand in the line for it can",
          "It is a quick way to reach the top. The funicular dont run very often, though. But it is worth a visit to have a wonderful view over the whole Tbilisi. There is an amusement park, most for kids, and a nice and calm park to walk around in.",
          "The Funicular was great fun! The views were excellent both on the funicular and once you get to the top.",
          "Quite fun, but if we\u2019d known it would take an hour to get up we wouldn\u2019t have bothered. Fantastic views from top, couple of expensive looking restaurants and then the kids rides. We stayed about half an hour at the top, not wanting the theme park stuff.",
          "I know most countries have different standards to petting zoos for children. This unfortunately makes us a little sad. Would love to see it changed to give the animals more space and just have rabbits, etc and the larger animals especially the monkey should be somewhere else.",
          "We decided to take the funicular to the top of the hill and enjoy the view. The ride and the view were quite nice. After snapping some pictures we discovered the amusement park was slowly opening at 11am. We decided that we had explored enough and would return to the city.",
          "Just try it. It is really fun and very cheap tickets. Take a lot of photo. You can enjoy it soo much",
          "The funicular itself is nothing special, but it brings up to the spectacular view. There is a perfect view restaurant on the top with the fantastic terrace.",
          "It is a very good and effective way to go from the center to the top of the hill where the Mtatsmindas Amusement Park is situated. The price of the ticket is quite cheap.",
          "Was quite a walk to find the entrance by foot but when found just remember that it may still continue going down at night but last shuttle up ends earlier in the evening before 10pm or so. Otherwise excellent and fast way to the top (or down). Worth the view at night and nice",
          "Funicular will cost you 3 lari per person and you need a card for transportation the cost is 2 lari on the upper stop there is a very good restaurant that names funicular on the left side of the stop very tasty deserts and hachapuri",
          "If You are in Tbilisi, just go on funicular. It\u2019s passing Mtatsmindas mountain and entering in the restaurant of the big park Bombora. From where is opening the best sightseeing of Tbilisi",
          "1 person one way is 3 Gel. If you sit on the seat at the front you will see the whole view. Tbilisi view is also very pleasant to watch in the evening. There is lunapark and sightseeing area on the hill. There are also benches and restaurants to sit and watch the landscape.",
          "Enjoyed every second - Opp UP opp Down - dont miss - nice restaurant and cafe on the top and beautiful scenery of the city. Though it was a bit rainy - I enjoyed every moment -0 the price is ridiculously cheap",
          "Great experience with a great view of the city and also very very cheap. The queue was a little chaotic, but apart from that, it was a great touristy experience.",
          "Realised in 1905 like idea and now improuved , the sensation to climb is original. It's a nice place to see and to try. Up it's a big park and a higher place in town.",
          "Standing in the heat waiting for the funicular wasn\u2019t that much of fun. I wonder whether they could operate a bit more efficient.",
          "Anyone visiting Tbilisi should put aside an hour or two to travel up and down on the funicular. It is a great experience and gives you wonderful views over the city and the river. At the top there are restaurants and bars plus the park with its rides and walks.",
          "It was a nice experience going with a train up to the mountain, it was a very beautiful green park and we loved it. The train and veiw is very interesting",
          "The ride was comfortable, and the staff were courteous. We couldn't really see much of a view during the funicular ride, but the view from the top is beautiful! We didn't do much at the park at the top, just walked around a bit, but it does seem like it would be a fun place for",
          "Wonderful aerial views of Tblisi and a great amusement park for kids. Rail card required and useful for attractions at the top.",
          "The waiting and loading of rail cars could be improved but overall something you must do whenever visiting Tbilisi.Superb views day or night and fine dining to boot if that is what you want.",
          "Nothing special, but great to use to come to the mountain. It is worth it, the view, the park, live music...",
          "When we arrived the funicular was broken down. We sat in a nearby Cafe until it was up and running again. Then the queue was quite slow and the funicular itself seemed to sit at each station quite a long time. The funicular itself is modern. Given this is a review of the",
          "An interesting place to spend the day. The weather is excellent cause of it being so high up but you should expect to be thrown off due to the crowded tram that takes you up to the place. As usual the place is packed more during the evenings. If your done from Tbilisi and its",
          "Nice to see. You need to buy a card to go there and put some money in. If at the top you want to date a giant wheel just put 3 Kari per person here as well as you can use this card for payment The park on the top is very soviet but big and you can have a really nice walk",
          "Seemingly vertical ascent on this well established funicular, with modern rolling stock/ trains moving surprisingly swiftly uphill. Very worthwhile as it saves a long detour for a reasonable price.",
          "We took the funicular up to the park and back down and both ways the queue didn\u2019t have much logic as people were all over the place pushing in the line. Slow pace with the funicular drivers, all in all took loads of patience.",
          "From the city center you can go up to the park and restaurant with this \"mountain train\". Very nice experience with a beautiful view over the city when you arrive on the top. And it is also very cheap....",
          "Enjoy, it's actually the start to the amusement park trip. You go up n come down from the fennicular. Road is also there if someone wants to go by car.",
          "It would be my luck, but after going to the top, and checking out the fantastic views of the beautiful city (old and new!) below, when I was ready to go back down, they abruptly closed the cable cars due to an approaching lightning storm, requiring me to walk the 900+ steps back",
          "Experience the Funicular ride vice versa is a great experience. When your on the top, many activities can be done. It's good for family and kids will love this area. There are lots of food to eat, different resto you can choose upon. You may try to visit at night so you can see",
          "I wouldn't say it anything special. It was quite convenient as a transport mean to go down. It was quite packed with the people and we had to wit to start.",
          "It's a pain to buy tickets, you need to have a card that you then put money onto. It's a quick ride to the top and not as scary going down.",
          "seems to be a pattern i have encountered. this is one of the few places where the cards you buy are no refundable. adds to the cost for a tourist. quick way up the hill and good views from the top",
          "Ride the funicular up, see the views, check out the park (great log flume - you will get wet) and walk all the way round to the statue and Fort. Recommend!",
          "Nothing amazing about a Funicular. It is like a subway climbing a hill. There is a kids amusement park on top. Ok for a few hours, it is a bit run down. If you are from the Western world this wont amaze you. There is a decent restaurant at the top with some breeze (nice when",
          "A nice ride from the hillside overlooking Tbilisi, we took a bus up to the very old fashioned Amusement park and this down again...",
          "The funicular is a lovely way to get up the hill to enjoy the views and to get to the amusement park on the top. However be prepared for a long wait at rush hours i.e. evenings until closing time. We were lucky they asked us to go through quickly on the way up as we had a",
          "You nearly walk up a height before you even get to the finicular. Grump guides ensure you pay and a ferried to the top in a modern carnage. The area at the top is worth exploring on a sunny day.",
          "The funicular is a great chance to enjoy breathing views from the top (2nd stop). The ticket buying process is very easy and fast. But the queue to the cabin is so enormous and slow-moving. Especially when the day is hot, it's impossible to wait patiently. Inside the cabin it's",
          "Didn't know that June 1 was some special day for kids so there was a long line going up. However, well worth the wait just for the view of Tbilisi from the top. Glad I didn't buy return tickets because the line was even longer going down. Took a taxi down.",
          "You feel very safe,its is quite new and smooth.The views are brilliant.Lovely park at the top.You have a very short wait to return",
          "Very lovely funicular. Takes you to the theme park. If your not interested in the theme park it's still worth the trip for the amazing views from the top. You need to but a card for 2 gel and then you pay 3 gel to use the funicular each way",
          "I was lucky to get there early and not have to wait in line. The view at Mount Mtatsminda is wonderful. Unlike the very useful metro card which can be used on all transport this card can only be used on this funicular. Just give your card away to some other traveller so people",
          "Nice little funicular to reach an incredible view of Tbilisi. We got there about 9 am and got straight on (Saturday) but when we came down about 2 hours later the lines were starting to form. There is an amusement park at the top and some nice restaurants. You can also walk",
          "Funiculars are always nice, it\u2019s nothing you haven\u2019t seen but its still a good waste of time, if I may be so disrespectful. Definitely take a ride for a nice panoramic view and some cool vacation pics.",
          "If your taking kids then this would be fun, but if it\u2019s great views of Tblisi then this isn\u2019t so great. There are long waits going both up & down , and twe didn\u2019t think the restaurant was that great either, to busy & again long waits for food & drinks . We decided to walk",
          "We were there around 10.30 on a hot Sunday and there was no queue Really annoying that you have to pay 2 Lari for a charge card that's no use soon after. View nothing special especially as track very lined by high trees Annoying also that half way stop counts as a single",
          "The other \"go to the hilltop ride\" is great too. And different. So I did both, on the same day. And that is what you should do I think",
          "The fastest way to reach Mtatsminda park. On regular days, there is a huge line to get into the funicular. So make sure you plan ahead. I waited almost 40min in line to go up. To go down, I took it to the half point station and went down on food thought the forest. Worth it as",
          "We went up the funicular at bout 10.00 am today (Sunday). This was a quiet time with easy access, no queues at all! The price is extremely reasonable and the views are extraordinary. It is a safe and easy ride and well worth doing to get the magnificent views from the top. We",
          "Bought the card/ticket. There are several machines to enter the funicular but no signage, one line appeared to be big groups since there were only 2 of us we joined the other. Several locals were shown in ahead of us, eventually I swiped by card and went through, my other half",
          "Being in Tbilisi you will have to take funicular to go to the upper park. The card for funicular costs 2 lari and the trip costs 3 lari. We stayed in line half an hour.",
          "metro card won't work here, you will be a specific card for that. it is usually busy and crowded, it is way better and faster a cheaper way to get to the top and down.",
          "Use it if you have time and want to try one of the most popular restaurant on the top. Excellent view, especially in the evening. highly recommend to visit once.",
          "Waited in line for 90 minutes. Only takes 3 minutes to get up. Disorganised staff and locals pushed ahead of the line Not worth the wait Park at the top is worth a visit",
          "Very beautiful place from liberty square to funicular taxi will take 5 Gel only than the cable cart cost will be 6 Gel and you will find beautiful city view from height you will fee you are in the sky than a beautiful park you can stay and enjoy specially one who takes kids they",
          "I had the chance to ride this famous cable cart. There is a church in the middle and you can see all of Tbilisi at the too. Really miss this place",
          "The funicular is a modernised way to get up to the Mtatsminda amusement park on the hillside above Tbilisi. You need to get tickets from the ticket office beside the station - multiple tickets can be loaded onto a single plastic card in the same way as the city subway - it is a",
          "We took it as we have been to lazy. As we have been there on a sunny state holiday, we waited about 20 min in line as a lot of locals used the day to get out of the city. Do not think, it will be that packed on a regular day. You have to pay your tickets first (you get little",
          "We waited 40 minutes to board the funicular. Fortunately we allowed ourselves one hour to reach the restaurant for dinner at 7.30pm. On the way back, we waited 35 minutes to board with half the time queueing outside the station. The views were fantastic no doubt and the",
          "The funicular was 3min ride,expensive,with abit rusts.Had to walk a long steep uphill to reach its lower stop.The view on top was on average.The food there was on average too but its price was dear. Pass it if you dont have enough time in Tbilisi",
          "Great trip but go early as many guests will have the same idea. Stop at the top in the restaurant and enjoy view and food",
          "I have been on several funiculars over the years and the one located in Tbilisi is brilliant! It is a beautiful new funicular and it is quite pleasant to ride. There are great views from the top of the hill. Not pass up a trip on the funicular.",
          "At 15 minutes walk from the Freedom Square, for 5 GEL p.p. a short and steep tram ride will bring you (with one intermediate stop) in around 5 minutes to the top of the mountain. Great views over Tbilisi. Try the restaurant at the left side. Great Georgian pastries, pizza and",
          "It's definitely worth a trip up the funicular whilst in Tbilisi, if for nothing else than the views from the top. The park is beautiful and has something for everyone- fairground rides for the family, and various restaurants and bars. The ride up takes less than 5 minutes, and",
          "The funicular is just a way to get on the Mtatsminda park where you can see the whole Tbilisi, so I recommend to do it. Cons: large queues, too tight cabins.",
          "My son had researched this and was keen to try the park at the tops so we took a long walk up to the base station. There was a short queue, but as the park was only partially open, it wasn't long before we could take the modern funicular to the top. It was very clean and",
          "Great view from the top. We spent an afternoon there and walking around the theme park. The theme park is ok but should go to the restaurant and have a coffee or dessert!",
          "Easy access to the park overlooking the city. Great amusement park on top and good restaurants. The train is spacious and fast. It stops half way up the mountain for those who want to stop at the church. Very convenient and a fun experience.",
          "It cost 3 Lari for ride to the top. there is a big park and attractions for children. Street snack's and very lovely city view...",
          "Now this was fun! A train /funicular going up and down a mountain! Fun for the whole family. Heated seats in the cars which is a treat for winter times and a smooth magical and comfortable ride! The best of views and it goes slow enough to enable you to enjoy the wonderful",
          "A little slow while you wait to have the funicular come but a lovely view as we went up. Unfortunately we had to take a bus to go back down.",
          "Pleasant way of getting to Mtatsminda. Restaurants, bars and kids entertainment on the top, recommend going in the summer on the weekend!",
          "Visited the place with my kids. March still being cold , the ride was very nice. Even though most of the amusement park was closed due to weather. The funicular ride is interesting for kids. A good thing to do if you are with young kids.",
          "We went up using the cable car, it was midday and unfortunately all park rides were closed. The views of the city were great though, well worth it.",
          "We went up the funicular on our last day after dark. While the lights of the city were nice to see, we would have preferred to go up during the day because the amusement park at the top looked pretty fun, as far as amusement parks go. Great view.",
          "When you visit Tbilisi,leave short time for being here. Climbing the mountain to see all the places you saw. From here it\u2019s possible to see and recognize all the sights. It\u2019s cheap,and short.",
          "We enjoyed our visit. Clean, interesting and pleasantly surprised to find a fairground at the top. It was a quiet day we visited. So managed to get around the park with no queues. Ferris wheel was fun. Kids loved it. Restaurant at the top was fab.",
          "This is a fun park at the top of a cable car which you can take and look over the city. Most things were closed as it was winter but the view was great. We went for morning tea but note there are 2 restaurants and one opens at 12 and the man dining one opens at 1. We went up",
          "The whole city sparkling in front of, it is by far the most amazing view you would get of Tbilisi. If you have a choice, go during night time",
          "This was a spontaneous add on to our sight seeing trip and last day in Tbilisi. It was a cold Monday so no long lines. Incredible panoramic view of Tbilisi from behind the restaurants. Enjoyed a beautiful meal with excellent service in the restaurant! Very reasonable and a must",

          "One of a kind train to see the city on top of the mountain. Only 3 GEL to ride and you will see amazing views.",
          "Tip: get funicular to go up to the top of the hill and use stairs to go down to avoid huge ques and waiting.",
          "There are lots of things to do at the top - there is an amusement park with a big wheel (in case you wanted to go higher!) & plenty of places to eat & drink. The view of the city is amazing - we went late afternoon so managed to see the city view at night too.",
          "The park above is not so attractive but fenicular ride is a must of Tbilisi to do list. Take lowest cabin and seats for best view.",
          "It was my first time to be in a funicular. However, it was a nice experience. The funicular have two stops, you can come down in the first stop to view the old church and graves. And then go back to go further up on the mountain with the funicular where you will reach the",
          "A historic yet modernised funicular that brings you up the hill to a stunning view. Try Funicular Restaurant as well! The ride is inexpensive.",
          "The place must be fantastic during the day and during the warmer months. On a freezing January night it was empty of people. Quite a few of the attractions were open with people attending them and the image was rather sad. However, the view of the city was AMAZING.",
          "A cool experience travelling up the mountain with a stop in the middle of nowhere :-) upper station is renovated, with a great view and restaurant",
          "Visited the furnicular for the first time. People managing the place very helpful. Great view of the city from the top. At the top there is a contact zoo, games and some restaurants. You can even stop in the middle to visit the Mtatsminda Pantheon.",
          "This is a fun thing to do with kids to see the city from an interesting angle. It has a neat cable drawn system that really entertained my 5 year old. It was a great way to get to the pantheon and the park at the top of the mountain. A unique experience!",
          "We love the ambiance especially the trees all around the park. The whole gang will surely enjoy the place and the food in the funicular complex were the best especially the khachapurri and ponchik \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Cheap and great way to get up the mountain overlooking the city... the funicular is modern and quick. Wonderful views from the top where you can walk through the park or see to the snow capped mountains in the distance and across the whole of the city of Tbilisi. Another",
          "many people have written about the Funicular but I would like to mention an interesting thing I came across while waiting at the station waiting to go up the mountain. On the walls of the staion there was an exibition of pictures to celebrate the 80th year since the opening of",

          "I was not sure what to expect , a funicular, a park, a restaurant. Each of the three wagons can take 16 to 22 people , sitting and standing. The cynical goes between pine trees and climbs above the city clouds. Spectacular view , and indeed if choose to put more money on the",
          "The funicular with its modern cars runs regularly. Our aim was to have dinner in the restaurant at the top to see the city illuminated below. We were earlier than planned so strolled around the amusement park which, on a cold, grey, winter evening was rather quiet. The",
          "Worth a visit though queues can be long. The park at the top is largely closed on winter evenings which is a bit of a shame but there are great views across the city.",
          "We walked our way from Rustaveli avenue to the lower station of Funicular. It\u2019s actually not that hard as long as you have Google maps with you and a lot of energy to do walking. You need to purchase a special card for the Funicular ride. The good thing about it is that for one",
          "Super place but workers on the funicular ticketing and the funicular trip are quite aggressive and unwelcoming.The lady working at the tickets window was lashing out at the tourists who asked her normal questions and she knew English but was answering in Georgian.",
          "This is something a little bit different and is a convenient way of getting to the park at the top. The park itself isn't too exciting but the views out over Tbilisi make the trip up the top worthwhile.",
          "The trip up the hill in the tram is gives a good view of the city of Tbilisi. Up the hill you have some attractions like Giant wheel and some games. It has a good view of the Tbilisi city.",
          "Nice place to view at Tbilisi. We were in the winter and only few people was there. Some of the places was closed.",

          "Must visit place for every tourist. Wonderful view of Tiblisi, safe and efficient. This is truly the most beautiful part of Tbilisi and gives excellent panoramic views on the city. On the top there is an amusement park, great for kids and families to relax. And there are the",
          "This is a very nice experience if you want to have a stroll well above the city. It has some amusement options for children and a nice cafe where you can have lunch with a great view of the city",
          "A steep climb up the hill with a good funicular. On the top a very good restaurant. Beautiful surroundings.",
          "Worth the ride but unfortunately the day we visited it was raining. When we arrived at the top everything was closed to our disappointment.",
          "I took a ride on funicular because of good reviews but the ride on the ropeway was more exciting and cheaper. I still enjoyed the scenery on top of the mountain but I would suggest taking the bus uphill because the road was fascinating and worth taking",
          "I think this is the best place to watch a beautiful view of TBILISI .Dont forget to try AMAZING FUNICULAR .",
          "I Have travelled alone lately in the evening and drivers arrange kind of small party into a cabin, it was really fun. Cool view from the top especially in the night.",
          "Knowing the reason why it was built was actually interesting. I hope to try again soon, the view on top was amazing",
          "This is a must try activity in Georgia , its a funicular ropeway which takes you to the top for the magnificent view of the city.",
          "Very good and is a must but I you have to get a non refundable tourist card. Views from top are impressive and was better than the cable car",
          "The funicular leading up to Mtatsminda Park is a both a convenient means ot transport uphill and an architectural curiosity. It is easily accessible and inexpensive and provides a beautiful way to view and enjoy Tblissi from high above the city. It leads up to Mtatsminda park",
          "Really fab to do this ride,don't go on the weekends as the line up is massive,you can get off half way up to go and see the church on the hill side then hope back on later.",
          "Good place to walk with children, especially during hot summer days. You can try to taste restaurant or face Funicular, but it is quite hard to find place during day and evening time. Best place to watch on city if you are a guest, mostly at evening time at sundown, if snow",
          "the trip up the funicular gives great views of tbilisi, the river, bridges, churches, the presidents palace and the home of Ivanshvili, the oligarch. At the top is a nice restaurant to sit outdoors and enjoy the scenic views",
          "Nice place and view over Tbilisi, its for teenagers rather than my wife and I even though we spent long time walking and as it was like a beautiful garden over the top. There are few food cafes or canteen as well as a five stars restaurant looking at Tbilisi.",
          "A wide range of cakes and deserts. The best was Ponchiki filled with vanilla cream. Also the Idealy cake was really good. \u00c9clair was medium quality, A bit dry. The view is excellent, and a wide area for kids to play. Do not miss the cable car.",
          "If you go to Mtatsminda it is nessesary to try ponchiki - kind of cake in restoraunt on top! It is something...",
          "It is worth a ride on the funicular railway to see the view from the top and to visit the church on the way down. It is very popular with locals at weekends so would suggest midweek if possible.",
          "Your Tbilisi trip would not be complete without a visit to Mtatsminda Park which is at the top of this Funicular Railway. For 8 Gel roundtrip fee, you can go up and down by riding the funicular with fantastic views of th city.",
          "Well worth a go. It is a steep walk from the main street, though, for about 10-15 min, but then you can relax in the Cabin with a great view of the town. The view gets even better when you reach the top. You\u2019ll need a card to charge with the fee; we got ours from the Hotel, but",
          "Fairly new and fast way to climb up the mountain. To ride it, you have to buy an extra card and then you can use this card for various attractions in the fun park. Train ride is around 5-10 minutes, with a brief stop in the middle of the route. We went up there just before the",
          "Good service, although long waiting time for going up due to high load of travellers. The return way was much smoother.",
          "Took the funicular up to the restaurant and it was worth it. A very steep but safe climb up and the views were spectacular of Tbilisi and the restaurant was elegant, reasonably priced and tasty with live music taht was not too loud.",
          "A comparatively long ride with great dynamic views of Tbilisi. Well worth the money, especially if you take the front seat.",
          "The Virgin on top looked like Chrost The Redeemer in Rio from afar, but turned out much smaller and not easy to see from the top of the funicular. You cannot walk down in front and get a proper view as in Rio. The walk down was the best part, strolling through narrow streets",
          "It is a must to be done during your trip in Tbilisi. Enjoy the old railway cab, nowaday modern and confortable to clinb the Mtatsminda hill and to get in the park where you can have a rest, nice walk and if you have babies, a lot of various actrations",
          "Is it really necessary for people being paid to run a tourist operation to be rude to tourists who make a mistake? We, stupidly, thought that you had to change cars at the mid point to go to the top but ended up at the bottom again. The car operator went out of his way to try",
          "Very special view over Tbilisi \u00een The sunset. We Travel up with The tele ca \u00een and going down by foto. A very nice experience",
          "Nicely designed. No doubt that this is one of the tourist attractions and must try. Food station are everywhere and fun place",
          "The ride is interesting the view from the hill is also good.The park ideal for kids.You can enjoy the ride.",
          "Excellent views from each of the 3 carriages, but probably the best at the very front. The cars are clean and well maintained and a great way to get to the top.",
          "We came down the Funicular from the park. It was rather fun ride I must say. Coming down whilst sitting in the front row is quite an experience. We really enjoyed it. The view whilst coming down is spectacular too. It was really really fun ride and recommend people to do it",
          "Do this only if you have never done a funicular ride. The ride lasts just a few minutes and the view is mostly hidden by lush trees .",
          "This is must do in Tbilisi as Funicular itself is a very cool mechanism. Two wagons, one pulling other. But the viewpoint on the top ... mm that's the best view of Tbilisi and that's what you should try at evenings.",
          "There is alot of people on a sunday late morning, but the ride is cheap and very short. The best way to go up to see the views",
          "Great ride to the top. Pls check timing as they were closed from 4 to 6 when we visited and had to wait for an hour outside.",
          "Went twice.. first during the day (went on the big wheel in the park for even greater views 5GEL) and had nice lunch with views at the terrace restaurant. Then was told the best time is to go is evening so went again, this time eating at the Chela restaurant with vast city light",
          "You have to pay 2 Gel for a card,even if you only want to go once.And then you pay for the ticket. Think of it as a means to getting to the top and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Even when the queues are not big outside they appear to fill the cars,including people standing, before",
          "Yup the Funicular is definitely a thing to go in Tbilisi. A bit of queuing to get there but once you are in is very beautiful the way the Tbilisi open up: old building appearing next to modern ones, the river and the mountains that surround the city itself. Definitely you start",
          "The staff is rude and untrained. There are queues, and half of the passengers ride standing. Good view only from the bottom two places when you looking down the mountain. Costs gel 3 per card and gel 2 per ticket. I recommend to go to the Park by bus, which costs 0.5 gel.",
          "They have amazing restaurant on the top... lovely local food. Also, good place to spend time with kids. Very fresh air on the top...",
          "Take the funicular to reach the Mtatsminda Park. At peak times you may need to stand in the car. Views are good.",
          "We wen there by tram. There are two choices. By taxi or tram. Tram is more traditional and very chip. Even you go there by walk , it is not far from down town. Funicular is an old restaurant. Now it is included 4 restaurants. We pick Georgia cuisine. We reserve it from hotel to",
          "Funicular is very good place to relax and have dun. There you can find attractions, cafes, restaurants, bars and etc. Funicular must be seen if you are tourist. I would recommend to sit on the Eye, bexause it has spectacular view.",
          "The funicular is a great way to get from Tbilisi town to the entertainment park on top. However we walked from the fortress to the entertainment park (about 3km, 1,5hours) and to get down, the waiting line was long and if you want to get out to visit the pantheon you have to pay",
          "It is like a park if you go up.. But the journey in the sloppy train is really amazing. The evening time is good as it won't be much hot.Kids can enjoy lot.",
          "It's a fun way to spend the day. We took a taxi to Mtatsminda Park which offers beautiful views and many things to do. Then we took the funicular down. We had to stay standing because it was overloaded with people. Going down just takes a minute.",
          "In my opinion, this place is a must visit if u r in Tbilisi, specially if u r with kids or teenagers. The view from the top is spectacular. There are so many rides that u can enjoy with the kids. The place at the top is very beautiful and worth visiting.",
          "The Funicular is very clean and provides lovely views of Tbilisi. The Funicular requires a card - it costs 2.5 Gel, that you load up with credit in advance and then use for the Funicular and also for the amusements at the top - they do not accept cash on these rides. Note:",
          "It takes very short time and money, so everyone should do it. You get nice views from \"above\" (I went with dark and was really nice) and you can go beside \"mother Georgia\" statue.",
          "Nice to go to the top and check, not that exciting, can skip if you have very little time and had visited other european countries in this type of train.",
          "I wouldn't want to walk to the top. The is a fully refurbished modern funicular that whips you to the top of the mountain and a clean well maintained carriage. Great views of the city.",
          "To get up it is 2GEL for a card and 2GEL per passenger per direction, so up down is 4GEL. Babies ride free. People are most likely to give up their seats to mommies carrying babies. The amusement rides do not take cash, so you will need to charge your card to enjoy them. Also",
          "The ride in the Funicular brings you to the theme park the ride itself however allready is worth the trip",
          "Great location on Mtatsminda mountain the highest place in Tbilisi where is the Tv tower is located. It has a playing park for both adults and children. Up there many restaurants and cafes are available.",
          "If you really like funicular railways then take this ride if not it's pretty pointless. At the top there are some second rate amusements and stands selling a poor selection of food and drink. When we went up the restaurant sign said closed. It was something to do for an hour but",
          "Nice and cheap way to get a view of the city. On the top there is an old amusement park and some restaurants:)",
          "Lovely view the oversee all of Tbilisi. It is worth a visit especial if you have a little walk and meal at the top.",
          "Nice attraction, especially if you\u2019re with children. The view from above is just super. Highly recommended.",
          "The funicalor is a fast and pretty cheap wat to get up the hill to have An amazing view over the city. At night the view is even better with all the lights of the city. On top of the hill there are also two restaurants a normal one and a more high class restaurant. One way price",
          "This is a great way to reach the top of the hill and the restaurant and attractions that are there. A lot faster than the driving alternative",
          "The place was visible from my apartment in Tbilisi so i googled and went there. The 2 way ride was very cheap- about 5 lari. It has a park for kids, a restaurant and few other things at the top. After a long queue, I went up through the tram. The tram stops at one level and",
          "Reasonable kids play park up top but not many suitable for 4-6 year olds. Lots for very young and slightly older, however. Big queues to come back down and no play activities open until 12pm so don\u2019t head up too early.",
          "If you ever visit Tbilisi, this place is must see. You take a very nice tram ride to the Mountain Mtatsminda and the view of the city from the tram is astonishing",
          "Is really worth it! Is very cheap... like 5Gel double way. Try to get in the first compartment so you will enjoy the view better. Sometimes it can take a bit to get into the funicular since they don\u2019t go too fast but still you will enjoy the trip and is the easiest way to get to",
          "The Funicular is a must! it is not too expensive and the view of Tbilisi is amazing. We Recommend the restaurant at the Top with a very nice day-trip around the park",
          "Really nice view especially in the evening. Kids will certainly appreciate to play there. It works till late",
          "Not only that the cost is cheap its the scenery and the vibe that the place has. Reaching the top opens your eyes of how amazing the city is.",
          "This is the fastest and least-expensive way to get a great view of Tbilisi. It\u2019s possible to walk to the lower station from the old city (20-25 minutes). Lunch on the veranda at the restaurant at the top was very good, also with a spectacular view.",
          "The Funicular is a quick and scenic way to reach the Mtatsminda Park. 100% recommended for families hoping to get to the funfair and the viewpoints. A card must be bought for 2 GEL and one person goes for 3 GEL. The card is also the funfair card, which you can recharge.",
          "We took the taxi from station square and paid 25 Lari. On the road was an amazing trip. You literally see the whole Tbilisi from top. By the entrance there was no fee. We did not expect that it was an amusement park. The park opens at 11 am. Funicular opens at 12 noon. Food they",
          "This century old funicular offers access to the amusement park above. The history is interesting and the new trains are comfortable despite the lack of A/C",
          "The ride was enjoyable but overcrowded. There was not any ordered queue and you can't always see outside.",
          "A very entertaining place for kids. A nice experience overall. It has a beautiful view of the surrounding places.",
          "We went up just before sunset, the lines were starting to get a bit long but we didn't wait more than 15 minutes. Price is ok. Views from the top were great, enjoy some wine by the ferris wheel while watching the sunset. Great place to visit if you have kids!",
          "funicular is a good attraction :) this is what it was and will be like many years ago. Funicular will take you to the beautiful park \ud83c\udf32",

          "A good way to reach the theme park up there. U could spend the day upthere with ur kids or date. Nice ride through the mountain. Great view at top.",
          "I did not imagine they would actually hold a global summit there. So I went, not for tourism but for business. I was positively impressed.",
          "At the top of the funicular, there\u2019s a naff little theme park with mini-zoo, bumper cars, Ferris wheel, cafes, and at least one bar that offered \u201cUnlimited Wine for 10 GEL\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s $4! One of the best spots atop the plateau, however, was at the eponymous Funicular restaurant",
          "Absolutely nice way to get up! Buying of tickets was easy, no waiting time! Service was nice and polite. Especially coming down on night was offering great views on Tbilisi.",
          "We spend an evening on the terrasse dining with a view over the city. The waiters are very helpful and the food is the best we've had while being in Georgia",
          "You pretty much have to take the Funicular just for the view alone. Plus you can get a respite of that nasty inner city air with a bit a refreshing oxygen. If you have kids, there's a fun little amusement park amongst the pines. The Funicular restaurant is ok - overpriced and",
          "Great ride. See if you can get a seat facing down as you ride. Going up especially the view just opens up as you go up the mountain. View from the top is excellent",
          "Going up with the funicular is certainly something worth doing. There is a huge park up there with a lot of fun things to do and beautiful sights. Make sure to eat in the Funicular restaurant in the entrance",
          "They take 3 lari for each station to person(there is 3 stations) and additional 2 lari God now why for the card. When I asked why should I pay for the card, everyone told they don't know \ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd28 funny but infuriating. \ud83d\ude0f They over the city is nice but not worth it.",
          "You are paying for the view, but the food and cocktails are of a good standard. Great spot to watch the sunset over Tbilisi.",
          "Most tourist leave city Tbilisi, without visiting this place, i think it must visit place entrance fee is quite cheap like a Dollar , my suggestion is to go to mtastminda by bus or some other transport and come down by funicular",
          "We took the Funicular and had dinner in the restaurant on the top. Beautiful view and the trip took a few minutes only. There was just one problem with the restaurant. My dish arrived before my husband\u2019s so i had finished my dish when he got his. Strange They didn\u2019t figure out",
          "It is a kind of tram that takes you up the mountain where there is Ann amusement park. The park is average but doing this gives you a break from the usual touristy stuff. The view from the top is amazing. Good photo op. The park rides are pretty cheap. Must have at least 2 hours",

          "It\u2019s a must to do when you are in Tbilisi. Very comfortable modern cars that bring you in couple of minutes up the hill. On the way up the views are simply stunning. The funicular has an intermediate stop where you can disembark to visit an old monastery. We didn\u2019t do it,",
          "To get the best views sit in the front coach while going up or down, else you cant really see much. Its a very short ride but quite steep. The interval between rides is 10 - 15 minutes.",

          "Unexpectedly surprised by how nice the whole area is with the amusement park, the restaurants and walking around was great!",
          "Went up the funicular trainway in the early evening. Excellent views across Tbilisi and it\u2019s surrounds as the sunsets. Had dinner at the Chela Bistro, really good menu and excellent local beers. Nice park to walk around too",
          "We walked up to the funicular through the steep streets near to the entrance. It\u2019s quite a trek in the heat. The pricing was confusing. You need a card which you seem to have no choice but to purchase and then the money is loaded on to it to get through the turn style. Once up",
          "More or less like any other funicular that you may have visited - not worth traveling on as a special trip",
          "I loved this, climbing the mountain with a thing like a train that just climbs the path for you. You can also watch the views or sit for yourself. It was fun, be sure to take the two way ticket, you can also buy one card for two person, and don\u2019t need to pay for two cards. The",
          "Great means of transport to get from the base of the mountain- Old Tbilisi, Sololaki district, to the very top- Mtatsminda Park. The is one more stop in the middle.",
          "The funicular railway is a good way to get views over Tbilisi as the top station is around 770m above sea level. At the top there is the funicular restaurant complex, but also Mtatsminda Park, which is a mix of bars, amusement park and restaurants. From memory it was 3 GEL",
          "When you buy your return ticket what they don\u2019t tell you is that it seems to come with credit, to go on some rides in Mtatsinda Park. At each ride i had to show this card and receive a discount. When we wanted to descend, the unfriendly guy told me i had used all my credit up.",
          "Sunday afternoon and with the sun appearing, our tour guide suggested we take a one way trip on The Funicular up to the top where we had magnificent panoramic views over Tbilisi and surrounds. A really cheap fare of GEL 3/- per person - the Funicular operates 7 days a week",
          "During few minutes journey you can se panorama of Tbilisi. At the top is restaurant in which you can by something to eat or drink. But the best is view from the top.",
          "You will pay 8 gel round trip. It is the best option to arrive at the restaurant complex! Comfortable and fast!",
          "through the tram you can get a good look of the city.the ticket is bit expensive, the park is just ok ,best for kids & u can enjoy the giant wheel & see a gr8 sunset view from the top.",
          "Was there before Tue noon and we were one of very few people (maybe 50 altogether). After we went down with around 3 km walk to Mother of Georgia (don\u2019t buy return ticket and turn right from funicular entry on the top) where you can experience full serenity - there were no",
          "I went up and it was just okay. I did not eat at the restaurant. Sure, the view is good, but there are other, better views of the city. I didn\u2019t go to the amusement park. If I had kids, maybe that would\u2019ve been great.",
          "This is a very convenient and easy way to Mtatsminda Park. Works until late evening though opens late in the morning. You can have a beautiful view from the mountain top as you get there!",
          "At first I was scared because of heights. But when you go at the top of the funicular, you will see a very nice view and will be inside a restaurant.",
          "Cute little ride in the train to the park (3GEL one way). The park at the top has restaurants and bars with traditional food at very good prices - definitely worth a visit. The park should introduce a refund scheme for the cards (2GEL) instead of forcing you to buy something",
          "Nice experience if it's your first time on a fanicular .Great fun for kids on the top with different rides to choose from .View of the city from the top,but not many viewing decks.The resturant at the top seemed popular as many tables were reserved.",
          "We went up in the funicular one evening and watched the sun set over the city. Nice! Good modern facility. Excellent vantage point at the top for photos of the old and new city.",
          "Very nice experience. It's clean and fast and the view is speachless. From the top you can see all Tbilisi.",
          "Funicular is a must I Tblisi . I can only recommend. Spend the afternoon on top of the town. The view from the restaurant is stunning and gives you a good idea of the city structure. (The cakes are also really good)",
          "Of course you can visit this place! The best view of Tbilisi only over there! Park so much relax and good restaurant upstair",
          "For a few lari you can ride to the top and get the best views of Tbilisi. There\u2019s a fun park at the top, but also bars, restaurants etc. It was well worth it and we enjoyed the experience.",
          "Starts with nice ride, amazing view, finger licking food.. what else you look for when you are on leisure.. This place is worth the visit..",
          "Quick way to get from Mtasminda park to the down town. Instructions how to pay are on the photo. It's convenient way to use it. And you can also make photos when going.",
          "The Funicular ride is an experience and reaching the Mtatsminda Park was a journey. The soviet era restaurant is a water-down experience and so is the intimidating TV TOWER. The views of the city and the stepped park are worth looking at.",
          "I mean.. whats to say. Its a tram that goes up hill? If you haven't ever ridden on one of these and you're here sure why not however they do appear to be in most former soviet countries and if we are to compare apples with apples, the Kiev funicular is a little more visually",
          "Lovely outing on a nice day to take the funicular up the hill to Mount Mtatsminda from where you can see the whole of Tbilisi. The view really is fantastic and the ride up very enjoyable, quick and cheap. The park up there is mostly an amusement park for children but still great",
          "Historical station, with very modern and safety train. Not expansive and easyest way to get of Funicular or on Pantheon. Very special place for children and for people who love beautiful views over old city. Enjoy)))",
          "A must see whilst in Tbilisi, the views from the top are fab, the restaurant is great also but take a jacket as it can get cold even on bright sunny days!",
          "This was a wonderful dining and aesthetic experience. The views from the top of the mountain are breathtaking. Once at the restaurant, you must go out on the balcony to have the full experience.",
          "This place is a must visit n has got awesome view of Tbilisi n the park on the top is just mind blowing.",
          "Feels safe and modern, leaves on time. Brings you up to Mtatsminda with amusement park, fancier restaurants and famtastic view Best way to get there.",
          "The funicular is a great way to reach Mtasminda Park. The station is located quite far up the hill and therefore quite hard to reach, I would recommend taking a taxi. It is cheaply priced and you can use your orange transport card, if you don't have one you can get one of",
          "This is one of the unique rides you can have in a lifetime. The tram travels on a steep slope taking you from Old Tbilisi to Matsminda park.",
          "The station is at a walking distance from old town and Freedom square area. Fairly short ride with nice views. Can get crowded during holidays.",
          "If you haven't been on a funicular, then this will certainly interest you. For the best experience, make sure you're in the first or last carriage. Otherwise you'll miss the real reason for taking the trip and making the uphill effort (if you don't cab there) - which of course",
          "The funicular runs uphill to Matsminda Mountain and back with splendid views of the city as you get to the top. Make sure you get the front seat next to the driver to enjoy your ride or else the experience is like travelling in just another tram. Since there is a ride every 15 \u2013",
          "It's nice to go up the hill, to walk there and have a nice view being above the city but the Ferris Wheel is reconstructed now and it's the main reason to use the funicular to get up there.",
          "Terrible and very very expansive place ! Me and my husband came to Tbilisi to celebrate his birthday ! Hotel concierge told us to come here and it was our worst decision ! At first I would like to mention that interior was very unpleasant, then the menu is very poor and very",
          "The staff were so helpful and the food was only surpassed by the fabulous views of Tbilisi by night, well done the staff of the restaurant for making our Georgia experience memorable for the right things.",
          "This is the shortest way to reach Mtatsminda Amusement park located at the top of hill. This train is very comfortable, however views are not that great when we traveled as it was cloudy and hazy. Front seat before the driver gives much better views. It is great to know that",
          "From there is the best view on the city. It's better to go there at evening and take a look at the night Tbilisi. There are 3 restaurants up there, so you can order food or drink and enjoy your evening.",
          "If I knew what it was I would have not taken this ride and wasted the little money that I did... it is like a tram which goes up and then brings you down ...nothing much to do up there it could be an excitment for the kids",
          "This was a quite nice trip to the hill. There was an interesting restaurant up there with a marvelous view.",
          "The funicular in itself looks very good, modern design, lot os history pictures put around in the building, but other than that, it is just a tramway. The park at the top is more for families & people with adventurous theme park wishes.",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a walk to get up to the funicular from liberty square but it is definitely worth it! For about 12 lari we went up to the top (and back down) for a look at the view and we were not disappointed. You can see the whole of Tiblisi from the top and get good pictures of",
          "We loved the whole drive to this place and it\u2019s a must do when it comes to \u201cthings to do\u201d in Tbilisi Georgia. The drive is about 25 mins from Rustaveli Avenue and offers a gorgeous view of the whole city from the top. Food is good. Typical local Georgian food like Khinkhali and",
          "Well worth a trip on the funicula for the spectacular views from the top. There is a restaurant and various activities including a small theme park enjoyable afternoon",
          "Good experience travelling on this tram uphill to matsminda park. Leaves every 15-20 mins. Small in size with limited seats. Short trip lasting 5 mins one way. Good views of the city. Even roof top is transparent. Some cafes at the station available for a coffee and ice-creams",
          "Very friendly staff . Welcoming and warm atmosphere. The wine list is very good collection of wine. Our table was for 5 people. There is astonish view from the mountain to the city. The ingredients are fresh and each dish we order was excellent.",
          "Nice place! Service us ok but not very good, late and people who came after us got food the same what we ordered earlier! The waitress did not remember what was ordered. Food is regular!",
          "This is one of the best funiculars I\u2019ve been on takes you to the restaurant and park complex again it\u2019s very inexpensive 2.5 lari each way per person 75p approx or just under a doller!!",
          "its an experience not to be missed and some real good views of the city, especially at night. nothing much to do in the park on top though! its a short walk from the Freedom Square,along the back alleys of Tbilisi, if you take the right route.. keep your GPS handy, as people may",
          "The fun part is the vertical train ride which was unique and interesting!! You can travel up to the garden cum themepark called mtatsminda park. You have to buy the tickets for both the train and park!!",
          "I will advise everyone there is lot of walk if you are going from the park side. there is starting point even at the ground level, so those who cannot walk tell the driver not to take you from the park side as it is a problem for those people who cant walk much, otherwise it is",

          "This place is a must-see because it offers a wonderful view to Tbilisi. I think it will be a better experience if you go there in the evening. There is one big restaurant where, beside khinkali, you must try a dessert called \"ponchiki\". Super tasty.",
          "You should by a ticket that costs 5 Gel for around trip per person, the Funicular was built more than 100 years ago, up there you will have a chance to take advantage of playgrounds and it is somehow fun.",
          "There are various attractions at the top of the hill but many were closed on the morning of our visit.This was not important because we had used the funicular to take advantage of the views from the top. Well worth the visit amd some attractive gardens to walk through as well.",

          "Ofcourse he ride is exciting and you will have panoramic view of Tbilisi. BUT the best part is in the middle ofcthe road. There is a stop and from there you can visit Mama Daviti Church. One of the most beautiful churches we visited in this city.",

          "Funicular is located beside Mtatsminda Park on top of the mountain, so the view is definitely awe inspiring, especially at night when the bustle of the city is reduced to a soft murmur. We ate pastries at the one of the restaurants. The prices are very low compared to what we",
          "A unique experience going up the hill in this ride. Safe and throwing splendid views of the city's major attractions as you ascend to the top. Very affordable rates and a good thing is multiple people can travel with one card so need to buy multiple cards which would be of no",

          "The amusement park was a lot of fun. It was pay as you go, like a carnival. The lift was clean and safe. The trees need trimming for a better view, and the line was long to go downhill. Nice ride though.",

          "We took the funicular up the park on a rainy evening and we didn't see much. In my opinion, it isn't spectacular at night. I suggest tourists should go to the mountaintop park during the day and see the city in it glorious sight. The cost is only 2.5 Gel. It's pretty close to",

          "The beginning station was very good. Its old rail train was excellent. during going up you can see all Tbilisi. But I suggest to visit there sunset times and nights. Train works to 4 a.m. But the restaurant has just good view. no very good course or stuff. It was so crowded too.",

          "Since there are very few choices in Tbilisi in terms of attractions, Funicular gets into ones itinerary by default!! For the experience of riding on the inclined rail ( 45 degree gradient, that really is very steep for both climbing up or coming down). The Carriage itself is",
          "View was good after a long taxi ride. Because it's a open to public there isnlot of loose when dining on the balcony. Service is just horrible. Many waiters don't speak English. You can go up in the tram for GEL 5",

          "Funicular is a very important restaurant for georgians. It was one of the biggest highligts in the dark Sovjet Life, In my opinion it still is. The Amazing thing with Funicular is that it has its sections. On the first floor u can have a delicious budget meal and if you want",
          "We just went up the funicular not knowing that it leads up To the amusement park. Remember to take the front row seats for best view!",
          "It is nice small attraction you cam easily merge with other sights. The only disgusting is you cannot use cash or Metrocard. For the trip you have to buy a special magnetic card and put some amount of money and comparing to city transportation it is not cheap.",

          "Don't miss going up on the funicular for the view you get of the city from the top. Dont miss walking around the park on the top. We went on a weekend and were able to enjoy watching a group of students dancing and inviting everyone to dance to modern Georgian music in the",
          "This is the example of great funicular, you can't expect much from it - it has nice view, I'm not sure about air conditioning so it could be really hot on sunny days, be careful. On the upper stop there's decent restaurant. And of course views - they are amazing, whole Tbilisi",

          "The ride is steep but very slow. Has two station - one takes you to Mtatminda Pantheon & second one to the Mtstsminda park. The tickets are available at the ground station, costs 15 GEL(if i am remember it right). The ride is just 15 minutes to the top station. there are two",
          "A good means of transport to the Mtatsminda Park. The ride uphill and downhill is scenic but is slow, As I said, Not a ride for thrill seekers! At the top, there is a good amusement park which has good rides, I recommend the \"Ghost House\" and the \" American Rides\".",

          "Worth Every Penny, a fantastic location to see Tiblisi. The Funicular it self is a pleasant experience, but once you reach the top it just takes your breath away. Lovely cafe on the top worth a Coffee and Cake. Standing beneath the TV Tower is impressive. You've got to go",

        "wiki": "Svaneti or Svanetia (Suania in ancient sources; Georgian: \u10e1\u10d5\u10d0\u10dc\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8 Svaneti) is a historic province of Georgia, in the northwestern part of the country. It is inhabited by the Svans, an ethnic subgroup of Georgians.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSituated on the southern slopes of the central Caucasus Mountains and surrounded by 3,000\u20135,000 meter peaks, Svaneti is the highest inhabited area in the Caucasus. Four of the 10 highest peaks of the Caucasus are located in the region. The highest mountain in Georgia, Mount Shkhara at 5,201 meters (17,059 feet), is located in the province. Prominent peaks include Tetnuldi (4,974 m / 16,319 ft), Shota Rustaveli (4,960 m / 16,273 ft), Mount Ushba (4,710 m / 15,453 ft), Ailama (4,525 m / 14,842 ft), as well as Lalveri, Latsga and others.\nSvaneti has two parts corresponding to two inhabited valleys:\n\n Upper Svaneti (Zemo Svaneti) on the upper Inguri River; administratively part of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti; main town Mestia\nLower Svaneti (Kvemo Svaneti) on the upper Tskhenistsqali River; administratively part of Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti; main town LentekhiThey are separated by the Svaneti Range which is almost as high as the main Caucasus range. Historical Svaneti also included the Kodori Gorge in the adjoining rebel province of Abkhazia, and part of the adjacent river valleys of Kuban and Baksan north of the crest of the Caucasus. Writing in 1848, Bodenstedt said that Upper Svaneti could only be reached by a difficult footpath which was closed in winter.\n\n\n=== Landscape ===\n\nThe landscape of Svaneti is dominated by mountains that are separated by deep gorges. Most of the region which lies below 1,800 meters (5,904 ft) above sea level is covered by mixed and coniferous forests. The forest zone is made up of tree species such as spruce, fir, beech, oak, and hornbeam. Other species that are less common but may still be found in some areas include chestnut, birch, maple, pine and box. The zone which extends from 1,800 meters to roughly about 3,000 meters (5,904\u20139,840 ft) above sea level consists of alpine meadows and grasslands. Eternal snows and glaciers take over in areas that are over 3,000 meters above sea level. The region is notable for its glaciers and picturesque summits.  Svaneti's signature peak is probably Mount Ushba which towers over the Inguri Gorge and can be seen from many parts of the region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate of Svaneti is humid and is influenced by the air masses coming in from the Black Sea throughout the year.  Average temperatures and precipitation vary considerably with elevation. Annual precipitation ranges between 1000 and 3200 mm (39 and 126 inches). The highest amount of precipitation falls on the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The region is characterized by very heavy snowfall in the winter and avalanches are a frequent occurrence. Snow cover may reach 5 meters (16.4 feet) in some areas. In general, the lowest regions of Svaneti (800\u20131200 meters / 2624\u20133936 feet above sea level) are characterized by long, warm summers and relatively cold and snowy winters. Middle altitudes (1200\u20131800 meters above sea level) experience relatively warm summers and cold winters. Areas above 2000 meters above sea level lie within a zone that experiences short, cool summers (less than 3 months) and long and cold winters. Large parts of Svaneti lie above 3000 meters (9840 feet) above sea level, a zone which does not have a real summer. Due to Svaneti's close proximity to the Black Sea, the region is spared from the extremely cold winter temperatures that are characteristic of high mountains.\n\n\n== History ==\n \n\nThe Svans are usually identified with the Soanes mentioned by Greek geographer Strabo, who placed them more or less in the area still occupied by the modern-day Svans. The province had been a dependency of Colchis, and of its successor kingdom of Lazica (Egrisi) until AD 552, when the Svans took advantage of the Lazic War, repudiated this connection and went over to the Persians. The Byzantines wanted the region, for if they secured its passes, they could prevent Persian raids on the border areas of Lazica. With the end of the war (562), Svanetia again became part of Lazica. Then, the province joined the Kingdom of Abkhazia (John and Adarnase of the Shavliani dynasty, 871\u2013893) to form a unified monarchy which was incorporated into the Kingdom of Georgia in the early 11th century. Svanetia became a duchy (saeristavo) within it, governed by a duke (eristavi). The province\u2019s Orthodox culture flourished particularly during the Georgian \u201cgolden age\u201d under Queen Tamar (r. 1184-1213), who was respected almost as goddess by the Svanetians. The legend has it that the duchy was annually visited by Tamar. The Svans had been known as fierce warriors for centuries. Their inflatable war banner was named Lemi (Lion) because of its shape.\nThe marauding Mongols never reached Svanetia and, for a time, the region became a cultural safe house. Following the final disintegration of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 1460s, fighting broke out for controlling the province. Part of Upper Svanetia formed an independent principality under the Princes Dadeshkeliani, a branch of the Gelovani family, while Lower Svanetia, originally ruled by the Princes Gelovani, was temporarily usurped and subdued by the Mingrelian princes Dadiani. Facing serious internal conflict, Prince Tsioq\u2019 Dadeshkeliani of Svanetia signed a treaty of protectorate with the Russian Empire on November 26, 1833. Difficult to access, the region retained significant autonomy until 1857, when Russia took advantage of the dynastic feud in Svanetia and effectively abolished the principality\u2019s autonomy. In 1875, the Russians toughened their rule by imposing additional taxes. Protests ensued, and Russia deployed troops against the province. Despite having suffered heavy losses, the Russian army units eventually crushed the rebels burning their stronghold Khalde to the ground in 1876.\nPart of the Russian governorate of Kutais, Svanetia was divided into two raions (districts) \u2014 Mestia (former Sethi) and Lentekhi \u2014 under the Soviet rule. The unsuccessful anti-Soviet Svaneti uprising took place in the region in 1921. \n\nIn 1987, avalanches destroyed several homes and killed at least 80, many of them school children. In the aftermath the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed a decree to resettle some 2,500 families to districts of eastern Georgia (eco-migration to Marneuli, Tetritskaro, Bolnisi, Sagarejo, Gardabani, Dmanisi, Kaspi, Tskaltubo, Khoni, Ozurgeti, and Lanchkhuti rayons). The end of the Soviet Union and subsequent Georgian Civil War created severe socioeconomic problems in the region. While the Svanetian population resisted the unpleasant conditions of the high mountain environment they lived in for centuries, the increasing economic difficulties of the last two decades and frequent natural disasters \u2014 floods and landslides as of April 2005 ([1]) have brought about a strong tendency towards migration. The province became a safe haven for criminals threatening local residents and tourists. Large-scale anti-criminal operations carried out by the Georgian Special Forces as of March 2004  resulted in significant improvement of the situation.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\nThe Svans, the indigenous population of Svanetia, are ethnic subgroup of the Georgians. Until the 1930s, Mingrelians and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader category of Georgian thereafter. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and were Christianized in the 4th-6th centuries. However, some remnants of old paganism have been maintained. Saint George (known as Jg\u00ebr\u00e6g to the locals), a patron saint of Georgia, is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained many of their old traditions, including blood revenge. Their families are small, and the husband is the head of his family. The Svan really respect the older women in families.Typically bilingual, they use both Georgian and their own, unwritten Svan language, which together with the Georgian, Mingrelian, and Laz languages constitute the South Caucasian or Kartvelian language family.\n\n\n== Culture and tourism ==\nSvanetia is known for its architectural treasures and picturesque landscapes. The botany of Svanetia is legendary among travelers. The famous Svanetian tower houses, erected mainly in the 9th-12th centuries, make the region\u2019s villages more attractive. In the province are dozens of Georgian Orthodox churches and various fortified buildings. Architectural monuments of Upper Svanetia are included in a list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nSvan songs and dances are notable cultural traditions. Svanetia boasts arguably the most archaic three-part polyphonic singing. Most of their songs are connected to round dances, are performed very loudly and are full of dissonant chords.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSamegrelo-Zemo Svaneti\nRacha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti\nKodori Valley\nDadeshkeliani\nUshguli\nGelovani\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Svaneti travel guide from Wikivoyage\nFrescos and icons from Svanetia.

        "wiki": "Kutaisi (, Georgian: \u10e5\u10e3\u10d7\u10d0\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 [k\u02b0ut\u02b0\u0251isi]) is one of the most ancient cities in the world and the third-most populous city in Georgia, traditionally, second in importance, after the capital city of Tbilisi. Situated 221 kilometres (137 miles) west of Tbilisi, on the Rioni River, it is the capital of the western region of Imereti.\nHistorically one of the major cities of Georgia, it served as political center of Colchis in the Middle Ages as capital of the Kingdom of Abkhazia and Kingdom of Georgia and later as the capital of the Kingdom of Imereti. From October 2012 to December 2018, Kutaisi briefly was the seat of the Parliament of Georgia as an effort to decentralise the Georgian government.\n\n\n== History ==\nArchaeological evidence indicates that the city functioned as the capital of the Colchis in the sixth to fifth centuries BC. It is believed that, in Argonautica, a Greek epic poem about Jason and the Argonauts and their journey to Colchis, author Apollonius Rhodius considered Kutaisi their final destination as well as the residence of King Ae\u00ebtes.\nLater, it was capital of the kingdom of Lazica until being occupied briefly by the Arabs. An Arab incursion into western Georgia was repelled by Abkhazians jointly with Lazic and Iberian allies in 736, towards c.786, Leon II won his full independence from Byzantine and transferred his capital to Kutaisi, thus unifying Lazica and Abasgia via a dynastic union. The latter led the unification of the Georgian monarchy in the 11th century.\nFrom 1008 to 1122, Kutaisi served as capital of the united Kingdom of Georgia, and from the 15th century until 1810, it was the capital of the Imeretian Kingdom. In 1508, the city was conquered by Selim I, who was the son of Bayezid II, the sultan of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nDuring the 17th century, Imeretian kings made many appeals to Russian Empire to help them in their struggle for independence from the Ottomans. All these appeals were ignored as Russia did not want to spoil relations with Turkey. Only in the reign of Catherine the Great, in 1768, were troops of general Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben sent to join the forces of King Heraclius II of Georgia, who hoped to reconquer the Ottoman-held southern Georgian lands, with Russian help. Totleben helped King Solomon I of Imereti to recover his capital, Kutaisi, on August 6, 1770.\n\nFinally, the Russian-Turkish wars ended in 1810 with the annexation of the Imeretian Kingdom by the Russian Empire. The city was the capital of the Kutais Governorate, which included much of west Georgia. In March 1879, the city was the site of a blood libel trial that attracted attention all over Russia; the ten accused Jews were acquitted.Kutaisi was a major industrial center before Georgia's independence on 9 April 1991. Independence was followed by the economic collapse of the country, and, as a result, many inhabitants of Kutaisi have had to work abroad. Small-scale trade prevails among the rest of the population.\nIn 2011 Mikheil Saakashvili, the president of Georgia, signed a constitutional amendment relocating the parliament to Kutaisi. On 26 May 2012, Saakashvili inaugurated the new Parliament building in Kutaisi. This was done in an effort to decentralise power and shift some political control closer to Abkhazia, although it has been criticised as marginalising the legislature, and also for the demolition of a Soviet War Memorial formerly at the new building's location.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKutaisi is located along both banks of the Rioni River. The city lies at an elevation of 125\u2013300 metres (410\u2013984 feet) above sea level. To the east and northeast, Kutaisi is bounded by the Northern Imereti Foothills, to the north by the Samgurali Range, and to the west and the south by the Colchis Plain.\n\n\n=== Landscape ===\nKutaisi is surrounded by deciduous forests to the northeast and the northwest. The low-lying outskirts of the city have a largely agricultural landscape. The city centre has many gardens and its streets are lined with high, leafy trees. In the springtime, when the snow starts to melt in the nearby mountains, the storming Rioni River in the middle of the city is heard far beyond its banks.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nKutaisi has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with a well-defined on-shore/monsoonal flow (characteristic of the Colchis Plain) during the autumn and winter months.

January is the coldest month with an average temperature of 5.4 degrees Celsius while August is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24.7 degrees Celsius. The absolute minimum recorded temperature is \u221217.0 \u00b0C and the absolute maximum is 43.1 \u00b0C\nAverage annual precipitation is around 1,500 mm (59.06 in). Rain may fall in every season of the year. The city often experiences heavy, wet snowfall (snowfall of 30 cm/12 inches or more per single snowstorm is not uncommon) in the winter, but the snow cover usually does not last for more than a week. Kutaisi experiences powerful easterly winds in the summer which descend from the nearby mountains.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== Culture ==\nKutaisi has an ancient cultural tradition.

        "wiki": "Turtle Lake is a direct English translation of Kus Tba (Georgian: \u10d9\u10e3\u10e1 \u10e2\u10d1\u10d0), a small lake at the outskirts of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, so named due to the perceived abundance of turtles living in these places. The other, less frequently used name of this lake is K'ork'i (\u10e5\u10dd\u10e0\u10e5\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e2\u10d1\u10d0).\n\n\n== Overview ==\nTurtle Lake is located on the wooded northern slope of Mtatsminda Mount at elevation of 686.7 m above sea level and fed by a small river Varazis-Khevi, a tributary to the Mtkvari (Kura). The area of surface is 0.034 km\u00b2, while the catchment area is 0.4 km\u00b2. Maximal depth is 2.6 m.\nThe Turtle Lake area is designed as a recreational zone and is frequented by the Tbilisians on weekends. It is also a place where festivals and concerts are held. It can be reached either via a road or an aerial tramway leading from Tbilisi's Vake Municipality - this began operating once more in October 2016, is open from 8:00 until 22:00 and costs 1 lari in each direction. West to the lake is the Open Air Museum of Ethnography, a large exhibition of Georgia's folk architecture.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLisi Lake\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Turtle Lake at Wikimedia Commons",

Although the term \"Old Tbilisi\" has long been used to denote a historical part of the city, it was only in 2007 that it became a distinct administrative entity to incorporate several historical neighbourhoods formerly included in the districts of Mtatsminda-Krtsanisi, Isani-Samgori, and Didube-Chughureti. The district was abolished in 2013, with its territories allotted to several other divisions of the capital.\nOld Tbilisi is principally centered on what is commonly referred to as the Tbilisi Historic District, which, due to its significant architectural and urban value, as well as the threat to its survival, was previously listed on the World Monuments Watch (1998, 2000, 2002).The district is located on both sides of the Kura River and is dominated by Mount Mtatsminda, Narikala fortress and the Kartlis Deda monument. It chiefly represents a 19th-century urban fabric with largely eclectic architecture which includes the buildings and structures from the 5th to the 20th century. However, most of the pre-19th century city did not survive due to the devastating Persian invasion of 1795. Only survived building is La Residence, Castle in Old Town the only privately owned Castle in Georgia. Once a fortress before the Mongol invasions, it was from the 16th century the residence of the Persian Shah Administrator for eastern Georgia. The district houses a bulk of the tourist attractions in Tbilisi, including churches, museums, sulphur bathhouses, and peculiar wooden houses with open, carved balconies. In the 19th century, the core territory of the modern-day district of Old Tbilisi was tentatively subdivided into ethnic neighborhoods such as Avlabari with its Armenian and Georgian quarters, Alexanderdorf German quarter on the left bank of the Kura River and the Persian Quarter (Said-Abad) on the right bank of the Kura River.\nOld Tbilisi has been the centre of a thriving art community with artist Giovanni Vepkhavadze known for specializing in painting many street scenes in the district.\n\n\n== New Life of Old Tbilisi ==\nIn 2010, the government of Tbilisi started a program initiated by Mayor Gigi Ugulava. The idea was to renew old and damaged houses and cobbled streets to make Old Tbilisi more attractive for tourists and visitors.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nPickard, Robert (ed., 2001), Management of Historic Centres, pp. 93\u2013112, 275\u2013286.

With many miracles ascribed to him, Gabriel's grave at Mtskheta has attracted an increasing number of pilgrims. The Georgian Orthodox Church officially canonized him as Holy Father St. Gabriel, Confessor and Fool for Christ (\u10ec\u10db. \u10e6\u10d8\u10e0\u10e1\u10d8 \u10db\u10d0\u10db\u10d0 \u10d2\u10d0\u10d1\u10e0\u10d8\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10e6\u10db\u10e1\u10d0\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8-\u10e1\u10d0\u10da\u10dd\u10e1\u10d8), on 20 December 2012.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGabriel was born as Goderdzi Urgebadze in Tbilisi in the family of a Communist Party functionary, who was murdered in 1931. After a compulsory service in the Soviet army, he decided to join the monastic life and was tonsured a monk under the name of Gabriel in 1955. He made himself famous by setting fire to a banner depicting Vladimir Lenin during an International Workers' Day parade in downtown Tbilisi in 1965. He was arrested, tried, ruled to be psychotic, and confined to a mental hospital for seven months. An account of this incident was also published in the West, in the Orthodox zine Death to the World in 1994.Gabriel spent much of his later life at the convent of Saint Nino, a nunnery attached to Samtavro Monastery in Mtskheta, an ancient town north of Tbilisi. He died there in 1995 and was buried at the Samtavro churchyard.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\n\nThe monk Gabriel is believed by the Orthodox followers to have possessed powers of healing and prophecy, while his remains are considered to be incorrupt. The oil from a lamp which constantly burned at his tomb in Mtskheta was also considered to have been miraculous. The grave became an increasingly popular site of pilgrimage. In 2012, the Georgian Orthodox Church officially recognized him as a saint. In January 2014, rumors that Gabriel made the promise in a vision to a local nun in Mtskheta that two wishes would supposedly be granted to those who arrived at the tomb just before Orthodox Christmas on 7 January sparked mass pilgrimage to the saint's tomb so as extra police units had to be deployed to control traffic. The church officials and the nun eventually dismissed the rumors as false.The relics of Gabriel were exhumed for reburial into a special crypt within the Samtavro monastery in February 2014. Prior to the reburial, his body was rested at four major Orthodox cathedrals in Georgia, attracting thousands of pilgrims from all over the country.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMshvenieradze, Dali (2006\u20132007). \u10d1\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d3\u10d8\u10d0\u10d3\u10d4\u10db\u10d0. \u10db\u10dd\u10d2\u10dd\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10db\u10d0\u10db\u10d0 \u10d2\u10d0\u10d1\u10e0\u10d8\u10d4\u10da\u10d6\u10d4 [The Monk's Diadem.

        "wiki": "Lisi lake (Georgian: \u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e2\u10d1\u10d0) is a small lake in the vicinity of Tbilisi, Georgia; belongs to the Kura River valley, home to a large mixed-use development project by the same name. The landscape is rocky and arid with shrub vegetation and plots of steppe. The lake and surrounding area provide a habitat for variety of different species of exotic birds. In addition to various avian species, the area around the lake provides shelter to a variety of animals such as turtles, foxes and hares. The area is well known for the large population of snakes that live in the hillsides around the lake.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThere is a warm, Mediterranean, and reasonably dry climate in Lisi Lake. The annual precipitation is roughly 400 mm (< 20 mm in January, < 40 mm in April, < 40 mm in July, < 30 mm in October), and there are 20 to 30 days with heavy rains per year. There are also 10 to 20 days with snow cover. The mean temperatures are: January /0, April/12, July /23, October /13, and the mean maximum temperature (in July) is 37 degrees celsius.\n\n\n== Controversy regarding redevelopment ==\n\nPlans are in place for Green Lisi Town, a mixed-use development on the lakefront. Chairman of TBC Bank, Mamuka Khazaradze's Georgian Redevelopment Company is behind the project, while architectural firm Andropogon did the master plan and site design.\nPhase One of Green Lisi Town opened in 2011.Current plans for the redevelopment of the area date to 2007, when a group led by Mamuka Khazaradze outbid a group of Israeli investors by offering 182 million USD for 354 hectares of land. Conditions of the deal with the government required Khazaradze's group to spend 30 million USD on public utilities upgrades in the area and on a system to provide badly needed fresh water to the lake. Khazaradze's group balked at the conditions of the deal and ended up, under questionable circumstances, purchasing the land directly from the city for 55 million USD - a savings of 127 million USD from the original bidding against the Israeli group. All requirements to improve the ecology of the local area have been dropped, and the only conditions now in place regarding development in this area is the requirement for yet more for-profit housing.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTurtle Lake, Tbilisi\n\n\n== External links ==\nLisi Lake to Regain Past Glory, by Nino Patsuria.

        "wiki": "Islam in Georgia (Georgian language: \u10d8\u10e1\u10da\u10d0\u10db\u10d8 \u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e8\u10d8) was introduced in 654 when an army sent by the Third Caliph of Islam, Uthman, conquered Eastern Georgia and established Muslim rule in Tbilisi.  Currently, Muslims constitute approximately 9.9% of the Georgian population. According to other sources, Muslims constitute 10-11% of Georgia's population.In July 2011, Parliament of Georgia passed new law allowing religious minority groups with \u201chistoric ties to Georgia\u201d to register. The draft of the law specifically mentions Islam and four other religious communities.Mosques in Georgia operate under the supervision of the Georgian Muslim Department, established in May 2011. Until then the affairs of Georgia's Muslims had been governed from abroad by the Baku-based Caucasus Muslims Department.In 2010, Turkey and Georgia signed an agreement by which Turkey will provide funding and expertise to rehabilitate three mosques and to rebuild a fourth one in \nGeorgia. While Georgia will rehabilitate four Georgian monasteries in Turkey. The Georgia-Turkey agreement will allow the reconstruction of the historical Azize mosque in Batumi, Ajaria demolished in the middle of the last century. Turkey will rehabilitate the mosques at Samtskhe-Javakheti and Akhaltsikhe regions, Kobuleti District, build the Azize mosque burned down in 1940 and restore the Turkish bathhouse in Batumi.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Emirate of Tbilisi ===\n\nThe Arabs first appeared in Georgia in 645. It was not, however, until 735, when they succeeded in establishing their firm control over a large portion of the country. In that year, Marwan II took hold of Tbilisi and much of the neighbouring lands and installed there an Arab emir, who was to be confirmed by the Caliph of Baghdad or, occasionally, by the ostikan of Arm\u012bniya.\nDuring the Arab period, Tbilisi (al-Tefelis) grew into a center of trade between the Islamic world and northern Europe. Beyond that, it functioned as a key Arab outpost and a buffer province facing the Byzantine and Khazar dominions. Over time, Tbilisi became largely Muslim.\n\n\n=== Timurids ===\n\nBetween 1386 and 1404, Georgia was subjected to invasions by the armies of Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur, whose vast empire stretched, at its greatest extent, from Central Asia into Anatolia. In the first of at least seven invasions, Timur sacked Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, and captured the king Bagrat V in 1386. In late 1401, Timur invaded the Caucasus once again. The King of Georgia had to sue for peace, and sent his brother with the contributions. Timur was preparing for a major confrontation with the Ottoman dynasty and apparently wished to freeze the currently prevailing situation in Georgia, until he could return to deal with it more decisively and thoroughly at his leisure. Thus, he made peace with George on condition that the king of Georgia supply him with troops.\n\n\n=== Ottoman Empire and Iranian Period ===\n\nThe Safavid dynasty was in constant conflict with the Ottomans over full control and influence in the Caucasus. From the early 16th to the course of the second half of the 18th century, the Safavids had to deal with several independent kingdoms and principalities, as Georgia was not a single state at the time. These entities often followed divergent political courses. Safavid interests were largely directed at Eastern (the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) and Southern (the kingdoms of Samtskhe-Saatabago) Georgia while Western Georgia came under Ottoman influence. These independent kingdoms became vassals of Persia as early as in 1503.\n\nOn May 29, 1555, the Safavids and the Ottoman Empire concluded a treaty at Amasya following the Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1532\u201355) by which the Caucasus was divided between the two. Western Georgia and the western part of southern Georgia fell to The Ottomans, while Eastern Georgia (comprising the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) and the (largest) eastern part of southern Georgia fell to Safavid Iran. The bulk of Georgia and the region which had historically always been the most dominant stayed therefore in the Iranian sphere. This partition of the Caucasus and therefore including Georgia under Islamic rule was again confirmed in 1639.\nIn 1703, Vakhtang VI became the ruler of the kingdom of Kartli. In 1716, he adopted Islam and the Safavid ruler confirmed him as King of Kartli. However, at a decisive moment Vakhtang was ordered to discontinue military campaigns, leading Vakhtang to adopt a pro-Russian orientation, though the Russian failed to tender him the promised military aid.\nFor several centuries, the Georgian kings and aristocrats converted to Islam and served as courtiers to the Iranian Safavid, Afsharid and Qajar dynasties, who ruled them.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe Muslims constitute from 9.9% (463,062) to 10-11% of Georgia's population.\nThere are two major Muslim groups in Georgia. The ethnic Georgian Muslims are Sunni Hanafi and are concentrated in the Autonomous Republic of Adjara of Georgia bordering Turkey. The ethnic Azerbaijani Muslims are predominantly Shia Ithna Ashariyah and are concentrated along the border with Azerbaijan and Armenia. The Chechens of Georgia living in Pankisi Gorge are also of Muslims of the Naqshbandi order.\nThe Meskhetian Turks, also a Sunni Hanafi group, are the former inhabitants of the Meskheti region of Georgia, along the border with Turkey. They were deported to Central Asia during November 15\u201325, 1944 by Joseph Stalin and settled within Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan.  Of the 120,000 forcibly deported in cattle-trucks a total of 10,000 perished. Today they are dispersed over a number of other countries of the former Soviet Union. There are 500,000 to 700,000 Meskhetian Turks in exile in Azerbaijan and Central Asia.There are also smaller numbers of Muslims in Georgia belonging to other ethnic groups of the South Caucasus, such as Ossetians, Armenians, and Pontic Greeks (divided between Caucasus Greeks and Turkish speaking Urums). These are mainly descended from Ottoman-era Christian Orthodox converts to Turkish Islam. Many of Georgia's Muslims defined as 'Ottoman' following Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign that led to the Ottoman conquest of Georgia in the 1570s were actually of Armenian or Pontic Greek origin whose ancestors in Eastern Anatolia had adopted Turkish Islam. One prominent example of an Ottoman Muslim from Georgia of Caucasus Greek origin was Resid Mehmed Pasha, who ironically played an important role in suppressing the 1822-33 Greek War of Independence  (see also Greek Muslims and Armenian Muslims).\n\n\n=== Geographical distribution ===\nAccording to the 2014 Georgian Census, there were 398,677 Muslims in  Georgia, down from 433,784 Muslims according to the 2004 Georgian Census. However, the share of Muslims clearly increased from 9.9 percent in 2004 to 10.7 percent in 2014. The Muslim population lives mainly in rural areas (298,668 people, or about 75% of the total population). \n\n\n== Notable Georgian Muslims ==\nAghsartan I of Kakheti - a king of Kakheti in eastern Georgia from 1054 until his death in 1084.\nAllahverdi Khan - Iranian Safavid general and statesman of Georgian origin who was Christian and converted to Islam.\nGeorge XI of Kartli - a Georgian King who ruled the Kingdom of Kartli and later he became viceroy of Kandahar province.\nKaikhosro of Kartli - a wali of Kartli for the Safavids. He was the nephew of Gurgin Khan.\nMemed Abashidze\nDavid XI of Kartli - a Safavid appointed king of Kartli\nJesse of Kakheti - an Iranian Safavid appointed ruler of Kakheti who converted to Islam.\nKoca Yusuf Pasha - Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire who also served as the governor of Peloponnese.\nSimon II of Kartli - an Iranian Safavid appointed king of Kartli\nYirmisekiz Mehmed \u00c7elebi - Georgian Ottoman statesman\nOmar al-Shishani - Georgian-born ISIS commander\nJemal Tabidze - Georgian football player\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nChveneburi\nIranian Georgians\nBatumi Mosque\n\n\n== External links ==\nIslam and Islamic Practices in Georgia\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Jumah Mosque is prominently perched on a hilltop. Distinctly Persian in architecture - we only saw the exterior and did not visit inside. This was our first stop in the Old City yesterday after finishing with Mtskheta as part of our Private Tour. The main purpose of this stop",

          "I do not know about the old occupation of this place, but we were told that this is in fact king Shah Abbas's personal soulfor bath that he had taken politic sessions in there. The architecture is Islamic due to the effect of Islam on the Iranian architecture in those days. For",

          "Sadly, the mosque was under construction when I visited, but even the view of the exterior was magnificent. The architecture is similar to mosques in Iran and the blue tiles are stunning. This mosque is a gem amongst other historical buildings in the old city.",

          "Itself - nothing special, but the area around - Abanotubani - just super! In general, a very unusual and picturesque location and a rivulet flowing near the sulfur baths and a number and if a bit of a mosque to go directly to the city of Falls.",
          "This masjid is a very nice classic place. While i visited in 1st week of Dec 2016 it was under some construction work due to which it was covered in front by a big curtain. I missed to enter and offer my prayer as i was with infant and ipt was extrmely cold evening. I wish",

          "The mosque is pretty and there are some tea houses nearby but that's about it. That whole block feels kind of Turkish so if you're looking for an authentic Georgian experience, this corner would probably not be part of my itinerary.",
          "We went there in search of sulphur baths, At that time we could see from outside. Some construction works were going on at that time . Hence I am unable to give visit experience . From outside it was good. Blue colored stones and nicely built.",
          "It's so owsem to have that mosque in Tbilisi. Even though, majority are Christians , finding that gathering especially in Friday made me so proud of Islam peace religion spreading everywhere even quietly. People are in harmony you cannot diffenciate. Mosque has a very nice",
          "Jumah mosque is the only surviving mosque in Tbilisi and, although small, it's very beautiful. It's an active mosque, so visitors must show appropriate respect. Everybody is welcome (even non-muslims), as long as they comply by the rules and don't Forget it is a place of worship.",
          "This mosque had a very pleasant inside. It is particularly light and airy with light coloured walls which makes it less dark than many other mosque I'd been to. Nicely decorated outside.",

          "The place is too small to accommodate the volume of worshipers so better go early around 1 p.m itself to get place inside the mosque. It has wudoo facilities and toilets, not sure about women worshipers have space to pray or not. Can see a lot of different nationalities.",
          "When we were there in March there was scaffolding around the entire Mosque. But the vibrant colors were visible and will probably be even more spectacular when completed.",

          "We walked in with a group and weren't given a second glance. This mosque is different than others I've been in, men and women are welcome to visit together (women need scarves) and even talk at a whisper. We tried not to be disruptive to some worshipers there, and there were",

          "We weren't able to go inside, but it was nice to see such a prominent Muslim place of worship so comfortably set in the centre of old Tbilisi, across the river from a church and in the shadow of Narikala castle. It was also right next to the Sulphur baths and on the way to the",

          "It is located in the old, historical part of the city, the architecture is really beautiful. It would be really great if they had more information inside the mosque both for Muslim visitors in terms of prayer timing, the dates of the holidays and the Eid prayer times and also",

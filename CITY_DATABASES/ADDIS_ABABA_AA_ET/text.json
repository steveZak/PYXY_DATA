          "the best place to see the the pre-history and ethnography of the country, even if the museum is distinctly dated - so worth seeing. Other things to see there also, but not everythings merits close attention - depending on your interests of course. So you need a less than two",
          "Spent a very pleasant couple of hours in the museum, as part of a tour with Ethiopian Discovery Tours. Started with a trip to a superb espresso bar (the oldest in Addis Ababa?) before the museum. The museum was large, with well presented exhibits and explanations, for both the",
          "This museum could be so much better. I also think it's disingenuous that they're not honest about the \"Lucy\" skeleton (FYI, it's fake). A lot of people come to see that but no one will tell you the real one is not accessible to the public. It's a shame, this museum could be",
          "The exhibits include archaeological discoveries such as the fossilized remains of early hominid, artwork from the past to the present, various historical artifacts, and items from the various cultural groups of Ethiopia.",
          "The museum was under renovation when we were there. We could only visit the ground floor of the museum but not the second floor. The lighting was not enough in the museum, which made the whole place a bit gloomy. Not enough explanatory information is available for the exhibits.",
          "An interesting museum to learn about natural history, history, ethnography and modern art of Ethiopia, all under one roof. Famous Lucy ( or its replica) is in the basement, together with some other fossils of early humanoids, and fossils of some of the extinct animals. I found",
          "it is a museum full of Ethiopian history and natural resources . it has three parts divided by floor. you need to pay an entrance at the reception.",
          "The highlight of the museum is the exhibit of Lucy in the basement. Which draws most visiter to this place. It has great details of the human kind origins and transformation along with other exhibits on the ground and 2nd floor",
          "I had been to the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa few couple of hundred times for work purposes since 2005. It was always strange puzzle for me why they don't make any (yes ANY) changes - even the 10 Birr Entrance fee for foreign vistors is still the same after more",
          "Don't miss the ground floor of this museum to see the history behind homo sapiens' development and the other varieties that came before us. It's well laid out and well explained, so all ages will enjoy and learn.",
          "Here the highlights for us was in the basement to see palaeontological exhibition Lucy and the noble peace prize winner (2019 ) PM Abiy Ahmed's medal by the entrance. The rest of it is poorly labbled and displayed. In the compound, one that caught my eyes were the statue of",
          "Amazing museum and artefacts! Seeing Lucy and Salem was fascinating. Very cheap, ~\u00a31 equivalent for 3 adults entrance. Good signs and information in English too. A must if in Addis Ababa. Need atleast an hour.",
          "an inexpensive museum, not quite up to what we expect in the west... the basement exhibits especially the story of lucy is the best part",
          "This is a very low tech and dated museum but still tells the history of Ethiopia pretty well. The famous Lucy skeleton is still on display as are many other rare and important finds in the world of palaeontology. Small entrance fee and you are searched at the gate to the site.",
          "Seeing the remains of Lucy, the first biped skeleton brought tears to my eyes. So beautiful displayed in a museum so intimate and humbling",
          "Tick one off my bucket list! I've seen Lucy! The 3.2 million year old remains of one of our oldest ancestors. Ok, it's probably a replica of the bones, but seeing it here in Ethiopia was a dream come true. There are many more fossils and remains on the basement floor level",
          "Leave plenty of time to tour this important museum. Most people will go to the basement to see the excellent exhibits and signage on human and hominid history and evolution along, of course, with Lucy, Ardis, and Salem. However, there are some interesting artifacts on the entry",
          "The pre-historic exhibits in the basement are well-explained. To see and learn about the discoveries of \"Lucy\" and then, more recently, of \"Selam\", the child, are not to be missed. Spend all the time that is available to you DOWNSTAIRS, and only if you have a moment or two",

          "The Ethiopian National Museum is very worth a visit. The best part of the museum is on the bottom floor, where they have their paleontological displays. The highlight here is Lucy, the famous 3.2 million year old skeleton of a human ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis, that",
          "The museum is a showcase for the evolution of various species, most notably man. Of course \"Lucy\" was the highlight. We had an excellent guide who explained the various geological eras and how both man and animals changed over time. Without a guide, there is a lot of reading",
          "The museum houses national treasures and several early humanoid discoveries such as the world famous Lucy - a highlight of this museum and not to be missed!",
          "No trip to Addis Ababa can be complete without a stop at the National Museum if for no other reason than to see the world-famous Lucy! This is a small museum and really doesn't require much more than an hour to fully see everything. It does house a small but impressive",
          "Lucy is on the lower level. Anti-climatic for me. The last century of rulers are celebrated on the main floor. The second floor was the best for me as local, regional art work was on display.",
          "This is not the Museum of Natural History in New York: it is a small museum, and the main attraction is not just the copy of the remains of Lucy (3+ million year old Australopithicus), but the entiore display on extinct humanoids and animals. It is important to remember that",
          "The museum is a bit run down, but the exhibits are good and of course the skeletal remains of Lucy are pretty spectacular. Oldest human remains ever found (location in Harar-East Ethiopia Outside of the Museum are two large, and old, live Tortoises...",

          "At only 10birr admission (approx 20 pence) this is a must visit place when in Addis. Laid out over 4 floors - each with a different theme - it provides a good couple of hours of fascinating material. You do NOT need a guide to enjoy as most exhibits have explanations in English.",
          "The museum houses some fantastic historical and educational material. It is quite well laid out over several floors. The site itself is in need of some tlc and the toilets need to be upgraded to cater for the number of visitors.",

          "This is a great start to your visit in Ethiopia. This museum has a great collection of exhibits including Lucy, political and historical facts, information on th different regions of Ethiopia, modern paintings etc.",
          "This IMO is the best place to visit in Addis Ababa. It gives you a great history of the region and origins of humanity. The Lucy skeleton on display is a replica, however when I visited they had just put the 2019 Nobel peace prize on display also.",
          "You get a quick idea about the history of Ethiopia if you don\u2019t have enough time to visit the northern part of Ethiopia.",
          "Besides Lucy, the oldest known bones of humans, there is nothing else to see here. Good for a few minutes of ones day",
          "I was surprised to see the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize on Display here. Plus you see the actual bedroom & bathroom of Haile Selassie. This place is huge, don\u2019t let the outside fool you. Definitely add this to your agenda.",
          "Ethiopia the cradle of civilization and amazing historical landmark encircled with over 80 tribes and tradition,i literally have no words to explain the richness of the culture,the love I have for Ethiopia reigns supreme and I encourage anyone to come and find the true Ethiopia.",
          "The national museum house of Lucy, a three and a half million year old fossilized skeleton attracts the interest of most visitors. The museum is non renovated. Other interesting exhibits are the \u201cwakas\u201d a wooden statues of Konso highlands.",
          "Spent a couple of hours walking through the museum. It is very interesting with several exhibits throughout the 4 floors. The highlight of the whole museum are the skeletal remains of Lucy, a 3.2 million year old woman.",
          "This was a very interesting place to visit. The kids loved it and wanted to see 'Lucy' which was the main attraction for me here. 'Lucy' is believe to the first skeleton of human remains ever found. The museum is a great place to see and learn a lot about the human evolution. It",
          "Interesting museum covering Ethiopian history since Dinkenesh (a.k.a. Lucy) up to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed recently awarded Peace Nobel Prize medal.",
          "A must see for anyone visiting Ethiopia. You get a sense of the culture and people of not only Ethiopia but African history",
          "National museum is quite small but the bottom floor has some interesting information about evolution. Also modern Ethiopian art is available. Easy to access with local minivans. Entrance is 10 birr per person so totally worth visiting!",
          "A good place to understand important archaeology discoveries. Many good stuff to see apart from Lucy.",
          "Obviously Lucy is a must see in Addis. The museum is quite small really. There is not a lot of traffic inside the museum so you get right in. The cost was minimal. There are a few other items to look at in the museum but not what I would expect from the National Museum.",
          "Worth a visit, very old skeletons and some history about the country. Not so good for old people as there are stairs and 4 floors. Informative and reasonably priced",
          "Entrance fee only 10 birr. Small museum, but a must see, because of the scelet of Lucy, a woman at the basis of human history, named after the beatle's song Lucy in the sky. On the first floor you can see some art works of Ethiopian artists, interesting if you like art. Second",
          "This museum contains a wealth of information about the history of man and Ethiopia and also contains beautiful works of art by local artists. It is definitely worth an hour and a half to two hours in order to absorb the details. Start with the basement, where the evolutionary",
          "I was pretty disappointed with the museum. The display building up to Lucy and the whole bottom floor is pretty interesting and well done, the other three floors are basically empty with very little information. For a country with so much history I was expecting much more. Also,",
          "I visited the museum twice in a week. I loved going downstairs as it covers the history of Ethiopia going back millions of years, with excellent relics.",
          "We were on a tour of Ethiopia starting in Addis Ababa. This included a visit to the National Museum which was interesting, but not overwhelming. There is some good artwork but most of the exhibits, some in a poor state of preservation, could do with a makeover. However, this is",
          "An unforgettable experience! The displays are interesting and unique adding to overall memories of Ethiopia. Never been to a museum quite like it.",
          "National Museum of Ethiopia has a lot to offer. It got world class exhibits, sadly, due to lack of funding and proper management, the museum is in a sad state. But if you are interested in human history and Ethiopian culture (I assume most of people visiting Ethiopia are), you",
          "The first human discovery,filled with contributing rich history of ethiopia,the cradle of civilization and it's history of survival as a nation of independent.with over 80 tribes pieced together as one.also our own calendar which is now 2012. There is more to adventure as you",
          "Only the basement has an interesting display. There are several amazing fossils. The top attraction is \"Lucy\" , but only a copy of her remains are displayed. The other floors where of limited interest.",
          "Nice museum in town. Ground floor, one underground and 2 floors above. A great map of Ethiopia near the entrance. Crown chair of Emperor Haile Selassie and his wife, agricultural instruments, musical instruments, old utensils and clothes from different parts of Ethiopia. Lucy or",
          "My fianc\u00e9e and I went to the museum to see Lucy. We got there and enjoyed the down stairs section a lot. We saw many descriptions of the displayed items, very vividly advertised. As I was watching a video on a TV screen about how they remove the dirt and other stuff from a skull",
          "We ended up not spending a lot of time here. The basement area is the most interesting with some real fossils but unfortunately a replicate version of \u2018Lucy\u2019. The descriptions are not so well written and the basement is a bit damp. On the first and second floor are some crowns,",
          "I do not know much about what else is in the museum - we spent ALL of our time in the anthropology exhibit, which was by far the best and most instructive we have ever seen. We went to see the \u201creal\u201d Lucy, only to learn that the museum display is a replica, which was a",
          "Could do with a good clean up and maintenance but we saw Lucy Lots of interesting history and information about fossil and the rulers",
          "You have to see Lucy, and then you have to see all the surrounding exhibits to really start to understand the big picture.",
          "If you are interested in the history of mankind you have to visit this museum, it is the home of Lucy who lived 3.2 million years ago in Ethiopia. It is not like any other national museum, the decor is shabby but when you take a guided tour, it is a nice place to spend an hour",
          "We went there only to visit the paleontology department. You should visit Luci our ancestor 3.2 Mio years old).",
          "I\u2019m torn on this review.. on one hand, I had a very good and informative visit, but that was due entirely to visiting with a guide. The museum itself is very drab and has extremely limited signage/explanatory information on the exhibits. Worth a visit with a guide.",
          "I came mostly to see 'Lucy \" but unfortunately there was a very large group of tourists surrounding the display case and were reluctant to move away. Like all museums in Ethiopia it requires a lot of money and maintenance to display the exhibits to their best.",
          "Educational and memorable. Better with the guide. Don\u2019t miss Lucy - first discovered human. Visit authentic restaurant beside. But be aware that most of food is very spicy. Try to avoid the bathroom.",
          "It\u2019s an amazing experience to see our ancestors from 3m years ago. The lower floor is brilliant but we found d the other floors less interesting.",
          "Best Place to visit for people who pretrioize historical places . It have every info about history of ethiopia .I viisted during my 2 days stay in addis",
          "Very cheap 10 Birr admission fee. You could spend an hour or so nothing more but if you want to say you've done something cultural worth a visit.",
          "Yes you must visit to see \u2018Lucy\u2019 and other hominid ancestors- that floor is fairly well done but like most of the museums in Ethiopia it lacks funds, looks sad and run down to be housing such incredible exhibits. We skipped the other floors as there are only so many crowns,",
          "The museum shows many artifacts, tools, armaments used by the various tribes in Ethiopia. It is only nominally well displayed with most descriptions in English.",
          "I was looking forward to visiting the Museum and seeing Lucy. I am always very interested in the history of countries I visit, I was disappointed to find all exhibits are in a poor state and the grounds outside are very poorly kept, It was still very interesting and worth the",
          "They are smaller then I imagined. A guided tour would be preferred as he can explain more in detailed.",
          "This museium should not be missed as it ranks as one of the most important Sub-Sahara Africa. Contains the skeleton of Selam. Found ini 2000 at Dikika, in Northern Etiopia. Selam is an Australopithecus-aphaeresis.",
          "Smaller than imagined but very interesting and worth the visit especially to see the oldest human skeleton of Lucy. Definite must visit in ADDIS..",
          "make sure to see lucy there. ask tour guide at door about her. museum is 3 floors full of antikes. all national dresses are shown plus history of kings and ancient stuff inside. 2 birr for locals and 10 bir for forigners.nice day tour for history",
          "We only went on the first two floors. The bottom one had alot of ancient tools and skeletons including Lucy the oldest one found so far. The next floor was about the Emperors and included Haile Selassies throne. It was only a minimal charge to get in.",
          "Nothing to shout about when it comes to amenities or even the physical quality of displays. However, the content is worth the visit. Don\u2019t expect great museum service. Must do things on your own. Entrance fee on Ethiopian Birr 10 only per person.",
          "This is highly recommended for those who are planning to go to Addis. Being in this place seems like you are travelling to the past. A lot of interesting facts about the discovery of the skeleton of the homonoids and the human evolution theory itself is so interesting.",
          "Go to see Lucy, stay to read all the great information plaques on evolution and see bones even older than Lucy's. The basement has some fantastic bilingual plaques and the set up is very professional. The ground floor contains some pre-Axumite artefacts, some of which are",
          "It is very nice place to be I sow one of hostraropitec person whose name luccie it was amaizing,it was in Addis ,hhhhhhhjjjjjjhhh+bhhhhhhhhh",
          "The museum is nothing spectacular but its got a good amount of Ethiopian history which is interesting.",
          "Some interesting exhibits. Most interesting is the reconstruction of \"Lucy\". Whole building feels super rundown, but the entry fee was super cheap. Can't have it both ways I guess.",
          "The museum is located in very pleasant green grounds, and houses quite a range in its collection - from pre-historic to the contemporary. Well-worth getting a guide. Allow at least 2 hours for a thorough look. Apart from the famed \"lucy\" skeleton, there are others as well",
          "My friend & I took a day tour of Addis Ababa. Our guide took us here for a visit. Obviously, Lucy is the draw. Apparently her bones are too fragile to be displayed so there are very good facsimiles. There are also art exhibits and Haile Selassie's throne. There are 3 floors and",
          "National museum of Ethiopia is only 4 km from Bole airport. Blue white taxi will cost between 100-150 birr, with local transport only 3 birr one way",
          "Ethiopia has so much history and this museum does not do it justice. Old fashioned and dull. Lucy is the star attraction but her story was not told well.",
          "Definitely worth seeing. Quite shabby but definitely go. We went to all the floors with a guide. I would suggest you get a knowledgeable guide to explain things the writen explanations do not cover.",
          "This was a good, small museum that we could get through fairly quickly and clear quite a bit. I would say that it was worth the time!",
          "the museum was excellent, we had a couple of hours there and we see so many thing in side the museum.",
          "This museum is well worth a visit. If you love history and culture, you will spend three or four delightful hours drinking in the uniqueness of a most special country: Ethiopia!",
          "A shame that this museum was not up to standard - it had world class exhibits but much needed to be done about displaying them and providing explanations. Love the replicas of Lucy & Selem. Saw some extremely interesting videos but there was no sound or written advice about what",
          "This museum surprised me. The building certainly has seen better days, but the exhibits and information conveyed are excellent. The Lucy exhibit is the most famous and is indeed quite good, but I didn\u2019t know what to expect about the other parts of the museum. As it turns out,",
          "The history is most interesting and the museum is well preserved. Allow some time so you can truly enjoy the experience. Best with a guide who can sure more on what you see... otherwise its just stuff",
          "Went here to see Lucy and learn history of Ethiopia. In that regard, it did a good job and they have a major draw. However, not as nice as other museums we've seen but a good place to visit nonetheless",
          "The main attraction of Addis Ababa National Museum are the interesting remainings of prehistoric inhabitants found in Ethiopia. There are other items worth to explore but the quality of the site has many opportunities for improvement.",
          "Great museum with lots of artifacts. Only 10 birr entrance (about $0.33 USD). Excellent value for your money. Lucy, Selam, and Ardi can all be seen here. Upper floors have Ethiopian art and traditional tools.",
          "3.2 million year old Lucy is incredible. You see the bones, a replica, and a lifesize model of what she would of looked like. For less than a buck you can't ask for more. The evolution of horses and information on the evolution of humans was mind blowing. Also see the gigantic",
          "Was happy that I got the chance to visit Addis Ababa on a layover for South Africa. Visited the National Museum and the church. Nothing wrong with the museum but apart from the novelty of seeing Lucy nothing spectacular. Was more impressed with the huge church that I visited",
          "We had city tour with our local tour guide in the national museum including the first origin Lucy. We had great time with the city tour",
          "If you are in Addis Ababa, They have done an excellent job of presentation and design that is both interesting and informative from an anthropological perspective. Unfortunately, the place could use a little touch up. With just a coat of paint and some new carpets this place",
          "I mostly went there to visit Lucy, just was interested to see this experienced lady, because she is enough old to tell us about prehistory. i did not like our guide because the first thing he talked about was money, he could tell us the price in a more polite way. any way, i",
          "So this small and unpretentious museum is in my opinion awesome - proto-humans, your 3.3 million+ year old great-great-...great grand parents are lying there in simple display that is so inspiring and jaw dropping. I reckon while the number of exhibits is few they are unique (",
          "It\u2019s a must if you are in Addis! The price is only 10 birr and there are the rest of Lucy. You can see quick and very well explained!",
          "Although a bit run down in appearance on the inside and out, the National Museum contains some amazing pre-Homo sapiens artifacts and informative plaques about the progression of human development, much of which happened in the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya. Photos are",
          "The museum is modest but well organized. I visited twice and each time had a wonderful experience that included history dating back to the biblical era.... visiting \u201cLucy\u201d and \u201cArdi\u201d was a treat too! The total area spoke to my interest in politics and political intrigue. The",
          "The basement section was very interesting with the remains of 'Lucy' shown and so was the collection of imperial furniture and picture collections on the ground floor.",
          "The problem with this website is that these star ratings are subjective and based on what the competing sources of entertainment are. I'm giving this four stars because it's worth seeing Lucy, as dozens of other reviewers have said and some of the art is pretty impressive, but",
          "House of Lucy & Real Testament of Ethiopia This museum represents what Ethiopia has remaining of its prized history and past archaeological treasures following the notoriously ruthless Portuguese and Italian rule. The fact that a place like this exists when Ethiopia experienced",
          "If you have EVER heard about EVOLUTION it's a must see. The museum holds one of the oldest skeleton of an ancestor of ours - Lucy, an Australopithecus. There is also a great excibiton of modern Ethiopian heritage",
          "If you want to learn about and experience the history of Ethiopia, then the National Museum of Ethiopia is where you must go. Everything is well displayed and clearly explained. I have now been through the museum 3 different times now and always make it a point to go there with",
          "The museum is not very big, but certainly contains a lot for the size and price of 10 Birr. Lucy is certainly the main attraction, but there are other archaeological findings in there which are also very cool. The bottom floor is about the archaeological and human evolution",
          "I went there with a guide (not one of the museum) who was helpful and informative but at least the \"human evolution\" displays have good English signage, and without a guide, you will still get a good understanding. For someone like me who already has some knowledge of Lucy & Co,",
          "Small Museum with limited items to display with no guid to give you a tour there. Any way worth a visit and have a potential",
          "Of course you have to come and see Lucy, but it is somewhat disappointing in the display. More ethnographic stuff here as well as Art.",
          "Very interesting and inexpensive to visit. Smell very dusty though, but Lucy is worth it. Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Security good.",
          "Renowned for displaying Lucy\u2019s fossil, this was a museum we had been long looking forward to. It was unclear in our reading though whether the skeleton displayed was the real skeleton or one of the duplicate casts. There was unfortunately no mention of this at the museum itself",
          "This is the \"Lucy Museum\" that hosts a nice and explanatory exhibition of the first humanoids in the cellar with Lucy, here Dinkinesh, as the main attraction. On the entrance floor there is a small exhibition of all the leaders of Ethiopia, including Mengistu, with the usual",
          "The museum is worth your time for the Lucy fossil alone. It's somewhat modest in size but there are definitely other interesting items here - artwork, musical instruments, etc. When we visited, the individual exhibits were poorly marked. We were very glad to be there with a",
          "Museum itself is not so special but respect the effort. Lucy was nice to see and the floor with local art was definitely worth seeing.",
          "I visited this important museum whilst on a transit visa ( less than 24 hrs) with my husband. With Addis Ababa being the major hub for Ethiopian Airlines quite a lot of tourists transiting to some other destination have quite a few hours to spend in Addis Ababa so the Museum is",
          "The national museum is a definite \"must see\" if you want to better understand the history of Ethiopia. The people at the museum were respectful and kind. I especially appreciated the artifacts from the imperial history of Ethiopia. The artwork on display are all of great",
          "There's not much here, surprisingly for a national museum. The carpet is threadbare and torn. The lights went out twice during my 30-minute walk in the museum.",
          "The National Museum should attempt to be world class. It is quite dingy, dark - to protect the exhibits. It should be much better than it is. Lucy is a replication, research being undertaken on the original, I was told. This isn\u2019t the situation in other parts of the world. This",
          "We went purely to see Lucy , but there is plenty more history to see here . Unfortunately we arrived a little late ( due to the horrendous traffic ) and the museum has a strict closing time of 5pm. So we were a little rushed . We will definitely go back to see more of the",

          "The big nation of Ethiopia has a rather modest national museum. Ok, it has a Lucy replica (though the texts about homini are already outdated), some pots and related historical stuff. After 15 minutes I recognized that this was enough to visit this place: I liked the outside",

          "The museum is small for a national museum, but the facility is clean. The organization is somewhat befuddling as it isn't explicitly clear how one should migrate from each exhibit to the next as you start from the bottom floor and work up. Seeing Lucy in person is an incredible",

          "Ethiopia has lots of history, cultural and rich and unique artefacts. Unfortunately, because it is a poor country, it does not have all the means to promote the latter as it shoud be. You shoud still visit this museum if you are in Addis Abada, you will see Lucy, but you will",
          "Good information for its size. There was a tour guide that had just started explaining the artifacts so we tagged along. Worth visiting if you are in Addis.",
          "This public museum has a fee of 10 Birr per person. The place is in 4 floors fullof information. The best one is the one in the basement. You will learn a lot about the evolution of man and animals. It is worth visiting. They are open on Saturdays too.",
          "Had 2 visits to this museum. The first was getting to know Lucy with a very interesting layout and finding out there are older remains. The second visit i really looked at the paintings on the third floor. Just fantastic art work although I\u2019m still a bit perplexed with the",

          "It's a simple museum and probably not more than an hour, but very nice and a relaxing way to spend an afternoon before/after a meal perhaps. At the entrance fee (10Birr for foreigners), it's worth it more than once, I imagine. The Lucy and other human remains are kind of",
          "For a national museum, this was a bit of a disappointment. The ground floor displays some assorted pieces of clothing and the huge (and not beautiful) throne of Haile Selassie and the upper floor more modern pieces. The really worthwhile part of the museum, hwoever, is the",

          "It seems like a must visit museum when you are in Addis. Surprisingly, the place is free to enter. You are able to see remains of some prehuman creatures, like Lucy. Also there is an exposition on Ethiopian cultural heritage, which was quite interesting to see. My highlight was",
          "The main attraction at the National Museum is Lucy, the famous skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis. There is quite a bit more to hold your interest, however. Lucy is just part of a much larger hominid exhibit. There are some impressive art pieces on the 1st floor as well.",
          "This museum is full of interesting information about the evolution of man and the history of Ethiopia, but it's dusty, dated, and decrepit. It's definitely worth going to see the early skeletons--especially the famous Lucy!--but the rest of the museum needs an upgrade in",

          "Its a small museum which has as its star the bones of Lucy all 3m years of her from which all of us come from. Be aware that the power goes the whole time in the city and when this happens the museum has to close. My advice is to double job this visit with one or two other",

          "The National Museum has a good collection. Their paleontology section has a great collection and is well described. All other sections are poorly described. You just have to use your imagination. The fee is about $1, so might as well give a visit.",
          "I would rank this as THE top museum in Addis just because of Lucy. It seems the Etnological museum is worth visiting, but we decided on this one and the Red Terror Martyrs museum. Happy with these choices.",
          "The museum is an interesting place to learn about evolution. It was especially exciting to see Lucy and other early humanoid skeletons. Although Lucy wasn\u2019t as complete as i thought she\u2019s be, it was still an eye opener to see the first ever discovered humanoid. The other",

          "The highlight of this museum is the replica of the 3.5 million year old skull of 'Lucy'. Her discovery in 1974 proved that our ancestors were walking earlier than we had thought.There are also some interesting stone statues of females. The museum is laid out well with most of",
          "This place is a main attraction in the city. Start downstairs with Lucy if you wanna best the crowds/school kids. It\u2019s affordable and easy to navigate. The Lucy restaurant next door has great food that\u2019s varied and has a nice atmosphere.",

          "At times the lighting was poor, and the interpretitive signs were not always translated or even present. It seemed like the museum is under-funded based on the condition of the displays and the building. Nevertheless I am very glad I went. I learned a lot and increased my",
          "It is worth checking out to see Lucy. Although Lucy's display could be upgraded with better display and lightning. The rest of the museum can be skipped if you are limited on time. There are some nice contemporary paintings that are admirable, if you are into that art.",

          "My favorite part of this museum was the 3rd floor (I think). The artwork was amazing! I wanted to buy some. I would love to have seen lots more Ethiopian culture artifacts. They had several archeological artifacts dated over 1 million years old! Human beings evolved from Africa!",
          "Going to Ethiopia without visiting Lucy is like going to Rome and not seeing the Pope. Can\u00b4t miss it.",
          "The museum is full and interesting, with the copy of the original \u2018 Lucy\u2019 skeleton the centrepiece. It lacks the things that you associate with modern \u2018 tours\u2019 of such facilities, but that can be refreshing in its own way. It gets busy but hardly over subscribed.",
          "This place is great, but my pictures are not great because most pieces are in glass cases. Lots of history and information on the beginning of mankind!",
          "This is a very interresting museum to visit, and it includes for example a copy of the \u201dLucy\u201d bones. (The real one is hidden in the cellar for safety reasons). It has a lot of pictures and items from Ethiopian history, kings and culture. Though the museum is rich of items I",
          "It would have been weird to visit Addis Ababa without seeing Lucy. And there she was. And in general the visit in the museum was pleasure.",
          "I hope the Ethiopians will get back all their historic evidence to show the world what is could have been.",
          "We went during a time there were large tour groups. So it as a bit crowded but still worth a visit. Lucy was in the basement and that level was almost empty when we went down to it. We were able to take photos(which was nice) but don\u2019t use the flash. Many nice and easily",
          "The artefacts were very interesting and I was excited to see Lucy. I went with a large group along with our tour guide. It was quite when we visited and I also felt safe as we went through security at the gate. Toilets were not clean but the museum itself was.",
          "The place in itself isn\u2019t so exiting but the fact that they are having the oldest person, Lucy there is very cool. Recommend!",
          "I am going to say something I hope is not misunderstood \u2014 but this museum is profoundly disappointing. The most famous and important woman in the world is there \u2014 Lucy\u2014 and she\u2019s down in the basement, poorly lit. You cover floor after floor of dusty unappreciated art, there is",
          "Some people list the price as very expensive, but the real entrance fee is only 10Birr each (about 4 cents). The basement level contains real archeological history and the remains found of \"Lucy\" the oldest human uncovered at the age of 3.2 million years. It is hard to",
          "For a national museum, this is unnecessarily shabby. However, the basement exhibition is interesting and, of course, here is where you can come to see the famous Lucy bones.",
          "Not very well presented, exhibits weren't all clearly marked.The best part of the visit was Lucy, not much else of great interest.",
          "Hands down one of the most interesting museums I have seen. Not because its very well maintained but because of articles that are kept there. Archaeological finds dating back millions of years, interesting weaponry that Ethiopian emperors used to wear and some very nice murals",
          "We spent a few hours going floor to floor enjoying the information and artifacts on display a the National Museum of Ethiopia. We viewed the bones of Lucy ( on the bottom floor) and the clothing of warriors and throne of Emperor Hailee Selassie. If your in Addis Ababa you want",
          "A few hours spent here with a good guide filled me with the history of not only Ethiopia \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf9 and it\u2019s emperors, kings and queens but the incredible Lucy. The displays are African and not up to the highest standards but it\u2019s all about the quality of exhibit and the history of",
          "The museum has interesting things but the infrastructure needs an upgrade and the displays need to be arranged to coherently tell more stories of this amazing country.",
          "It was old museum. There were many school students when I visited. I believe it will be better when they improve display system as it was not so informative.",
          "Get up close with Lucy and some other bones related to the development of humankind. Other floods have more recent, including present day objects.",
          "I found seeing Lucy an incredibly moving experoence and that whole section devoted to evolution and prehistory is fascinating and informative",
          "I had a really good time here and it was very educational and entertaining and very affordable as well but it was quite small compared to most national museums I\u2019ve been to in other countries and really that\u2019s all that I had a problem with everything else was great",
          "Definitely a place to check out if your in Addis... a lot of cool things to check out and Lucy is there...",
          "You have to adjust your expectations a bit, but once you take into account of the incredible treasures in this space, you'll not mind the shabby carpets or the poorly lit conditions. Ethiopia has an incredible history and this is just a glance at what has traversed her land.",

          "This place is very interesting. I would not come to Ethiopia and pass this up. It was 10 Birr to enter and they have a lot of artifacts, art and of course Lucy! The lines weren\u2019t long to get in and perhaps because it was during raining season, we were able to move around with",

          "Great place to learn the origin of human kind. Staff are welcoming and friendly,with a willing heart to tour around and explain in detail",
          "Neat museum with the skeleton of Lucy there showcased. A LOT of Ethiopian history there as well if you\u2019re interested in the rich history of the country. Highly recommend for travelers who\u2019ve never been to Ethiopia before and want to learn a bit more.",
          "we visited the museum mainly to see Lucie that is displayed in the basement that is very interesting and very well done. on the upper floors we particularly liked the part related to the history of Ethiopia and its religions and different ethnicities. the Gallery was average",
          "The national museum has some nice pieces. It is not set up in a very nice way. Little explanation on the art pieces and no history of ethiopia. Museum mostly revolves around some bones from Lucy, a very old homo sapiens..",

          "The highlight of the museum are Lucy and Ardi, two of the oldest relatively intact hominid skeletons ever discovered. The power was not working on floors 2 and 3 while we visited so visitors were restricted to the basement and ground floor, but it was still definitely worth the",
          "So many great artifacts but the displays are dated and the overall atmosphere is dreary. 2 hours is plenty of time here. Keep an eye on valuables as there were two characters who were asked to leave the museum as they seemed to be stalking the group I was with.",
          "Last time I was in Ethiopia (2017), this Museum was undergoing much needed renovations (at long last! My 1st visit there dates back to December 2011). I was always saddened to see treasures such as the throne of one the country's oldest emperor covered with dust - its shine a",

          "Lucy is the highlight but they also have nice other artifacts and a good way to learn about Ethiopia\u2019s history , I think it would be an important place to visit.",
          "Great museum, especially downstairs where Lucy is as there is more explanation about the different objects. Easy to get to, 10 minute walk from arat kilo",
          "Could have been so good but it was not. The lighting and quality of displays were disappointing. Sure Lucy is in the basement and you can get a glimpse of her when the iphones batteries fail. Not much care in the displays.",
          "They have all of the original bones - Lucy - everything. Its not the biggest museum, but I've gone twice now and both times it was worth the visit...",
          "Impressively small for the National Museum of such a large and historically significant country. Items there are not well preserved except for the bones of Lucy. Takes an hour or less to see.",
          "I guess everyone who visits Addis needs to see Lucy, the famous skeleton found by Leaky. I was underwhelmed - but I did enjoy the display of famous emperors of Ethiopia, with all their finery.",
          "No trip to Addis Ababa is complete without visiting this museum and its star, Lucy. (Lucy is 40% of a complete skeleton comprised of bone fossil fragments, representing the hominin species, a bipedal and upright marvel from over 3 million years ago. The museum is two floors,",
          "We booked a tour with Imagine Tours and had a chance to visit this historical museum!! It was very informative and quite interesting to know the evolution of the human species through the discovery of \u201c Lucy\u201d! A lot of artifacts were displayed and very much appreciated! However,",
          "Small but full of great archeological artifacts, religious relics, art, and more. Video and photography are allowed.",

          "The highlight is the exhibition to humanoid forms. It is well laid out, although a bit dark and could do with some more light on the descriptions. The rest ok",
          "In this museum are the remains of the world famous Lucy. So it's a must visit for that reason. The museum itself needs some work.",
          "Normally do not entertain Museums, but we really enjoyed our visit, the guide was very knowledgeable which made the trip interesting",
          "This is an interesting museum that provides a good overview of the history and cultures of Ethiopia . I would advise to spend 1-1.5 hours. Good local English speaking guides are available",
          "The museum is a little rough around the edges. However, the great and long history of Ethiopia is displayed well. Definitely, a place to see if you find yourself In Addis Ababa.",
          "It is a museum, which is a \u2018must\u2019 for Ethiopia visitors although it is unfortunate that the museum currently faces electricity problems and therefore only part of the exhibition is accessible, and yet still providing some good insight of Ethiopia's history, and the entrance fee",
          "The entrance fee is cheap but you may find the place is not well organized. Many people visit to meet \"Lucy\" the oldest human remain found in Ethiopia, but you may be disappointed after look at. The whole display of the artifacts needs more organized and presentable for the",
          "..but interesting the Famous Lucy is here! the museum is not big but there is some beautiful things , paintings, royal portraits, furnitures..etc the display is in poor shape like the building but it s worth it to go",
          "Some of the exhibits are very dark , some have no labelling . Still the museum is well worth a visit . It has a wonderful range of tribal artifacts , farming equipment and Ethiopian history . Very cheap to enter , it should be on any travellers visit list",
          "From April 10-19/2018 i traveled to northern Ethiopia for a vacation to see the historical,religious and natural attractions of the region. I was so happy with the trip and i got a life time experience . I think this partially because Ethiopia is the least discovered and",
          "The museum show a lot of interesting material, although the displays lack good information and sometimes no information at all. But the main attraction is off course Lucy! I would definitely recommend a visit.",

          "The material in the museum is impressive, with lots of rich archeological information and displays. As has been reported before, the displays lack good information and sometimes no information. Lucy and Ardi are not displayed equal to their importance, both to Ethiopian history",
          "The highlight of the National Museum is undoubtedly 3.2 million year old \"Lucy\", the skeletal remains of an Australopithecine hominid that was discovered in eastern Ethiopia in 1974. Lucy walked upright and it is fascinating to see not only the real bones but also a skilful",
          "Lucy is here. Small bones found and believed to be very very old. The museum is interesting. Kinda dusty. 4 floors. Uneventful. Nice staff.",
          "To be honest, very disappointed with the layout, presentation and information. Not many exhibits and those that are there were dusty and in poor condition. Only need to allow a couple of hours to look around.",
          "I\u2019m not a history type of guy, but this was a brilliant visit and only cost Br10br (USD 0.27! Yes that IS correct!!).

          "Got to see \"Lucy\" up close and learned more history about Ethiopia. Some displays of previous king's items. Small museum and not well lit for some of the displays. Cheap entry fee, 10 birr.",
          "Whilst not comparable with many of the museums we are used to in Europe, the National Museum is still a must when in Addis Ababa. It is quite small and very basic but the ground floor does offer a lot of interesting information and displays, on archaeological and",
          "Ok so LUCY is not the oldest bones..and these are not the real ones. This is a replica. Um..i should have known that but my quide reminded me. My Ethiopian guide was very proud to tell the history of this country and how they are the only state in Africa that was not defeated by",
          "A fantastic exhibition, really interesting and educational! A great museum with pieces of amazing world history.",
          "It is as cheap as chips to get in here (10 bihr) so great value. There are four floors to the museum and it won't take long to get round - An hour is about right. Some of the artefacts would benefit from a bit of tlc and a lot of it is dusty, but at the end of the day people are",
          "Very interesting museum and fascinating to see \"LUCY\". The museum (the basement of the museum) is excellent with clear description of discoveries.",
          "For a very modest entry fee you can see the skeleton of the world famous Lucy! The basement displays of archeological remains are simple and well done though poorly lighted. The rest of the museum could use a facelift, but it is Lucy who steals the show. Definitely worth a",
          "While the entire building and exhibits are tired and dusty a visit to see our early ancestral hominids is very special. The information presented ishould be of interest to all.",
          "We ended up going twice....mostly for something to do for an 8-year old. But enjoyed it overall. Only visited the basement level on the 2nd trip.",
          "A very small museum for a National one. I saw more history at Axum Museum were are a lot of golden crones from former kings.",
          "The only reason to come here is to see the famous Lucy. The museum is small, but the ground floor does have a pretty good exhibit of paleontology and the ancient history of humans. The other floors concentrate on Ethiopia and is very basic.",
          "Not quite as good as the Ethnological Musuem but still one of the better museums in the country, lots of variety. Of course Lucy and some other artifacts are major attractions but they could do a better job of displaying them. Some displays have decent explainations in English",
          "There is no reason not to go. It doesn't take long or cost much. I never thought I'd say this, but, they need to raise the ticket price. The ticket price of 10birr is nothing. They should charge 100 birr(or more), and use the money to maintain the exhibits.",
          "Just visit Lucy made Ethiopia trip worthhwhile. The first ancestor of humankind. They need to brush her up with some fancy exhibition though.",
          "The museum is tatty and very run down. I think the last lick of paint it got was prior to opening. The ground floor is very interesting & we laid out but it seems they've put all their eggs in one basket with the ancient bones as the rest if it a dump.",
          "If you have some time, you can go for Lucy, the throne of Hayle S\u00e9lassi\u00e9 & some other pieces. Limited collection (\"this is the National Museum!\") & badly exposed.",
          "The museum has probably seen better times but there is a lot of interesting stuff displayed. I especially enjoyed the display of Lucy. It is relatively cheap to go there and you can spend anything from 15 minutes to 2-3 hours in there. Worth going.",
          "A fascinating repository of anthropology, archeology, Ethiopian history and culture, the National Museum is a \u2018must see\u2019. Although it could use some updating, it is a very informative and compelling place to visit.",
          "The museum is divided into different exhibitions. Lucy is located on the basement floor with other pre-historic exhibition. I particularly like the basement floor as it is informative and well organized. You can easily spend 45 min to 1 hr going through the basement.",
          "Always been a wish of mine to see Lucy after reading so much over the years. The history of Ethiopia and one of our ancestors is well described. Excellent on that basis. The other floors are also interesting but need a description of the items on show. But still",
          "Lovely museum with much of interest including the famous remains of \"Lucy\" One can learn much about the country and Africa as a whole in this place",
          "Due to some electricity defect the second and third floor of the museum were closed. The first floor's main exhibit is the emperor's room with the throne of Haile Selassi. I remember him sitting on it. He was just a very little man and the throne is huge. All artifacts in this",
          "Bit depressing really, very dusty and dirty, we went mainly to see Lucy which was interesting only because we our guide made it interesting. Upstairs we viewed the throne of Haile Selassie and memorabilia from other rulers but, as previous reviewers have commented, nothing",
          "Unfortunatley this museum is in need of some TLC - simple things like having a house style for graphics and having all objects properly anotated. However, do not let that put you off there is plenty to learn as you wend your way around the exhibits. I for example did not know",
          "We went for Lucy and I am happy we did. The museum does have some interesting historical artifacts. However, I was surprised by how dusty and poorly maintained some of them were. This place could use a good deep cleaning. There were local school children there working on an",
          "A few bone pieces can mean a lot to the curious traveller. It is amazing how much an anthropologist can tell about humans ancestors. Problably Lucy was an adult, but she was 12 years old when she died. It is absolutely sure that she could walk upright. Her small body was about",
          "I was so excited to see this place. They have Lucy and Salam there!! It s very nice!! But place is not kept clean, most of items are dusty and there is no explanation on almost any of them. They should really do something about it before dust destroy the items!!",
          "Lucy is about all that we needed to see here. We left wondering why we went but in after thought we are glad we did. It is sparsely filled and relies on the pieces of the skeleton that are real to make a museum. Should go just to see her.",
          "It's not a bad museum but not the most exiting either. I think it's worth going if you have the time but if you miss it, it's not like you you will miss anything super exiting.",
          "Good value to enter at 10 birr. Interesting exhibits but poorly labelled and layer out. Worth a visit but does not require much more than an hour.",
          "After being stopped and sort of patted down by security, you drive up to the main building and your first impression is .....\"REALLY?\" The physical building is in very poor condition and inside is dark and dusty with the exhibits obviously poorly maintained. However, it costs",
          "Visitors beware. Both Lucy and the baby\u2019s skeketons are NOT original, they are replicas. That said, it is worth feeling the weight of ages in this modest museum, also quite visited by locals",
          "Very interesting and educative. Many amazing exhibits that give you a good sense of Ethiopia. But sad to see the situation it is in",
          "Authorities need to plan a new and efective way to display all the treasures. As usual in Ethiopia maintenance is terrible poor.",
          "This is a relatively small museum but the basement which is dedicated to archaeology and paleontology is fascinating with excellent and extremely well written explanations on the development of the human species. While the focus is always on Lucy in the splendour of her one",
          "A really nice museum with some really good exhibits about human origins. The highlight being \u2018Lucy\u2019 in the basement. Unfortunately it seems to have been a bit neglected over time with no real flow or clear explanation or labelling at times. When we visited there were empty",
          "Entrance to the museum was 10 Birr and I instantly headed towards the \u201cLucy Replica\u201d exhibit.Excellent museum explaining the origins of human as well as evolution of various animal species. The museum had three floors, a basement, ground floor, first floor and second floor.",
          "A rather neglected place. Interesting displays but the place is not cleaned well. The other section was closed for renovations",
          "This museum had quite an extensive collection that was very interesting. It wasn't laid out particularly well but there is so much interesting stuff to see it still makes for a very interesting stop. There were a lot of fossils not just Lucy, which were very interesting to see",
          "It's a bit small for the national museum, with 2 floors and a basement. The real exciting things are in the basement showing the evolution of beings and the history of all living. The parts of skeleton of Lucy is also present which, as of now, is the first fully erect walking",
          "Amazing items displayed in terrible conditions. Interesting notwithstanding but needs major refurbishment",
          "Very good museum for Lucy and other early humanoids discovered in Ethiopia. The Lucy on display is actually castings of the bones that were found and missing parts were filled in in a blue color to represent what her complete structure would have looked like.",
          "The National Museum of Ethiopia is a nice compact museum that has a nice permanent exhibits on Ancient life (the famous 4.5 million year old fossil of Lucy); tribal life; ethnic paintings and sculptures.",
          "Lucy seems like such an amazing thing t see, but the setup of this museum is very bad, you kinid of walk around the basement with no direction and then BAM there is Lucy, just in a display case They need to take a class on museum curatorship - its a shame this place is a",
          "Arrived on an afternoon not much time before closing. There are 4 floors Started downstairs where I spent most of the time as a Paleontology and natural history fan, there's a lot about human evolution and its very informative. Lucy is a highlight of course but there's more.",
          "This is one of the main attractions in addis since the oldest mummy is kept here. It shows lots of history about ethiopia.",
          "Even though the museum is not a big location and doesn\u2019t require long time to visit, it is a great tourist attraction and a great place to learn about the beginning of humanity. I enjoyed the trip there and actually felt that i learned more than i knew before going in there.",
          "While not the biggest or most impressive museum in the world, it does have an incredible collection of ancient Ethiopia, notably \"Lucy,\" the oldest set of human remains ever found. Lucy does not disappoint!!",
          "Museum is quite small and easy to check. Lucy is really the big star. Because of her it is worth to visit.",
          "Compared to the 100 BR (and even 200) for other museums the National Museum charges just 10 BR to get in. Whilst this may seem admirable, the lack of funding is reflected in the upkeep. Proper charges would mean more funds available to provide proper upkeep inside and out. Rant",
          "The museum has a rather precarious conservation. The most interesting part is the one with the archaeological remains, specially Lucy. It needs more preservation and more explanations written in English.",
          "The museum itself is easy to find and access. The bottom floor is where the fossils and Lucy resides. Very small exhibit, but interesting to see. The entire museum took less than an hour.",
          "The National Museum is a definite must, at least if you have any interest in the history of the humankind. Here you follow the development of homo -species and see some of the rare and unique findings in real. It is humbling to look at the remains of our ancestors, millions of",

          "How could you go to Addis Ababa and not see the archeological findings at the National Museum, the oldest human remains found to date in the world? Yet, the collection looked like it hadn't been attended to in 40 years--ripped up and worn, faded carpet, torn paper signs. Very",
          "This is an easy to access stop and the museum is small but complete. Four floors with Lucy on the bottom floor, for 3.2 million years old gal, she's holding together well. This is why they say welcome to your country of origin when you visit Ethiopia.",
          "Apart from Lucy there was very little to see. We had an afternoon to spare, and decided to see this museum. The museum needs to spend more funds to maintain their exhibits or else dust and mold will take over.",
          "Sometimes people forget that this is a poor country and expect standard in museums to be as they are in developed countries. Yes, some exhibits are not that well lit and yes, some of the backdrops are dreary. But look beyond this and what a treasure trove it is. The basement",
          "If we take it as \"given\" that there are no fancy displays and interactive display boards , and accept that this is an old style museum , then the actual contents of this museum make it a great place to visit. The layout is compact and over a few floors there is a fascinating",

          "The museum in its present state is a disgrace by any standards. The most interesting part would be the prehistoric exhibit in the basement, but half the lighting does not work so you cannot see what is inside some of the exhibit cases, and the Ardi and Lucy skeletons (and most",

The one thing that I did not enjoy was the state of some of the artifacts. If they keep them with all this dust they will not survive very long. We really need to donate some money here.",

          "Interesting museum. Not in a very nice area though",
          "Very good for learning the culture and History of Ethiopia. If you get a local guide it is totally worth your while. I learnt alot from this Museum.",

          "I love it Good Guides very knowledgeable and friendly I had unforgettable experiences",
          "While more lighting and attention to cleaning would be helpful (the bathroom was really unacceptable), overall the museum is quite well maintained. The natural history and human prehistory exhibits were well done but could use better \u2026",
          "Still need to do bit more work on the exhibits. They were dusty. Plus, the explanation is not possible because it's in Amharic. Overall the biggest thing is Lucy",
          "Fantastic museum. Keeps Authentic instruments both of work and ornament throughout history and prehistory in Ethiopia. Bones of Lucy and other ancestros are Borth the visit. Many explicative panels are of much help for better understanding",

          "Update needed. THE place to actually see Lucy, which I found quite special. This museum is in dire need for extra funding and a more modern and up to date approach. It's worth visiting when in Addis, but it could be a highlight of an Ethiopia visit if more resources were available.",
          "Great overview of the country. Loved the art gallery especially!",
          "If you visit Addis you should also see the National Museum. Not very big and with some parts not well illuminated compared to European standard, but interesting to understand better the Ethiopian history. I specially liked the prehistorical part with a lot of info and of course Lucy.",

Luckily for us we traveled the north before coming here so it made sense what we were looking at.\nHead to the Lucy restaurant afterwards which is worth it.",

Inside the compound there is also another building dedicated to art exhibitions, also a nice place for art lovers.",

          "Being the National Museum, I found it to be a bit shallow on the history of such a culturally rich nation. The museum is as well quite small and other than the fossils, the other displays are unimpressive. On the flip side, entry fee is very minimal giving no reason for anyone to skip a tour.",

        "wiki": "Addis Ababa University (AAU) (Amharic: \u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12a0\u1260\u1263 \u12e9\u1292\u1268\u122d\u1232\u1272) is a large, highly residential national university in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The university is the oldest school of higher education in Ethiopia. AAU has thirteen campuses. Twelve of these are situated in Addis Ababa, and one is located in Bishoftu, about 45 kilometres (28 mi) away. AAU has several associated research institutions including the Institute of Ethiopian Studies. The Ministry of Education admits qualified students to AAU based on their score on the Ethiopian University Entrance Examination (EUEE).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origins of AAU was a two-year college in 1950 by the Jesuit Lucien Matte, at the appeal of His Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie I. It began operations the following year. Over the following two years an affiliation with the University of London was developed.\nThe nucleus of AAU was formed with the establishment of the University College of Addis Ababa (UCAA) in 1950. UCAA, which initially consisted of the Faculties of Arts and Science, became a fully fledged college when it was chartered in 1954. In 1955, the Building College was opened. In February 1961, these various colleges and the Theological College were brought together to form the Haile Selassie University. Emperor Haile Selassie I gave his Guenete Leul Palace to serve as the administration building and main campus. He had abandoned the palace, where a number of his ministers and favorites were killed in the wake of the abortive Coup d'\u00e9tat in 1960, in favor of the new Jubilee Palace. Following the 1974 revolution, the university was briefly renamed University of Ethiopia (National University) before it came to assume its present designation, AAU, in 1975. In the wake of the revolution, AAU was closed for two years and students and staff were drafted into what was known as the Development through Cooperation Campaign (zemecha), designed to arise the awareness of the rural population in the spirit of the revolution. The university offered its first Master's programs in 1979 and its first PhD programs in 1987.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nUntil 1974 the charter provided for a governance structure in the following descending order or authority: Chancellor (the Emperor himself); the Board of Governors, composed of ministers and members of the royal family; and the Faculty Council, made up of the university officers, deans, directors and elected members. The Faculty later became the Senate. In 1977, the AAU lost its relative autonomy when it was brought under the Commission for Higher Education, which came to exercise administrative jurisdiction over all institutions of higher learning. In 1993, AAU was placed under the Ministry of Education by a government proclamation. \n\n\n== Influence ==\nOver and above their academic  pursuits, AAU students have been actively engaged in community service (such as conducting literacy programs) and political struggle, particularly in the years before the 1974 revolution. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, students were required to do a year of national service under the Ethiopia University Service program. University teachers and students were instrumental in exposing the hidden 1973 famine and launching the first famine relief program. The Ethiopian Student Movement, of which the University was the birthplace and main venue, played a pivotal role in bringing about the revolution. Almost all leaders of the political organizations that were active in the revolutionary years or are in power now had their political formation inside the University. In 2013/2014, there were 33,940 undergraduate students, 13,000 graduate students, and 1,733 PhD students, making a total student body of 48,673.\n\n\n== Campuses and colleges ==\n\n\n=== Colleges ===\n\n\n=== Research and teaching institutes ===\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\n\n== Notable dropout ==\n\n\n=== Prime Ministers ===\nMeles Zenawi (1995-2012)\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAddis Ababa University official website\nInstitute of Ethiopian Studies and the Ethnological Museum\nContact information for Addis Ababa University, and 28 Ethiopian institutions of higher education in the African Higher Education Database",

          "Informative place around the time of Menguist government the communist era in 1991 they discovered all the atrocities done by his government the death of students and members of TPLF entrance fee is cheap.",
          "I appreciate that this museum exists. It's a really important part of modern Ethiopian history and the fact that it's funded and maintained by survivors is wonderful. However, the museum itself is hard to make sense of--the lights weren't working and the information is not",
          "Great way to get a sense of the country\u2019s history and feel the impact it had on the people. The tour was conducted by a survivor and the artwork was done by other survivors.",
          "A place that reminds every one that Ethiopia had to go through this terrifying experience where there was a lot of injustice.",
          "It's not a big museum and it needs some upgrading but it sure does provide a lot of history and information. The skeletons and clothing of people massacred were also on display.",
          "A stark memorial to a terrible time in Ethiopia. It is amazing how cruel we can be to each other over and over again.",
          "I was so very, very glad I went to this museum. It clearly presents the politics of the country for the 75+ years, and I left there having a much better understanding of recent Ethiopian history (and empathy for what its people have suffered through). If you've read the",
          "This is an impactful and important museum founded by a woman who lost four sons in the red terror. You'll walk through the history and see the actual bones and clothes of the young people who were captured, tortured, and murdered by Mengistu and the Derg Up to half a million",
          "Mostly photographs. Museum could use proper exhibits and organization. We were not pressured to donate.",
          "This is a good place to get an idea of this very sobering time of history. I have taken tour groups here and everyone has been surprised how they never knew about this part of the history of the nation.",
          "Really interesting place to visit. Such sad history. Displays are basic but you get the fist. Would be great to have more signage that gives a timeline or brief overview. Free entry but do leave a donation to support the museum and to help them improve. I thought it was worth a",
          "This museum is similar to the genocide museums in Kigali and Cambodia with lots of eerie photos of victims. Definitely a Cold War vestige. I recommend reading up on that era before going.",
          "The museum is somewhat basic in its layout, however, with great intention and most importantly, with the help of a guide (who are often victims of the regime itself), there is a great oppirtunity to learn about this recent troubled past of Ethiopian history, what led to if and",
          "this place does not charge an entry fee but you can make a donation. (and I would recommend making a generous donation as we understand they dont receive government funding.) we were very moved by this place. we were guided by Fre' who is a survivor of the red terror. his",
          "The presentation is confusing and we had a difficult time understanding what some of the pictures represented... The museum is small and free (with a donation box). Worth visiting, but could be better",
          "A bit hard to follow if you dont have any background on the history behind this. But fascinating and at the same time sad nonetheless",
          "The museum is well crafted, telling the story of the 1974 revolution and subsequent military takeover in historical order. Personal accounts, artifacts and equipment are stored in the museum. If there is an English guide there, make sure to ask for a tour. A guide offered to",
          "The museum pays tribute to the martyrs who were murdered during the Red Terror. I don't think it does a particularly good job of covering the history of the period, how it arose and how it ended. If you have limited time I would skip a visit and rather do some of your own",
          "I was lucky to have read about the DERG regime in my guidebook. Without this previous reading I would have seen many pictures, missing the story behind",
          "They could a better job with it. A couple of things worth seeing. Small venue. The history/stories you read about in the museum, you can find online, without having to visit the museum. No fee to get in, only donations.",
          "I visited the museum late on a Saturday afternoon with a tour. I wish I had of had more time to read more in detail. I went in not knowing much about the Derg rule and left wanting to find out more. A guide walked us through who was a survivor so it was quite a moving",
          "Hey everyone don't forgets to visit red terror museum you can visit the previous government history just don't missing this Cheers",
          "In Addis museum choice is limited but this one is a must if you want to understand more of Ethiopia darker history. I would not recommend for young children without a good dose of explanations. Also there is a room with remains and skulls from some of the martyrs. Visit takes",
          "While the exhibits are quite interesting, the museum is tired and badly maintained. A little tender loving care could work marvels! Nevertheless, it is well worth s visit to enable an understanding of the convulsions that Ethiopia suffered in the latter part of the 20th century.",
          "We were shown round by a lovely man who had been held a prisoner in 70/80\u2019s and to relate the explanations through his experiences was humbling. A very good way to understand a part of Ethiopia\u2019s history.",
          "Ask for the guide to tour you. He has some big surprises on the way. I was extremely touched. It was a very emotional ride. I don't think it's for kids. I hear the museum won't allow anyone younger than 14 years old to enter. You wouldn't want to leave the site without making",
          "The museum is free to enter, however, you can take a guide there who explains you the displayed items (photographs in the majority). The place creates quite a weird feeling when you imagine the horror the people of that times underwent",
          "This is a small, simple, but powerful series of exhibits related to the reign of Red Terror in Ethiopia. I had read that a 'volunteer' English-speaking guide may approach, and I decided to take advantage of his services. He was an excellent guide to this museum, and I was happy",
          "We visited the museum as one of the stops from the Airport. Its a very small museum but packs a punch on the history of the past. It takes about 40 minutes to view everything and afterwards you can visit the near by square. Recommended.",
          "The detail you'll know are more than you've read in travel guides before coming to Ethiopia. Not interesting for kids and teenagers though.",
          "This is a basic museum and free but with donations encouraged. It doesn\u2019t pull any punches with the powerful exhibits and information. Very high impact. Having clothes and skulls with the photos of the victims attached is not something I\u2019ve seen anywhere else. Good",
          "It is the killer Menghistu'story who killed, tortured and abused most of ethiopian people betwee 1974 and 1991",
          "Lovely people run this little museum. We had a lovely chat with the man at the front desk who had lived through this bleak period of Ethiopia's history. Some poignant displays.",
          "Important place. It is very important to tell also about the dark hours... or as in this case, years, of country's history. This is that kind of place. Important, and sad.",
          "So new Africa had turmoil in each country and all I really know about Ethiopia was people suffering from not proper foods. Walking though this free experience and getting an education of this insane event that isn\u2019t classified as genocide is crazy. The only improvement to make",
          "This museum deals with a very dark period of Ethiopia\u2019s history. The brutality is unbelievable. One can only hope that nothing like this ever happens again, anywhere",
          "This free museum is just to the side of Meskel Square and allows a self-guided tour of the uprising and terror as hundreds of Ethiopians were killed by the communist regime. Pictures of the \"most wanted\" and the photos of the dead are on display. In the entrance is a",
          "As a westerner, I knew little about this dark season in Ethiopia\u2019s history. Our guide gave us a step-by-step of the entire museum. He was extremely knowledgeable and made it an unforgettable experience.",
          "If you don\u2019t know the history of genocide in Ethiopia, you will in a half hour visit to this small monument to those who were slaughtered after the fall of Haile Selassie. Our guide was knowledgable and gentle but persistent that we understand the whole picture. I highly",
          "Interesting well laid out museum. I didn't know details about this period in Ethiopian history and this was a good way to understand.",
          "The museum itself is pretty good, although difficult to follow everything in English. But the stretch between the museum and the stadium/train station (to the west) is the worst area for pickpockets in the city. It's not even really subtle, just kids constantly grabbing at you.",
          "Well worth the visit. This museum tells of the downfall of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and the rise of the Derg. The Derg led by Haile Mengstu a low ranking military officer who purged his rivals using armed civilian illiterates who terrorized the educated population killing",
          "Reminded me a little bit of my visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau in as much as it is a chilling reminder of man's inhumanity to man. Also a fascinating insight into that period of Ethiopian history",
          "The museum had a lot of interesting pictures, but they were very disturbing, so this is probably not a place to take young kids. We had read up on the recent political history in the country so were interested in learning a little more while here. It's a small museum, easily",
          "Located, at the center of Addis Ababa at Meskel Square, this small museum is good one to learn about the SAD HISTORY of especially the Derg (the military Government of Ethiopia from 1974 to 1991). The museum displays photos with information how the time was brutal to hundreds of",
          "Every one, regardless of race or religion should visit this small museum. It is a remainder of brutality and horror committed by fellow men in a name of ideology.",
          "Very good museum, lots of information, artifacts, and art related to the red terror. One portion of the museum included human remains, may want to be vigilant if sensitive to this.",
          "The short tour gave us an insight through the dark period of Ethiopia! The pictures clearly showed what transformed during these years! The personal testimonial of the volunteer staff who guided us was so powerful and emotional that it left us all choked up especially at the",
          "Museum tells a terrible story of a time when ethiopians were against each other. Museum is free (donation is suggested) and most exhibits are old photos and copies of newspapers from that time. That is somewhat powerful but then go to the room at the back and you see the real",
          "For anyone who doesn\u2019t know about the dark chapter of Ethiopia, a visit to this museum is absolutely required. The curator there is incredible and provides you with some interesting, personal insight as to what happened in those dark days.",
          "The terror in the years the Deng regime was in power is a must see for each and every visitor of Addis. It is a small museum. It has a lot of pictures and many are not, or very bad, translated in English. But over all you get an impression of what happened in those years, never",
          "This tells the dark past of Ethiopia. It is shocking what people endured and ultimately those that cost their life. The repercussions are still ongoing today.",
          "A small but well-laid out museum to a very dark period of Ethiopian history. Do some reading on the Derg before you go. A must!",
          "The \u2018Red Terror\u2019 Martyrs' Memorial Museum neighbouring the Addis Ababa Museum and directly located at the Bole Rd/Africa Av., is a grim memory of Ethiopia\u2019s horrid events, which took place about four decades ago. The museum was established in 2010 as a memorial to those who died",
          "The museum offers an alternative view of history during the Derg's infamous reign. My guide pointed out that the institution receives no state funding and is run purely on donations and determination of survivors and victims' families. I expected a nostalgic view of Ethiopia's",
          "The museum is compelling and disturbing. Obviously a sad and terrible chapter in Ethiopian history. But incredible journey through the Derg period. What is missing is a timeline of major events and dates. Before you go read brief history of Ethiopia from 1960 to 1989.",
          "it is the must see in Addis.i had great guide. he was one of the victim of the Derg.very interesting museum that tells you the horrific history of Ethiopia. i recommend to google about the regime before you go",
          "The museum is relatively small and the exhibits are ok. Labels in English could use lots of improvement. It is worth paying a guide to explain the displays. This visit requires no more than one hour max to see everything.",
          "An amazing exhibition, really grasping and awful to see what Ethiopia has been through. Very educational and interesting!",
          "Interesting period of history. Large photos, needs a little more background, but it's a good museum, given that it's a free, donation-based museum.",
          "The \u201cDerg Time\u201d ( as many Ethiopians referred to the years under communism) is important To recognize and remember. not only for Ethiopians but for all citizens of the world. This museum Is great education tool as well as a memorial. If they had turned lights on it would",
          "This museum is so amazing it tells the horrific history of the durg occupation from the 1979 to the early 1990s. This museum takes about an hour to go thought. Do not do this with the tour otherwise you will not under it at all. The tour guides are survivors of this genocide and",
          "Very bard museum but it would be good if people that do not understand the slightest thing about this terrible episode more information and references. I would have suggested more chronological and more information on the characters Apart from that sad to know that so much",
          "The theme of the museum is very much to pay respect to the victims of the Derg regime that followed the feudal imperial reign by Haile Selasssi after a coup in the 1970s and 80s. Convincing evidence is presented including documents by the regime itself, a map with torture",
          "Small, well maintained and powerful museum. We stopped here on our way to the National Museum and it was worth the visit. Spent about 1 hour.",
          "Interesting if you are a war buff. They don't have much money for displays and have done what they can.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. In just a few minutes, you experience the depth of the inhumanity of the terror rained down upon Ethiopians during this dark chapter of their history.",
          "This museum is well organized and the guides have personal experiences to share. It is important that the historical account of the Red Terror is documented, and the reconciliation process preserved. A fair warning: There is one room that contains human remains that is quite",
          "I know just another memorial of Communistic behaviour , sobering as the victims so young.Har to access if walking inpared.",
          "This is a really interesting museum and a good way to see a dark period in Ethiopia's history. It is sadly poorly maintained, and there is no background to help someone unfamiliar with this period of Ethiopian history understand what really occurred. I'd recommend reading up on",
          "A very sad period of the Ethiopian people. Gives you a good sense of the time and what this country went through. Shocking!!!!",
          "The \u201cRed Terror Martyr\u2019s Museum\u201d established in 2010 is situated at Meskel Square. Entrance to the museum is free but its a formality to donate some money into the drop box kept at the entrance of this small museum. The museum depicts a phase of Ethiopian history during the",
          "Do not leave Addis Ababa without visiting this museum. We were warmly greeted by a gentleman who explained a little to us then left us to absorb the history of the past throughout he was there at hand to answer any questions. Don't miss the room where the bones of the victims,",
          "A shocking look at the evils the Derg perpetuated upon the Ethiopian people during their time in power. Seeing multiple display cases of the bones of victims is proof positive of the derangement of Mengistu Haile Mariam. With the ouster of Mugabe in Zimbabwe I would love to see",
          "I visited the museum on November on a solo trip. And I found it to be very history full and educating on Ethiopian history and what country have been through. I would recommend this Museum for tourists to start their tour with a little bit of Education about the country's past.",
          "The topic of the museum is of obvious importance, but the layout is not very well organized. A narrative including background information is missing, the exposed artefacts appears somewhat random, and not a lot of new things appears to be going on. The museum relies on donations",
          "We didn't know much about the history of Ethiopia so this was really valuable for us. The guides all seem to have personal stories of this time in Ethiopia (as I'm sure anyone of a certain age does) which made it even more personal. It was really easy to get to from the",
          "Here visitors will be able to visit the past life of Ethiopian people in the worst time, Here at the museum you will see a lot number of skulls and photographs , cloths and artifacts ... Just visit if you are Habesha only .",
          "Being in the center of the city, the musium is in the center of the city which makes it easy to pay a visit without a program, it worth a visit.",
          "There are a number of photos in this museum but unless you have full knowledge of Ethiopia's history it is out of context. Would benefit from more introductory script however there is no charge (donations only) so worth a visit if you're in the area to encourage future research",
          "Certainly worth a visit but even after I left I was unsure how the \"Red Terror\" actually happened (not that it did happen!) i.e. how did the movement start, grow and collapse? That said, if you take the exhibits one at a time then it is an interesting and in parts harrowing",
          "Our guide was a victim of the Red Terror era, the post-Haile Selassie fascist period when thousands of Ethiopians, especially educated ones, were imprisoned, tortured and killed. Be sure to top (pay, really) for the guided tour. Do not miss this museum.",
          "The entrance is free and the museum is very small, but it offers interesting information about Ethiopian recent history, specially the Red Terror during the Derg government. It is possible to see photos, torture documents, clothes and other things related to the period.",
          "The museum is very small and presents informations over the genocide operated by the Derg military junta after the overthrow of the emperor Haile Selassie. The exhibition presents mainly old pictures (blackwhite), some paintings and a small number of objects. A little bit",
          "Disturbing, well-presented displays dedicated to an important period in modern Ethiopian history. A must for those interested in the roots of current Ethiopia.",
          "I lived through the May 1989 regime change and do not find the muesem a strong enough condemnation of the past. A clear and strong statement that no government, past or present should opress, silence or detain its citizens for polical beliefs.",
          "Visited this small museum in the afternoon. No ticket. Donation at the end if someone willing. Not suitable to visit with children. I was alone in the room where all the skulls, bones, clothes of tortured people were preserved. That gives a mixture of spooky and grief feeling at",
          "while walking around the museum seeing the atrocities, we heard what sounded like a crash, i walked outside as there was screaming and saw that across the road a scaffold had collapsed. not sure if anyone was injured. i hope not.",
          "A well and nicely organised museum about the recent tragic history of Ethiopia and the dictatorial regime of the 80ies. Maybe keeping this for the end of your visit to Addis Ababa.",
          "This Museum is not about Ethiopian history which had happened in the past rather it is the proof that humans, if convinced with some ideology can extinct all there brother from earth. so we should preach Love than hatred!",
          "I wasn't sure I wanted to go here, but and glad I did. The museum is an important memorial to the many Ethiopians who suffered and died during a very dark period of the country's history. Admission is free, but please make a contribution to the ongoing effort.",
          "this museum shows the terror of a former ruler of ethipia where almost half a million is kiiled. if you are a faint hearted, better to avoid. but this museum shows the brutality of ruler. soem of the stories are heartbreaking.",
          "Very welcoming staff, explaining with inside knowledge the terrible years suffered by the Ethipoians between 1974 and 1991. I suggest coupling it with the visit to the Martyrs' Memorial in Mek'ele.",
          "It's simple but good for short visit, especially if you have small children together. It's very central and you can walk around too to see the old Museum",
          "The museum gives an interesting and impressive overview on a part of Ethiopia's history. A recommendation.",
          "Really interesting museum about the darker side of Ethiopian history. Guide brought the place to life. Free entry and guide but leave a donation on the way out.",
          "I was deeply touched by the visit, historical overview of people who killed for freedom, a must see in Addis Ababa.",
          "We found the museum to be very interesting. although small, it had a lot of exhibits illustrating the colourful past of Ethiopia and Addis.",
          "Really moving exhibit of the Red Terror Martyrs. A must when you're in Addis. The guides are survivors of the Red Terror, and the museum is fully funded from donations.",
          "If you are interested in modern Ethiopian history then you must visit the Red Terror museum. It charts Ethiopia's political transition from ruling emperor, then communist military committee (Derg), to the current Federal Democratic Republic. I recommend you tour with one of the",
          "It's small so you'll get through it in max 30min. It was interesting and shocking information on what the Ethiopian people and especially the you suffered in the time of the DERG regime. But you aren't missing anything of particular note if you don't visit. If you are in the",
          "This place is scary. Stay out of it while you can. They have no respect for the dead, having dug up many deceased soldiers for shock value. Stop doing silly and give these souls the grave they deserve.",
          "Well curated and organised. Tells the story of that period with great impact. Would go again. Would suggest reading up a little in advance on Google before going so you are aware of the rough chronology and key events and people.",
          "I recommend doing a little background research on the Derg rule in Ethiopia before going to the museum to give some context, but the place was interesting and well done. It't not huge so don't expect to spend more than an hour or so at the museum.",
          "Words fail. Do not make this part of a tourist itinerary. Small, dirty, disorganized, and poorly narrated. Unless you have previous knowledge of the Red Terror, you will have no idea what's happening at this very strange little museum.",
          "We stumbled upon this while randomly walking around Adis. I never knew what happened in Ethiopia all those years ago and this attraction highlights the brutality of the regime and the barbarous act they committed against the people of Ethiopia.",
          "Outstanding history and paintings A must see to understand the history of the country Does not take a lot of time",
          "A small but must-see museum if you have a genuine interest in Ethiopia, its history and its people, ie those who actually lived the story of Derg terror. One of our taxi drivers was imprisoned by the regime. It\u00b4s sickening stuff however, and not an outing to lighten your mood.",
          "We went here on the first morning of our stay and we're really glad we did. Before coming here I knew very little about the history of Ethiopia. However, the museum is very insightful and it is well worth going round with a guide to get further information on the recent",
          "This is a truly heartbreaking little museum. You leave feeling quite angry. Incidentally, Mengistu is still alive, living in exile in Zimbabwe and rumoured to be helping Mugabe. Don't forget to donate a few birr.",
          "The guide's personal experience gave a very real feel to the terror and helped us understand some of the issues that beset the proud nation.",
          "A guide, ex prisoner and survivor of the Derg era took us through the 20th century history of the country, sharing with us his own experiences. It is an interesting display and a moving story of cruelty which give a good understanding of the late history.",
          "This museum depicts the horrifying historical events that happened to the Ethiopian people by the Derg regime during the mid 70s-late 80s. The displays are not very informative and lack proper explication. Thus, we left the museum confused with the actual chronological order of",
          "Like the others communist and socialist regimes, to his ld themselves in power, they bild up a terror, killing a lot of people and taking the country to a bankruptcy!",
          "the displays and accompanying explanations need to be better so that visitors understand the history better. They don't charge entry but it's a good idea to donate some money to help maintain the place",
          "not a good display. should visit the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg or Yad Vashem in Jerusalem for ideas. one can still see depraved humanity and the cruelty.",
          "This is by far one of the saddest places I have visited in all my years going to Ethiopia - but it tells a story that is very seldom heard. With tours being given by survivors of the Derg and the famine it is heartbreaking to hear these peoples stories. I've had a few different",
          "This was a great place to visit on our trip to Addis. We got a local guide in the museum to show us around, it turns out he was actually tortured under the Communist leadership. They only ask for a voluntary donation of anything you can afford at the end of the tour. There",
          "Another must see to learn about Ethiopia's past... even if it is somewhat propagandist in tone... Easy to get to and easy to see alongside other museums.",
          "It is a very interesting place to visit. With pictures and proper info that really moved us. It is a good place to connect with some of the ethiopian history",
          "These tours are led by former prisoners of the Derg regime. My guide gave a very powerful account of his own experiences and was very knowledgable about the history more generally. Highly recommended.",
          "This was one of the most touching and heart-felt museums in Ethiopia. The museum name accurately depicts terrifying historical events that took place in Ethiopia among its people.",
          "It's probably fair to say this is one of the worst museums I've ever visited in my life, which is a real shame given the horrendous atrocities of the Derg era and the need for a good museum to tell that story.. Unfortunately that's not what you'll find here - the museum lacks",
          "Depicts the sad part of Ethiopian History. This is one of those places worth a visit whenever or if you ever find yourself in Addis Ababa.",
          "The Red Terror Martyrs Memorial Museum is run by very friendly and conscientious staff; however, the absence of a clear explanation of the historical timeline linking the displays makes it almost impossible to grasp the contextual significance of the artefacts without prior",
          "In memory of many, many killed by Derg dictatorship. Movingly emotional, go pay respects and learn if you don't already know about that regime. Free entry, I ask you leave a donation as no government funding. \"Lest we forget\". Not well signed in English but guide available,",
          "Caution - this museum is not for the faint-hearted. It contains graphics and information about a number of terrible events during Mengistu Haile Merriam's reign over Ethiopia. That said, it is an important part of the country's history and should not be overlooked, hidden or",
          "The museum, just off Meskel Square, commemorates the victims of the Red Terror in the late 70's in Ethiopia. The museum depicts the events leading up to the Red Terror, photojournalism, news stories, photos of victims, torture instruments and culminates in a room showing the",
          "The guide lead me through the museum looking at all the photos and memorability of this dreadful time in the more recent history of Ethiopia. I was moved to tears as I found out the guide himself had been a victim of imprisoment for 8 years. Tears were running out of his eyes",
          "It is hard to stand all the facts told by the knowledgeable guide who have himself experienced this time and horror! Take good time to listen and experience the story of Mengistu Haile Mariam and the heinous deeds that he and his regime made towards it's own people. I think this",
          "Decent and evocative museum but isn't as extensive or explanatory as others I've seen in Budapest, Jerusalem and Phnom Penh. Worth an hour at most. Guides add weight to the experience.",
          "Museums about horrible political events and repressive regimes are never going to be cheery, but ensure the past is not forgotten, and people's suffering was not in vain. This museum documents the period of the Derg during which the government tortured, killed and imprisoned",
          "It is spooky seeing skulls and skeleton remains in cages/boxes. They had long bones etc. Also transparent column of pillars with clothes of the killed. They display photos and more. War is ugly everywhere. Let we forget they say never again!",
          "This museum depicts some of the not so pleasant past of Ethiopia. Worth a visit but not for the faint of heart!",

          "This was the museum I appreciated the most in addis. It feels modern and interesting. The thing I missed though was more basic info. I'm not well informed about the history of Ethiopia and it was a bit confusing therefor. I would have loved it if it had more history written down",
          "Before visiting this museum, I did not have much knowledge about the history of Ethiopia, especially during the Red Terror time. I left with a deep appreciation of what the people, the country has been through. The person works at the Museum, Mr. (I forgot his name) has taken",

          "This is a very small museum with not many objects in exhibition. Mostly names and pictures of the victims. Though very sad and after all its free entry.",
          "I understand that this museum is a memorial for Ethiopians who died tragically during the Dirge regime, and it must have a special place in Ethiopians' hearts. I regret to say that, because most of the collections in this museum only have Amharic description, I do not understand",
          "The Mengistu regime must have been the worst, killing innocent students and perceived opponents. It is a moving testimony on why people should never allow tyrants and mad men to rule. Wanton detention, stealing from state coffers and enriching those closest to the regime. Though",

          "The museum is a memorial for all those who died during the red terror in Ethiopia, the dark history. It was definitely interesting and worth seeing. And eventhough I'm Ethiopian myself, I learned a lot information about the important time in history, the information I never",

          "We had a very personal interpretive tour with a well-informed guide who took us through the museum. It provided us with a glimpse of a grim and terrible period in history. Some would say that it provides on side of an historical moment. I am not well enough informed to",

          "one of our highlights- very informative A guide- most of whom are living testament to the history, is a must!",
          "I was deeply impressed and overwhelmed by this museum and the outstanding quality of our guide. One can learn enormously much in a couple of hours about Ethiopia's troubled history at this place. As you will see a lot about the cruel and torturous methods of the regimes it is",
          "Nice miseum who show the Red Terror, a sade and bad time. You can find some details, the place is nice, and the price is you who made it",
          "Very moving and definitely worth a visit to learn about a period of Ethiopian history which doesn't get much attention. There is a free guided tour which is invaluable to understanding the displays.",
          "Very informative. Seeing the terror that humans inflict on humans is heart breaking. This is right at the Mescal Square and if you like to walk, you can walk to Piassa via the old AA-Djibouti Train Station (atmospheric) and Cuba-Ethiopia Friendship Park.",

          "The facility seems more geared towards the Ethiopian visitors, with the signs all in basic English. The museum is not too well-maintained, either. A lot of the exhibits are poorly lit because about half the lights are not functional, and I was informed not to use a flash for",
          "Excellent museum when you take a tour with the staff. Curator has done well. Interesting and informative. As this is relatively recent history the guides are able to relay stories and events from the time to bring the displays to life. Well worth a visit if you wish to",
          "I was very impressive with how this difficult history was presented. The guide is articulate and draws upon first-hand experience as he takes you through the events of the 'Red Terror' including the rise and fall of the Derg regime. A number of photos and exhibits, including",
          "If you are unfamiliar with Ethiopia's past, visit. It's fairly graphic, provides enough info to complement a base understanding of the political history.",
          "This harrowing museum is a must see to better understand this period of Ethiopian history that is little talked about openly. Having a guide (usually a former political prisoner) will give you deeper insights, as the layout of the museum could be improved.",
          "Memorial to victims of the revolution. Photos and artifacts from recent difficult period in Ethiopia's history. Worth the visit.",
          "This museum was the most interesting thing I did in Addis. I didn't know about the red terror movement, and the rise of communism in Ethiopia. It's obviously bias, but the people who work there were detained and tortured during the time. Definitely get a free tour. It's well",
          "I spent the week in Ethiopia to visit the NGO projects with a group of donors from Hong Kong and we went to the museum together on the last day of the trip. Everyone of us was moved and shocked after the exhibition knowing this part of history that actually happened not long",
          "The museum is small, but very informative. For anyone interested in the history of Ethiopia, this is a must. I highly recommend doing the guided tour. The exhibits are well-organized, and you could easily do a self-guided tour. However, the tour guides are individuals who lived",
          "This is a very small exhibition, which certainly helps you to understand the relatively recent atrocities. It is free to go in although obviously a donation is expected. Everything is explained in English, and although a guide is offered, it is not necessary if you prefer to",
          "I was in Addis Ababa during the Red Terror. It was especially interesting for me to see and hear of the history from the point of view of Ethiopians caught in the chaos and brutality. May it remind Ethiopians of a time they wish never to repeat.",
          "This is a must when you visit Addis. There is also a good book shop next to the museum with a good collection of books. The guide had personal experience and lived through this horrendous time in Ethiopia.",
          "The tour guide had personal experience with the subject and was able to tell the story of the Red Terror from his first hand accounts.",
          "I learned a lot that I never knew from this place! Definitely worth a visit! The tour guide in the museum lived through this experience.",
          "This is definitely somewhere to visit to gain an insight into the recent history of Ethiopia and is graphic in it's display.",
          "This is something to see if you want to see what the country has been through. As someone who has lost an uncle to this period of time, i have visited this place many times and still get mesmerized by how much that generation had to go through.",
          "The museum is small but informative and not government owned! I've read a lot about Ethiopia and the Mengistu era (red terror). In my opinion the museum gives a good depiction of the atrocities that took place and also how the revolution failed to improve democracy. However,",
          "You won't need long in here as its only small but its informative and they have lots of items to look at. Quite interesting having a read about their history. No entry fees, just a donation as they maintain it themselves.",
          "nice and good memorial but not well organized and standard museum .the good thing of this museum is if you were any corner of the city you can found it easily",
          "It was one of the more interesting places we visited in Addis. And it's a private museum doing great work to make sure that the horrors of the Mengistu derg are not forgotten.",
          "The museum is small but really packs a punch. It very simply, but powerfully, tells the story of the massacres committed during the Derg regime of the late 70s/80s. The recreation of the torture methods used by the Derg were particularly gut-wrenching. A must visit.",
          "the museum is free but you can make a donation, the stuff are kind people, some how a little graphics contents inside it. it helps travelers how Ethiopian Strong men Dictator Mengistu use to run his bloody rules up on Ethiopians. its a good reminder how bloody the communist era",
          "I felt very ignorant and uneducated to this part of recent Ethiopian history. It's a short but informative look into what occurred during this time. Worth a visit.",
          "Many tourists are unaware of what happened in the years of communist dictatorship in Ethiopia, under Mengistu, until the Soviet Union collapsed and he was defeated by rebels in th early 90s. This is a very explicit account of the cruelty of this period - don't take children",
          "Mostly photographs and materials from the time. The Museum is free and you can make a small donation at the end. Not sure about tours but everything is in English. Unfortunately there is no specific story line, except for the chronological one so if you are not very familiar",
          "Belong to the dark side of Ethiopian history. You will learn alot.Do not miss the museum. I did not know how terrible the people was suffering.",

          "Museum matters. We think the museum is most important and interesting in Addis Ababa. Describes the corrupt government during communist dictator Mengistu Authority.",
          "It's a very small museum and can be completed in less than an hour. However, you come away with some of the history.",
          "A really interesting museum about a time in Ethiopia's history I knew nothing about! I was really moved by the exhibitions and stories. It would have been even better if there was slightly more information to read.",
          "You'd get into the museum like any other museums, to learn the history of the past, a history you would regret it ever happened in the history of humanity. I would call the history in this museum \"Dark Years' History\". It's worth visiting but be ready you'd feel sad because of",
          "I walked through here for about an our one day. Not so much in terms of explanation, but interesting. I didnt have a guide and that would have been helpful.",
          "This is a history of Ethiopia that everyone needs to learn about, very dark and disturbing. Very enlightening and the guide was very generous with the facts and tidbits about the whole period. Definitely a must visit.",
          "A small but powerful display, through photo and artifacts, of the 1970s and 1980s in Ethiopia, when mass murder was perpetuated my the military leaders.",
          "Very interesting and moving museum about a difficult period in Ethiopian history. Would be nice if there are guides but I did have a local Ethiopian friend who was able to give me some of the relevant history. Done tastefully but did not hold back on the graphic nature of the",
          "The place tells the Ethiopian history in the best narration possible. It sad that over half a million people had to lose their lives when the then incumbent regime that took over after the coupe was in place. I learnt that many of the perpetrators are living it large in Ethiopia",
          "This is not your average museum. It will only take about an hour to work through in entirety but the material is heavy going and a very up front look at the terrible genocide that occurred in Ethiopia. Really confronting but all the same I am glad that I went and reviewed the",
          "The sober building tells a haunting part of Ethiopian history that is not very known in the west. The communist regime that took place after the coup against emperor Haile Selassie killed half a million people in the country.",
          "The exhibits were good but they could have done a much better presentation. Sequencing the events with timelines would have helped visitors who didn't know the country's history (like me) to understand better. Inspite of having good artifacts they didn't do justice to the",
          "Not easy to take (terror rarely is), but a well done exhibition on one of the most difficult periods of time in Ethiopia's history. Terror is terror, and seeing the facing of those who died trying to stand up against a despotic regime will give you a look into the turmoil of",
          "simply you can see this place if you are visit Addis Ababa (Ethiopia)......you can see there past, present and future...",
          "This is the best place to visit in Addis to know the indepth reality of cruelty faced by the people of Ethopia.",
          "Was very hot but really enjoyed trip here .locals are very friendly and helpful. Offer very strong and sweet but we'll worth a visit. Took a taxi there easy to find.",
          "After coming out of this small meusum u have this feeling of sad for so many lives which were wasted in this Genocide A sad but interesting era to know Its free of charge Takes around 40 minutes with the commentary",
          "It was a sad place that made me feel sick, but an excellent reminder of what happened during the Red Terror.",
          "This is a typical holocaust museum.....the atrocities are well documented, the guide is a survivor....there are poignant reminders \"never again\" that are good. Unfortunately, too many countries and races have had to go through this. Yes, this museum needs to exist and",
          "It's free and that's the best part. They ask for a donation and I felt obliged to give them something more out of pity than anything else. The most powerful display was the remains unearthed from a mass grave. Otherwise, most of it seemed like random things that didn't seem to",
          "Hi I have visited the National Museum, the church at the top of the hill and last week the Rwanda genocide memorial and I can say out of this list this Red Terror museum and especially with the commentary of a surviver was top notch, by far the best. You need about 1 hour as it",
          "This small museum is a must stop in Addis. It presents a gripping description of the time under the Derg. No admission fee, but donations encouraged.",
          "Good presentation of history that most of us in the West don't know about. Took us about 90 minutes and we felt we had covered it well.",
          "This is a small museum dedicated to the memory of a difficult time in Ethiopia's history. Staffed by survivors of that era, it is impossible not to be moved after seeing its exhibit.",
          "not everybody's idea of a tourist stop but if you want to understand the struggle that many people in Ethiopia have made you need to see this. all periods in history where man exhibits his extraordinary ability to inflict pain and suffering on his fellow man, this chapter should",
          "My family and I learned a lot from this visit. I am from that time and have witnessed first hand what occurred during those days. Our guide was soo knowledgeable.",
          "This is a museum of events that went largely unreported in the west. The guides are some of the survivors and tell openly about the horror of living in a time of genocide. All within living memory. See the palaces and the museums but don't miss this.",
          "The Red Terror Martyr's Memorial Museum is a mercifully small one. It's compact and to the point on the horrors of the Durge regime, especially the plain dictats which sent so many people to their deaths. The museum is not for the squeamish; the bones of some of the victims",
          "This is a museum that one must visit when they are in Addis Ababa. The museum covers an important point in the history of Ethiopia.",
          "A very interesting museum about a difficult period in Ethiopia's history. The exhibits are extremely interesting. Be prepared to come away from the museum feeling quite sad.",
          "A very small but very insightful museum. It is free, overwhelming, in seeing what humans can do to other humans- in their own country! Thankfully the Derg were defeated and the wonderful people of Ethiopia can live in peace in their very beautiful country.",
          "This museum is well set out and provides a good explaination of the horrific things that occured during the derg regime. A worthwhile visit. My criticism would be that it does not explain much about how the derg was defeated.",
          "Our visit to the Red Terror Martyrs Museum was an eye opener. As an Aussie I had heard all about the atrocities of Pol Pot in Cambodia. For this dark chapter in Ethiopia's history to happen around the same time is testament to man's inhumanity to man not being an isolated",
          "I only had just over a day free in Addis Ababa after a few days spent in the countryside for work. This was one of around 4 things that I was able to see that day, and I have absolutely no regrets. To react to a recent reviewer: yes, it's small, and yes, the information provided",
          "This small museum is essential for a look into the horrors of Ethiopia's Derg regime (1974-1991). It includes historical timelines, photos and articles; walls of pictures of the deceased or disappeared; instruments of torture used by the government; a collection of skulls and",
          "This memorial is not really a museum. It is a shrine of photographs of those who were massacred. Entry is free or by donation and there are friendly staff willing to narrative the series of events related to the Red Terror. The English signs explaining the happenings could be",
          "Very nicely made about a difficult subject and time. It didn't take very long to see, but it was filled with information and gave us a lot of impressions.",
          "This is a place you should visit.we had a very good guide who took us through the history of Ethiopia. They really have come from far. My heart went out to those who lost their loved ones.",
          "This very personal and intimate museum is a must for anyone visiting Addis. The review of the history and brutality of the Derg is well done in clear visuals and short texts, and you can get a personal escort from someone who had suffered under the Derg for extra insight and",
          "This Museum is a very sobering experience. It was good to pause and remember Ethiopia's past and the sacrifices made by so many. We walked in and sort of wandered through on our own. We weren't sure where to start, but another group had a tour guide, so we tried to stay close",
          "Highly recommend supporting this local museum. Has very powerful images, art and remnants from the horrific Dergue regime in Ethiopia.",
          "The Red Terror Martyrs museum commemorates a particularly brutal period in Ethiopia's history. While the displays are didactic, the art and display cases carry a lot of passion and well worth seeing.",
          "Small and well worth the time to visit and talk to the docents...some of whom lived through this period",
          "Mr Fre was very kind to guide is through the dark history of Ethiopia which was kept away from the public. A must visit for everyone; place with very rich history",
          "Spent about an hour in here after a two week tour around the north of the country and it was well worth it - as it put parts of the bloody history of this beautiful country in context.",
          "A memorial to those who were killed by the Derg. It is a sad reminder to the dark history that we as human beings have. Quite graphic and words are not enough to express the sorrow that one feels. The museum contains detailed and graphical accounts of what happened in the wake",
          "Get a guide and dedicate time to this museum at the beginning of your time in Addis/Ethiopia. It is a confronting experience, and critically important to gaining perspective that will colour other experiences you have in the country. Ethiopia's ancient and modern history are",
          "Interesting and important. A little bit onesided, where I missed a perspective of other sides of The period. And there is space for improvement of The exibition as such. But again ;important to see",
          "A small museum that tells you a loy about what was the brief socialist path of Ethiopia under the rules of the Derg. Scary.",
          "A small, but very powerful, museum. Such a sad chapter in the long history of Ethiopia. To think that so many thousands of intellectuals and ordinary citizens were so ruthlessly killed by Mengistu... Sadly, it still takes place in other regions of Africa.",
          "This private museum is a must in your visit in AddisAbaba! You have to speak with the man wich is there and let him tell u a very sad and interesting story about his history. The museum is about the victims of a communist regim and to see a big and strong man weeping when tells",
          "A very informative and sobering museum, which left a deep impression of an important period in Ethiopian history. We recommend you visit so you can understand this period more.",
          "I have been there two weeks before . It Is wonderful , The tour in this museum left me with brief knowledge about what was happened in the Derge regime . The guides are really amazing.I recommend everybody to see this place .",
          "I have to embarrassingly admit that I was very unfamiliar with the political history of Ethiopia prior to going to this museum. Similarly to many Holocaust museums, as well as the Apartheid Museum and Constitution Hill in South Africa, this museum does a wonderful job of mixing",
          "One of the most bona fide museum I've seen in Ethiopia. Professionally and diligently prepared exhibition shows tragic history of the country under rules of military junta of Mengistu. Museum is small, but you will get huge dose of information (from descriptions and well",
          "This museum provides a great display of the suffering of the Ethiopian people under the military regime post Haile Selassie. It is very moving, and is a must to experience while in Addis.",
          "A very moving place, much like Vad Yesham in Jerusalem. If you wish to know more about more modern Ethiopian history you must go there. My guide was a victim of the regime - a lovely gentleman who told the story with no bitterness in his voice - just wanting the world to know",
          "Stumbled across this place one day with nothing much to do. I was with a bunch of people who lived in Addis and had never been themselves. We were all impressed. Helpful, passionate and informative staff. Really interesting insight into Ethiopia's fairly recent history that I",
          "These were the words spoken by the mother, whose four teenage children were all killed on the same day by the Derg, who officially opened the small but powerful \u2018Red Terror\u2019 Martyrs Memorial Museum in 2010. Over the space of a couple of rooms the museum reveals the fall of",

          "To start I was welcomed by one of the staff who was passionate about getting the information across. Great start. The displays were moving and informative. Nothing shocks you into understanding like a room of bones right after the photos of those killed. Instantly you wonder",
          "Had no idea this happened in Ethiopia so recently...walking through this free museum reminded us of our visits to the Killing Fields in Cambodia. A must see to get the full understanding of recent Ethopian history (sad as it is).",
          "The Red Terror museum is a must-see during a visit to Addis Ababa. I had an excellent guide, himself a survivor of Mengistu's red terror, and it was incredibly interesting and emotional to listen to his first hand account of the terrible regime. Entrance is free but a voluntary",
          "Entrance is free \u2013 donation to the museum and guide if you choose to have one is appreciated and I\u2019d suggest highly worthwhile. There are a number of guides for this museum who seem to take it in turns. Our guide has been imprisoned for 8 years under the Derg. A guide really",
          "Very moving, a couple of rooms with pictures and names of some killed under Derg and also cabinets filled with human remains, clothes...decisively not for kids....",
          "It is a relatively small museum that can be visited in an hour, but that will give you an insight of what happened during the terrible DERG years in Ethiopia. A very emotional experience, particularly because the guides are themselves victims of that cruel regime. Our guide had",
          "We visited on our last day in Ethiopia. We were very glad to have gone to learn from a first hand account from the museum guide about the experience during the Red Terror. It was a very worthwhile experience.",
          "Very well kept and displayed (for Addis Abeba standards) part of the history of Ethiopia. Be aware: you won't leave the building happy.",
          "This is a memorial and museum that tells the story of an atrocity with which you may not be familiar, the Red Terror inflicted by Ethiopia's Derg military regime in the 1970's and 80's. The guides are all survivors of arrest, torture, and other forms of oppression under the",
          "We found this small museum detailing the suffering and terrible loss of life during the dark days of military regime all bit depressing.",
          "Interesting insight into the current governments sacrifice. It also has a little nice library inside.",
          "This museum is located on Bole Road near to the Big Meskel Square.It is nuilt in memory of the lives lost during the nasty military regime of Mengistu Hailemariam who savagely murdered so many innocent persons.It was a sad moment for the country where thousands were butchered",
          "The museum serves as a memorial to the collective memory of the one of the darkest day in Ethiopia. The tour guides are excellent providing first-hand accounts of this period. Highly recommended.",
          "Small and sparesely labelled. A nice attempt just needs more explanitory plaques and more of a rhythm to the exhibits.",
          "Great museum telling you about a short but unpleasant part of Ethiopia's history. A number of personal artefacts and some excellent photos make the visit very moving. A must see",
          "I didn't get a personal tour as many have described and I didn't find the museum very interesting or informative at all. Just read about the history on wikipedia.",
          "I love history...This place offers insight into Ethiopian History like you have never heard before.The pictures,the props,the guides narration,the mini cemetery.Its not gorry scary,it is a sad place with sad tales.You will leave heavy hearted but I believe all should visit.You",
          "This is a scary museum about the communist terror in Ethiopia. It is made like the killing fields museum in Phnom Penh.",
          "Entrance is by donation - guides don't expect a tip but please do! This was the best tourist spot so far in Addis, only matched by the Entoto Church. Our guide had personally endured several years in prison during the Red Terror. This dark history of Ethiopia puts the present",
          "Highly recommend this museum. Take advantage of the guide. The education we received about this important piece of history was so much more than if we had gone through ourselves. There is no entry fee but after an hour with a very knowledgeable guide who suffered first-hand",
          "Our guide inside the museum was an elderly gentleman who personally lived through some of the terrors so his narration was all the more meaningful. Takes about 45-60 mins but it is fascinating. The artifacts and photographs tell a powerful story.",
          "Allow yourself plenty of time to fully appreciate this terrible part of Ethiopia's history. Free entry and easy to find",
          "All Ethiopians are friendly.. there I said it.. The trip to the museum one evening made me appreciate and be grateful. The caretaker of the museum a retired army officer spoke more on the events that took place... It's true pictures speak a thousand words. . There is need",

          "It's a dark tourism site- a story of blood, gore, torture- brothers against brothers. But what haunts and rips your heart is that the people guiding you are the survivors of an era of bloodshed. He stands next to you and talks about his torture, their families, their torturers",
          "We loved this museum! We both knew nothing about the Derg so wanted to learn more about this part of Ethiopian history and we did! The free (well, by donation) guided tour is an absolute much. Touching and informative. Excellent.",

        "wiki": "Holy Trinity Cathedral, known in Amharic as Kidist Selassie, is the highest ranking Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo cathedral in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It was built to commemorate Ethiopia's liberation from Italian occupation and is the second most important place of worship in Ethiopia, after the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum.\n\n\n== Title ==\nThe cathedral bears the title 'Menbere Tsebaot', or 'Pure Altar'.  The church compound is the burial place for those who fought against the Italian Occupation, or those who accompanied the Emperor into exile from 1936 to 1941. The Emperor Haile Selassie and his consort the Empress Menen Asfaw are buried in the north transept of the cathedral. Other members of the Imperial Family are buried in the crypt below the church.  The High Altar of the cathedral is dedicated to 'Agaiste Alem Kidist Selassie' (Sovereigns of the World the Holy Trinity).  The other two altars in the Holy of Holies on either side of the High Altar are dedicated to St. John the Baptist and to 'Kidane Meheret' (Our Lady Covenant of Mercy).  In the south transept of the cathedral is a recently added chapel of St. Michael, which houses the Tabot or Ark of St. Michael the Archangel, which was returned to Ethiopia in February 2002 after being discovered in Edinburgh.  This relic was taken by British forces from the mountain citadel of Magdalla in 1868 during their campaign against Emperor Tewodros II.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe cathedral complex also includes the 'Bale Wold' (Feast of God the Son) Church, which is also known as the Church of the Four Heavenly Creatures.  This church served as the original Holy Trinity Monastery Church before the building of the Cathedral and dates back to the reign of Emperor Menelik II.  Other facilities include a primary and a secondary school, a monastery and the Holy Trinity Theological College, a museum and monuments housing the remains of those massacred in Addis Ababa by the Italians in 1937 in response to an assassination attempt against the Fascist Viceroy of Italian East Africa.  In addition is the monument and tomb of the officials of the imperial government who were executed by the Communist Derg regime. Holy Trinity Cathedral is the official seat of the Orthodox Archdiocese of Addis Ababa.  The Patriarchs of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church are enthroned at Holy Trinity Cathedral and all Bishops are consecrated there as well.\n\n\n== Imperial tombs ==\nThe tombs of the Emperor Haile Selassie and Empress Menen Asfaw, as well as other members of the Imperial Family, are inside Holy Trinity Cathedral. Patriarchs, Abune Tekle Haimanot and Abune Paulos of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, are buried in the churchyard, as is the famous British suffragette and anti-fascist activist Sylvia Pankhurst. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and other prominent Ethiopians are also buried there.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Holy Trinity Cathedral, Addis Ababa at Wikimedia Commons\n\nHoly Trinity Cathedral at www.sacred-destinations.com",

          "worth seeing this type of cathedral, an interesting contrast to the traditional churches arond the contry one sees as a tourist. Also interesting to see the tomb of Slyvia Pankhurst (and her son, Richard) outside",
          "The Holy Trinity Cathedral was an interesting place to visit, learn more about the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and see the tombs of Emperor Haile Selassie and Empress Menen Asfaw.",
          "Beautiful church and the burial place of Haile Selassie. The grounds are interesting with a Haile Selassie museum, a memorial to victims of the Communist Derg and a group of monuments to Ethiopian heroes.",
          "The cathedral was built on an historical site of the capital\u2019s development and is well preserved. Usual courtesy of shoes off at door but you were allowed to take photos respectfully inside the cathedral. Saturday morning was a great time to visit as no one around or service in",
          "At 200 of the local currency, with its \"hit the tourists with much higher chargers\" this cathedral is worth seeing once for the church, a small museum of religious artifacts, and some interesting graveyards. Shame on the practice of fleecing non-natives just to see a church.",
          "While not a large church by western standards it certainly does not lack character and should be visited. The stained glass is beautiful. There are both the traditional bible scenes and modern glass. Be sure to visit the cemetery and see the incredible monuments.",
          "The church was the beat we have been in the morning and the guide the people there was the best. we should see this place if you go to Ethiopia",
          "The church looks pretty nice from the outside, and I was really hoping to go in, but unfortunately this was the absolute end of my trip and I didn't have the 200 birr in cash that they (surprisingly, to me) require for admission. (roughly $6). It wasn't that it was too",
          "Itinerary This is a typical itinerary for this product Pass By: Meyazia 27 Square Monument, Addis Ababa Ethiopia Myazia 27 Square Monument or Dillachin ( Victory Monument ) The historic monument depicts a Lion of Judah and a circle of relief figures and monumental panels",

          "The church was tucked away down a park- like setting. It looks old, so therefore interesting to us. We didn\u2019t ho inside, but saw it from outside...",
          "Trinity Cathedral is a must for Addis visitors. As well as being the burial place for the Patriots who fought for Ethiopia\u2019s liberation from the Italians it also has a small but very moving mausoleum to the leaders killed following the downfall of the Emperor in the grounds.",
          "We had heard a lot about this cathedral and its stained windows. However, it was disappointing to find that the gatekeepers (or so they seemed) were hawks at the entrance, waiting to feed on the tourists. There was no signage about an entry fee but they insisted on 200 Birr per",
          "Spent a hour inside and around the church. It is interesting and not the typical church in Ethiopia.",

          "We visited this church early morning and because it was Sunday, the crowd was unbelievable. Built by the former president of Ethiopia Haile Selassie, where his body and his wife\u2019s body are kept there. Huge building with many pictures on the walls. Many tombs all around the",
          "With a guide to explain the historical and Orthodox context this was a very interesting visit. The explanation of the length of the services, the use of the resting sticks, separate entrances for men and women who occupy separate sides of the church, the tomb of Haile Selassie",
          "I visited it in the afternoon on a bright sunny day and the architecture and wall art are great. Only took 20 mins to walk round.",
          "Nice stained glass windows and a gentle introduction to the Ethiopian Coptic church religion. Photography is allowed. Interesting statues in the garden.",
          "But then there is not that much to see in Addis Ababa anyway. Only went because i had spare time on my hands",
          "This is a modern Orthodox Cathedral which is quite different to all others in the country. The former Emperor clearly intended it as a monument to himself and his ostentatious coffin attests to that. We had a bit of time to spare but if you are on a tight schedule don\u2019t bother.",
          "A historical and a most significant cathedral of the Ethiopian Orthodox church in Addis Ababa. It is well worth the visit and a quiet place amid the chaotic city.",

          "There is so much to see here. The tomb of Hailee Salassie, the beautiful stained glass, the Pankhurst memorial.... I could go on. Entrance is 200 Bir and you can also pay on of the local guides to take you round, which is definitely worth it. Its not a particularly old",
          "Unusual architecture, nice museum, tombs of Haile Selassie and his wife, Miruts Yifter, Sylvia Pankhurst",
          "I went there. I saw it. I don't need to go back again. The stained glass windows are lovely. The graveyards are rather ramshackle.",
          "Beautiful Catherdral with stained glass windows and the tombs of Emperor Haile Selassie and his wife. There is also a graveyard on the grounds and the second oldest Ethiopian church. There is also a museum of Ethiopian Orthodox history which was closed for lunch when I visited.",
          "This was a stop on our day tour of the city. It's spectacular inside with all the decorations and religious paraphernalia one expects in a large church. No problem taking pictures but you have to take your shoes off. Dont miss the nearby cemetery. There are Ethiopian Orthodox",
          "Churches in Ethiopia are very different to other countries and this is typical. Austere and imposing but not ostentatious.",
          "This cathedral was built by Haile Selassie and is interesting to visit. We hired a guide to make it more informative. I recommend a guide. The only church I have visited so far, that requires you to remove your shoes. We will be visiting other cities in Ethiopia so perhaps it",
          "This Church which was built by the late and deposed Emperor Haile Selassie is the main orthodox shrine in Addis Abeba. Its most distinguished part is the stained glass done by Belgian craftsmen which are very beautiful. In front of the church, one can find tombs and graves of",

          "This cathedral is a big box of Art, master in architecture and memorable atmosphere. i was not able to go in because the cathedral was close but i experienced a nice sunset around. the dome and tower of the building are amazing",
          "The emperor's mausoleum must be seen. The most important church in Ethiopia. But relatively new compared to Lalibela.",
          "This hillside cathedral is surrounded by a cemetery in which many famous politicians, artists, and writers of Ethiopia are buried. There is a daily mass and extremely devout Ethiopian Orthodox Christians outside and within this cathedral. There are lovely stained glass windows",
          "Our guide at Holy Trinity demonstrated a deep understanding of the Ethiopian Orthodox faith in addition to the church itself. More than this, he was able to reflect, comparatively, on the Ethiopian Orthodoxy and Other forms of Christianity. From faith to dogma to Christian",
          "Good start for religious education on the Ethiopian Orthodox church. Large and many amazing paintings.",
          "This is all the books say it is. Ehat was most inspiring though was the respect the locals showed to everything this building represents. From small children to old folk bowed, made the cross and kissed the outside wsll. Some were just sitting quietly and clearly meditating",

          "The new church, from the time of Haile Selassie. The emperor's mausoleum must be seen. Interesting cemetery with the mausoleum of Meles Zenawi.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The monument to the Lion of Judah is a statue of the Lion of Judah, symbol of Ethiopian Emperors and Ethiopia is located in Addis Ababa.\n\n\n== History of the monument ==\n\nThe monument is located in the square of the Addis Ababa railway station in Addis Ababa and marks the end of Winston Churchill Avenue, one of the main arteries of the city.\nThe sculpture of the Lion of Judah, in gilded bronze, is placed on a black granite pedestal decorated with relief portraits of Menelik II, Haile Selassie I, Zewditu, and ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael.\nThe work was made by the French sculptor Georges Gardet in 1930, on the occasion of the coronation of Emperor Hail\u00e9 Selassi\u00e9 on November 2,1930.\nAfter the 1974 revolution, the Derg regime thought of removing the monument, symbol of the monarchy, but an association of Arbegnoch veterans claimed that it was a memory of Ethiopian antifascist resistance and a symbol of Ethiopia. So, the regime agreed to leave the monument, which is still in front of the Addis Ababa central station.\nIn 1954 a new monument was commissioned by Emperor Hail\u00e8 Selassi\u00e8 from sculptor Maurice Calka.\n\n\n== The monument brought to Rome ==\n\nAt the end of the so-called March of the Iron Will (in italian: Marcia della ferrea volont\u00e0) (during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War) that led to the occupation of Addis Ababa by the Italian army, the statue was transported to Rome, Italy in 1935 at the end of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War.\nThe Lion of Judah sculpture was placed just beyond Square of Five hundred to Rome, under the obelisk that remembers of the Battle of Dogali on May 8, 1937, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the proclamation of the Italian Empire.\nThe Lion of Judah statue remained in Rome until the 1960s, when it was returned to Ethiopia after the negotiations in Addis Ababa. Emperor Haile Selassie took part in the new inauguration ceremony in military uniform, also recalling the patriotic gesture of Zerai Derres.\n\n\n== Zerai Derres history in Italy ==\nOn June 15, 1938 the young Eritrean Zerai Deres made a protest against the Italian occupation of Ethiopia in front of the monument. Brandishing a scimitar, he wounded several onlookers and was shot by soldiers. He was arrested by the fascist militia and imprisoned in a psychiatric hospital (however, contemporary Italian historians doubt the claim that he was mentally unstable) in Sicily, where he died in 1945.

It reaches 3,200 meters above sea level.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIt is a historical place where Emperor Menelik II resided and built his palace, when he came from Ankober and founded Addis Ababa. It is considered a sacred mountain and has many monasteries. Mount Entoto is also the location of a number of celebrated churches, including Saint Raguel and Saint Mary.The mountain is densely covered by eucalyptus trees that were imported from Australia during the reign of Menelik II, and mostly planted during Emperor Haile Selassie's reign. Thus, it is sometimes referred to as the \"lung of Addis Ababa\". The forest on the mountain is an important source of firewood for the city. It was also a source of building material in earlier times. \nThe Ethiopian Heritage Trust, a non-profit, non-governmental organization, is working actively to change part of the mountain to its old state, a natural park. Entoto Natural Park is the northeastern rim of Addis Abeba, on the southeastern slopes of Mt. Entoto, covering an area of 1,300 hectares. It is situated at an altitude of between 2,600 and 3,100 meters. Its annual average rainfall and temperature are 1200 mm and 14\u00b0C, respectively. The northern rim of the park serves as a watershed between the Abay (Blue Nile) and Awash rivers.\nThe Ethiopian Space Science Society has an observatory on the 3,200 m summit.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Very beautiful church. The church was built by Menelik II when he moved the capital to Addis Ababa. Next to it are his palace. This emperor was a humble man, who had a simple palace. He is the founder of modern Ethiopia as an unified kingdom. Check the museum next. I",
          "Colourful exterior but not much else to see here. If you're in the area it's worth passing by to take a photo and walk around.",
          "We had a guide take us up the hill to the church. There is a small museum, which is somewhat interesting, but a bit depressing seeing how such historical items are displayed. It is a local church, and we weren't able to go inside, but could walk around it. It is an important",
          "It is nice as a tourist to go to a place that is mainly for locals. Even the museum palace behind is definitely worth seeing but it is best to go with a guide to explain what you are seeing",

          "We enjoyed our two hour or so wondering around the colourful wooden church. In small anti rooms dotted around we could hear the priest (?) chanting loudly, screaming and other odd noises from the 10 or so people crowded into the small rooms. Not sure what was going on & it",
          "A very nice excursion to the top of Addis, Entoto Hill. The museum nearby presents a good overview of Ethiopian religious artefacts and some historic documents. The surrounding is ideal to observe local way of life, so different from the urban crowds. Menelik`s palace is also",
          "If you're heading further north to Axum/Lalibela etc it's worth kicking off at Entoto Maryam, which is just a short ride out of central Addis to help set the scene. There is interesting artwork inside the church and the surrounding biuldings have much historical context as the",
          "Not a huge wow-factor, but the drive up Entoto mountain, the views, and then this little bit of history make for a nice half-day outing.",

          "It was recommend a must see by our guide, Berachew We spoke to him and told us on which day the festive's are more likely to happen. He was very knowledgeable about the history of the church, and he gave us the breakdown on the artwork on its cultural and religious meaning. It",

          "I wouldnt say it was a excellent trip but it was ok. Although we never get to go inside the church, exploring the grounds was nice as it have old interesting architecture around the back of the grounds. Those buildings have a rich history that goes with them as well.",
          "On the grounds is a 700 yr old church carved out of the rock. By itself worth the visit. A small little museum that displays artifacts and old hand written bible in Amharic. Then the church - wow! Hand painted christian scenes in natural floral based dyes, Outstanding art in",
          "Our visit to the church was supposed to have been included with the visit to the museum and the emperor's palace, however we were not allowed into the church. I can't remark on the interior.",

          "The Entoto hill was the capital before moving to Addis Ababa . The church and Museum collections are mostly presented Menelik's coro\u00adnation and different instruments those were used at the battle of Adwa as well as royal robs are there totally it shows history of Ethiopia at the",
          "We enjoyed visiting but a lot of beggars so just be prepared for that. Over all it was good time, I did like seeing the Kings home and seeing how things were over 100 years ago. Also if you get a guide they are going to be asking for money when they are done showing you around.",
          "Quite a nice one, well kept and well known. Just a few km from town on top of Entoto montain. Close by you can have nice walks with stunning views, either over the large town or, opposite, on the North route.",
          "Entototo was the original capital. This church has a lot of exhibits inside. The government should provide better funding to protect these world treasures. This is a very site for the Ethiopians and I could feel the gravity of the place, too. A short walk away is the old humble",
          "I'm not quite sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't a church that looked like a paisley piece of fabric. Of course the colors are pretty, and it was built by King Menelik II in 1982 and is now a museum. There is much to be seen on Mt. Entoto and the Church is only one part",
          "Quite a way out of town but definitely worth it. Informative guided tour at both the small museum and the original residence. Wonderful views of Addis from the top of the road driving back to the city.",
          "I don't think it's worth driving to the top of the hill just to see this church; one can only view the exterior and there is nothing of note. The small museum is interesting for some of the artifacts from Menelik II's day including his crown and robes, and so the drive up there",
          "For me the best place to see in Addis, not only the Church, also the Place of Minilk. It is good to see and feel history and life style of country. With Church, please visit the place and museum. Also you can have best top view of Addis from this point. For your information,",

          "Our group took a tour of the Maryam Church where a guide gave a very interesting tour of the small, but historically significant building and grounds. Well worth the effort to learn about Ethiopia's history (and the pride Ethiopians take in their cultural heritage).",

          "You will really enjoy the drive up Mt. Entoto to St Mary's Church where you will see donkey's and hard working women carrying firewood down the mountain on route. The church grounds are wonderfully peaceful, and the church itself is a quaint rustic design with vibrant colours",
          "We never went inside the church, but we visited the museum and saw the old and new church from the outside and also the old palace of emperor Menelik II from both in- and outside. It was all very interesting, and the guide really knew his thing. When I was in the area almost",
          "The church building by itself is a good example of the way Ethiopian Orthodox churches used to be built. Most of the churches in Addis Ababa according to me are made look fancy and a bit over innovated . I have been to Entoto maryam church many times and what I do as trend is",
          "The drive up to the top of the mountain is beautiful. We were unable to visit the interior of the church but the visit to the museum associated with the church made the effort to get there worth the time. There were some very old bejeweled crowns and icons, well preserved robes,",

          "One needs to \"do\" one Orthodox church and since they are all structurally similar, the take away is driven by the quality of the guide and how it impacts one visually. This one has a great position up the hill which is a must do in itself and there are some decent guides to",
          "I didn't know this place existed before I came up Entoto Mountain so I was pleasantly surprised. I found it interesting to learn something about the past Emperor's of Ethiopia and see pictures of them. Ethiopia has preserved its history for future generations. Well done!",
          "We went up to Sheromeda or there about with a bus and then walked all the way up. There are a lot of vendors outside of the walls of the church. Inside the ground there is a little museum which is interesting and the guides speak various languages. The church was close so I did",
          "At first I was a little shocked when the guide stated that we would be paying 100 birr to go into a museum I didn't really know existed, but what you get for your money is a very informative exhibition about past Ethiopian emperors. For my group of west London teenagers, most",

        "wiki": "Meskel (Ge'ez: \u1218\u1235\u1240\u120d, m\u00e4sq\u00e4l) is an annual religious holiday in the Ethiopian Orthodox and Eritrean Orthodox churches, which commemorates the discovery of the True Cross by the Roman Empress Helena (Saint Helena) in the fourth century. Meskel occurs on the 17 Meskerem in the Ethiopian calendar (September 27, Gregorian calendar, or on 28 September in leap years). \"Meskel\" (or \"Meskal\" or \"Mesqel\", there are various ways to transliterate from Ge'ez to Latin script) is Ge'ez for \"cross\".\nThe festival is known as Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in other Orthodox, Catholic or Protestant churches. The churches that follow the Gregorian calendar celebrate the feast yearly on September 14.\nThe feast is held in Meskel Square, named after the festival, in the capital city of Addis Ababa. Religious and civil leaders preside over the celebration, and public figures give speeches and reference biblical themes and stories. Many Ethiopians who live in cities return to their villages to celebrate the national event. When it gets darker, the Demera is burned.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe Meskel celebration includes the burning of a large bonfire, or Demera, based on the belief that Queen Eleni, as she is known, had a revelation in a dream. She was told that she should make a bonfire and that the smoke would show her where the True Cross was buried. So she ordered the people of Jerusalem to bring wood and make a huge pile. After adding frankincense to it the bonfire was lit and the smoke rose high up to the sky and returned to the ground, exactly to the spot where the Cross had been buried.According to local traditions, this Demera-procession takes place in the early evening the day before Meskel or on the day itself.  The firewood is decorated with daisies prior to the celebration. Charcoal from the remains of the fire is afterwards collected and used by the faithful to mark their foreheads with the shape of a cross (compare Ash Wednesday). Edward Ullendorff records a number of beliefs of the meaning of Demera, with some believing that it \"marks the ultimate act in the cancellation of sins, while others hold that the direction of the smoke and the final collapse of the heap indicate the course of future events \u2013 just as the cloud of smoke the Lord raised over the Tabernacle offered guidance to the children of Israel (Exod. 40:34\u201338).\"\n\nOne explanation for the high rank this festival has in the church calendar is that it is believed that a part of the true Cross has been brought to Ethiopia from Egypt. It is said to be kept at Amba Geshen, which itself has a cross-shaped plan.According to the Ethiopian  Orthodox Church, the discovery of the True Cross is traditionally believed to have been in March, but Meskel was moved to September to avoid holding a festival during Lent, and because the church commemorating the True Cross in Jerusalem was dedicated during September. Ullendorff speculates that Meskel replaced an older festival, with pagan and Hebraic associations, which he believes received its Christian sanction around the reign of Emperor Amda Seyon in the fourteenth century. \"The most ancient meaning of these feasts \u2013 as was also the case in Israel \u2013 was no doubt seasonal: the month of Maskaram marked the end of the rains, the resumption of work, and the reopening of communications.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nUllendorff, Edward (1968) Ethiopia and the Bible,  Schweich lectures series, Oxford University Press for the British Academy, ISBN 0-19-726076-4\n\n\n== External links ==\nFestival and Holidays on the website of the Embassy of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in the United Kingdom, with a section on \"Meskel - The Finding of the True Cross\"",

          "It's been in much worse condition before but now the animals are in much better condition however animals are confined to a very small space and specially to see the Lions its saddening they deserve better they are majestic animals they need space. Most of them were not there i",
          "Even though the zoo carries endemic animals such as the Gelada Baboon and Black Maned Lion, they are kept in unbelievably small cages with poor hygiene.The animals are in such sad emotional states its depressing to watch. Birds are kept in small cages away from any habitat like",
          "this mini is on ita way to renovation and the management they said has plans to make it bigger. animals wise, they all look healthy and well feed I dont see any wrong in parks like this as it will serve as place to learn, appreciate and respect animals, of course you cannot",
          "Sad to see those poor lions caged in a very small room in the middle of the city. Also some other caged animals like baboons and other types of monkeys. One can see how in poor condition they are handled. Please do not go there",
          "Addis Ababa Zoo Park Center is currently renovating and expanding their facilities to include \"a playground, animal sculptures, a picnic area, reading and sitting areas, an aquarium and an aviary. Upon completion, it will house 12 species of wildlife including lions, Gelada",
          "Haha, what a foolery. This place is closed! Our taxi driver told us the caretaker got eaten by the lions, so they had to shoot them after a life in captivity, how animal friendly really, so since end 2016 there is this Muslim Exposition taking place instead.",
          "this lions as i heard from the guide unique to the world available only in ethiopia good to visit they say it is black lion but the place isn't that much of a zoo i think it is old zoo",
          "No information about the closure on the internet, hence this would be the second best place to post about it. Hope they will find the lions back sooner than later to reopen the place.",
          "This place has been around for a long time, it brings back lots of memories and it's no wonder why. What better way to experience wildlife, particularly lions when you are in the middle of a busy city. It's such a great place to go to visit all the beautiful lions and lionesses,",
          "If you are interested of animals this is a place to see the Ethopian Black Maned Lion. The Zoo is not very nice as a place for the animals but it is nice to see these beautiful animals!",
          "The Lion park of Addis is the only lively lion home and one can see those lions and lioness in a single Lion Zoo at Sidist Kilo .Those who are interested in Safari tours can visit this Zoo by near distance. Not only the lions there but also there are some other fauna species",
          "Bummer, it's closed for remodeling or maintenance until April, I am told. I do hope this will bring larger environments than I hear they have but I'm so disappointed I won't get to go.",
          "Close this place down! You can see the distress in these beautiful animals kept in small cages for the amusement of locals. Anyone who enjoys this kind of attraction should be ashamed of themselves.",
          "This place has several lions in captivity. Sad for the lions. But, got to see the African lion...huge mane and all. Much much bigger than Asian lions. Visited in 2016. Was closed in Jan 2017 for renovation. Will open in April - May 2017 they said.",
          "These Abyssinian lions have darker manes and their body size is also said to be different (i.e. smaller). There are also other animals in the zoo including kudu, tortoise... I recommend this zoo for those interested in details e,g, the unique features of the Abyssinian lions.",
          "If you like to see a black lion, this is the place. Very accessible. Do not forget to get av fresh fruit drink outside the gate. There you can also get an etiopian daily paper to read",
          "it is not fun to visit the zoo at all. the lion's don't have enough space to properly move. They look like they are going crazy. They should close this facility and put the lion's in a better environment",
          "Place is ok. There is a nominal entry fee and then you can see 5 or 6 caged lion sleeping all the time. I actually dont like to see animals caged so i didn't liked this place that much.",
          "It was an awesome and a great feeling being so close to royalty. Strongly recommend this activity. Only wish I could pet one of them. Lol.",
          "I happened to be downtown walking about with an Ethiopian friend and saw this and asked about it so he suggested we walk through. We were maybe there 30 minutes and that was only because it was very crowded- it was a weekend and filled with local Ethiopians. This seems to be",
          "this is a very small zoo, there are a few lions, birds monkeys and so on. the lions looked stressed and out of order",
          "This zoo is the only Animal zoo found in Addis Ababa, which is small. In Animal Zoo it can be like a big zoo, animal safety, food and drink and children play ground but also adults spar time should be there. carnival and music entertainment can be here in abroad way. finally the",
          "This type of lion are very unique in their color and sizes. they are very big and fairly reddish in color. The only problem is that most if not all of the lions in that zoo are very old. there is need for having new generation of the same species. If you go round there also",
          "I don't think the animals in this zoo get proper care. It is small place and don't have many animals. If you want to see real Ethiopian lion, you might have to go to safari outside Addis Ababa",
          "Excellent value (low ticket price) go at feeding time for more fun. Kids will love it a definite \"must see\" place",
          "The zoo is very old and poorly maintained. There are only a few animals on display, and they are not presented well. The good news is that the city is building a new and modern zoo which will open soon.",
          "I've been to Addis Ababa many times but never went to the zoo! It's very small and we were done viewing must of the wildlife in about 35 minutes!",
          "Ethiopian lions are rare, they have black manes, and the lion zoo had several. The cages however are old style with heavy bars and little for the animals to do. There also were baboons and an Ibis. The manual dexterity of the baboons is amazing and they proved very",
          "The Lion Zoo is an okay place to visit if you're traveling with kids. There are several lions to look at, however it is a rather sad place, especially if you are an animal lover. The animals look fairly well fed, but they are behind bars like a zoo from a 1950's cartoon. $5",
          "I was excited to get to see some lions, but it was very unfortunate under the circumstances. The living conditions just don't seem right to me. They should be put in a larger space with more room to run and be a wild animal.",
          "This place is good for kids and families who would like to visit a Zoo. There are animals to be seen. Especially Lions. There are also foods available around it.",
          "Other than being at the midst of the city Addis, this zoo is very ill maintained place with almost nothing other than Lions!",
          "There are number of lions in the zoo.Small cubs are also there.Lot of repair works and maintenance is required.Not very well managed.Probably can give it on lease to a private company to improve the zoo professionally and hygenic and nice to protect to the king of the jungle",
          "animals should feel comfortable otherwise should be left free. it saddens me to see animals in cages. it is definitely not the best zoo i have seen.",
          "My friend and I were staying close to this place so decided we would have a look. To start with they have a local and foreigners price which was not expensive but strange. There are eight lions female and males in a round concrete building each with an extremely small amount",
          "A quite run down zoo, but interesting to see the last of the descendants from Hailli Selassie's lions. As there is a shortage of room they are not allowed to breed and it is a shame that such magnificent animals have to be kept in such small and stark cages.",
          "After or before visiting Ethnographic museum of Ethiopia at Sidist kilo you should have to check out lion zoo in front of Yekatit 12 Martyr's monument or hospital. Seriously I like them",

          "Average zoo. Not very well maintained, smelly. Be ware of pickpockets. Animals are in a pity state. Lions are magnificent, and they have two monkeys and two birds and an antelope. 20 Birr for foreigners is bit more for this zoo unless you really want to see a lion.",
          "its touch me to see lion so skinny and not getting enoght food medical care the only place i never viste in addis ababa",
          "Many years ago (about 7 years) it was good, but my recent experience wasn't that good. It was extremely crowded with very expensive ferenji tickets (foreigner tickets), the small lion cages show they haven't been cleaned in a while, the lions were asleep all the time (what else",
          "So sad to see the king of animals are treated like a street dog. Very pathetic upkeep and cleanliness, if can't maintain please allow them to be at their on tertiary.",
          "The Lions are big and magnificent, but the rest of the zoo is a little sad. Several of the animal cages appear to improvisations made of spare wood and chicken wire. Spots to see the lions clearly can get crowded during feeding time. If you have a car, I suggest going to see",
          "Took our three little ones to the Lion Zoo this morning after a trip up Mt. Entoto. As many shared, this is not the Sydney Zoo, so don't expect much. Hopefully, the animals have always been caged, so they do not know any better. Yes, tough living conditions, but we are in",
          "My dad used to take us to Lion zoo when we were kids.It was free entrance for kids and 50 cent for adults.The entrance fee must be changed by now.It is good to see the Lions.But they do not seem happy to be caged and stared by people around poor Lions.In addition",
          "This place has been the same for many years and hopefully they are building a new home for these amazing Abysinian lions. Other animals also spend there days locked in small inappropriate enclosures. It's a very sad place and the toilet facilities are some of the worst I've",
          "Honestly, it's one of the most horrible places I have ever seen. Not just for the few, poor animals (six 'former' lions, an antilope and little more) surviving there among their own excrements, but also for the non-existing state of maintenance of the area and many many other",
          "I say average as not a lover of Zoo's. Saying that it was 'better' than I thought it would be, all said and done the Lions are amazing even though their living conditions must be upgraded - looking forward to and fully support plans for new location and improved living",
          "The Lion zoo is in need of a lot of improvement, I understand that a new one is being built, and look forward to seeing this on a return trip to Addis, the lions are a must see not only because of their rare breed but also because of their history within the imperial households",
          "The zoo is not that big, and the main thing they sell to visitor here is the lion. somehow it's good to visit the zoo but if you only have short time in Addis Ababa better to visit another place which more attractive (but it is really depend on what exactly you interesting to).",
          "Don't go. The conditions in which the animals have to live are atrocious. The dik dik was friendly. The lions impressive. The baboon was very sad and alone.",
          "Just a very sad place to see lions. The grounds have been landscaped so if you want a place to see flowers, it is quite nice, but the lions and their cages are old and barren. I felt bad for the lions. Such magnificent creatures in such horrible spaces. There really isn't",
          "It was good but when we were paying to get in they looked at my mom and said shes American and she had to pay more than the rest of us. I guess that's because me my sister and my brother are African american and my dads Ethiopian. But other than that it was good",
          "recently I have been with my brother here in lion zoo. the price was cheap but not interesting for a tourist to visit in the zoo. these place is just for children of Ethiopian.",
          "Dingy cages, hardly any animals ; the place is completely run down and horribly maintained. Felt really sorry for the Animals. Would suggest this zoo should be shut down.",
          "Having been to San Diego zoo which in my opinion is the best in the world, visiting Addis Ababa zoo was a shock. All this has are a few deer, a few lions in ridiculously small enclosures, a heron, a duck and an eagle in a horribly tiny cage. The entire zoo can be completed in 5",
          "Approximately five male lions and two females are in relatively small cages in this small zoo. There are also a few monkeys and a few indigenous deer and tortoises lazing around. Foreign adults are 20 bir; foreign children are 10 bir. There is a 20 bir charge to carry a",
          "Coming from Europe and not being a Zoo Fan anyway, this was the most horrific thing, i have ever seen. Very! small and dirty cages, i was shocked. Felt so unbelievably sorry for those poor animales. I expected \"different\" standards, of course, but this simply broke my heart",
          "This has to be the worst Zoo ever. It is animal cruelty. Imagine a 3D hollow Pie. And section of this said pie has one, two or sometimes three Lions. Animals look well fed, but are ill treated by the visitors. There are some more cages with some assorted Monkeys, cranes, ducks",
          "All I can say about this \"attraction\" is that it is tiny and overpriced at best...and animal cruelty at worst. The lions were all crammed into small concrete cages, pacing back and forth as one would expect from a life spent locked behind bars. Many of them did not even have",
          "This isn't a big zoo. There are a few lion cages in the center of the park, and a few other animals also. I felt bad for the lions, because they don't have a lot of freedom, as they are locked up in the cages with very little space for them - very far from their natural habitat.",
          "This \"zoo\" is not much more than a series of cages for some very old big cats. Not worth the price of admission and certainly not worth the price to bring in a camera.",
          "We visited here on a Sunday and it was packed- so much so that I was quite nervous about how many people were milling around. The lions all looked so sad. The zoo would benefit from some renovation.",
          "6 Lions stuck in small cages, few other animals that will be happier in wildlife. Disappointed about this small zoo in the center of the polluted Addis.",
          "I have been told that the lions which you will see at Lion Zoo, are genetically different form any lion you can find in the world. There are 20 of them and they have been treated and kept by HIM Haile Silassie I. You will enjoy if you visit this place. It is only 4 mins walking",
          "We stopped by here on a whim between the local museums. Entrance is about 20 Birr (around a dollar) and the zoo itself is a bit on the tiny side. The best thing I can say here is that the title is an accurate description of the locale, but the overall experience was a bit",
          "Visited the zoo with my young daughter. it was great for her to visit the lions, but the conditions are very bad. People taunt the animals by throwing things at the cages. The animals exhibit many stress behaviors and seem is poor shape. Happy we got to see black maned lions,",
          "This is small zoo, and a typical Third World zoo. Not too clean, and the conditions in which the animals are kept are not too good.",
          "Would not recommend. There are many other places you can visit that will be worth your time and prevent the heartbreak of seeing these majestic beasts caged up. If you desire to see animals it's best to seek them out in their natural habitat... Not in the conditions they are",
          "A couple of old lions and some birds !! Hardly a zoo. It is all a bit hickldy-pickldy, but it is something to do for an hour. Warning, they charge extra for foreigners and for camera !! So hide it in your bag !",
          "It was fun to see the lions, but their space is a bit cramped. It is a popular place though. Many people were there when we visited.",
          "As an animal lover, i was hoping for the best, but this place is horrible. Apart from the fact that locals pay 2 bir and foreigners pay 20 bir to get in, this place should be closed down and the animals set free instantly. The locals do not seem to know how to treat animals",
          "There is nothing much in the zoo other than a couple of lions, which had been in the palace of the late Ethiopian king's palace. Near the center of town.",
          "is not what my kids impressed it is all a bit dirty but 1 euro entracen fee is ok in 30 minutes you are finished and can go further meybe to entoto mountains",
          "It is time Ethiopia wakes up and leaves behind this old behavior in treating animals. Investors, there is no nice zoo in Ethiopia to learn the Ethiopian children about wildlife and wildlife protection. Take fast your chance, Lions in cages where they can only suffer on a cement",
          "To see other creatures in such condition it sad. It is very small for kings of jungle. They need more space and preferably open place. I recently discovered a zoo out of Addis which is much much better than this. To visit this place you ought to call in advance. They have big",
          "They have 4-5 lions and you get to see them up close and being active (much unlike those in American zoos!) They don't have too many different species, but it's a nice 15 minute walk around to see the animals, before or after a visit to the mini amusement park attached to the",
          "Not the best conditions for the animals, it was still a great experience getting this close to some of the animals.",
          "There are about 8 lions in small cages. The grounds are strewn with garbage. People yell and throw things at the animals. It was one of the saddest sights I have encountered in my global travels. Don't encourage such animal cruelty by purchasing their ticket.",
          "I do not recommend visiting this place unless you like to see poor lions sitting in very small cages and being very thin, dirty and unhappy. I am sure during Haile Selassie time, the place was a much nicer and better kept location, but those times have passed and it is beter to",
          "Seeing the lions was awesome but besides that it was'nt so appealing they definitely need to spruce it up a bit",
          "I have a hard time with this \"Zoo\" - I have been 3 times and although I enjoy seeing the lions, I leave feeling sorry for them. First of all, they are OLD. Second of all, they pace in cages with cement floors - there is no \"open\" habitat for them with grass, etc. Third, the Zoo",
          "There are a lots of lions here all kept in small concrete floored cages, two gelada baboons, two vervet monkeys, a marabou stork, sone geese and two nyala. The spectacle is seeing animals kept in such dire conditions and watching the people queuing to see them. There is a small",
          "This are lion species relics, possibly the last Barbary lions, there are no weds to describe this morally and ethically inadmissible incarceration and captive conditions. Shame on you! Get them bigger more dignified and decent premises to stroll or live in what is left of their",
          "You can see the crowd enjoys the animals but here is something sad about the whole entity. Keep reminding yourself you are in Addis.",
          "..What a sad little zoo, it looked like it hadn't been updated since the 70's dingy, dark, dirty and the animals looked sad and badly looked after. Sorry Addis Try harder please!",
          "Coming from Kenya, the lions were kept in smallest cages, the place overall had not been cleaned in I would say 1 year. If you want to be appalled at treatment of such great animals then visit.",
          "The lions of the Addis Lion Zoo are fairly famous, having been kept my Ethiopian emperors for several hundred years. The zoo itself is a sad little place that could really use an investor to spruce things up. If you arrive at a meal time you will get to see the lions chomping",
          "The lions are magnificent but there cages are small and soul killing. The location near Siddist Kilo has a lot of potential but the whole place desperately needs renovation with an eye towards the needs of the animals - and the public. I liked the differential fees where us",
          "It\u00b4s not worth to see the poor, originally very majestic \"Abyssinian Lions\" in that old and narrow cages. As far as I know, it is planned to move them out of town to a much better place for this wonderful species.",
          "very sad place. they take 20 birr entrance (locals only 2 birr) and extra 20 for camera. left after 10 minutes.",
          "such terrible horrific living conditions. \"professional\" photographers that hit the metal bars on cages for good photos, people yelling and even throwing things at animals- I HAD TO LEAVE AFTER LESS THAN 7 MINUTES THERE. I was so offended at the behavior of people - and lack of",
          "I got peed on by a lion! I loved it, but I'm not sure that'd be for everyone. Shield your children from the crude mustached monkey and his obscene gestures or else you may have some awkward questions on the ride home.",
          "This may the only place most Ethiopians can see so-called wild animals, but it is really an animal-prison: an old fashioned zoo with very pathetic-looking, bored animals.",
          "Lots of locals gawking and badly caged animals while snacking on candy floss is all a bit sad. Give it a big miss.",
          "not far from the national museum, there is the zoo. It was more an ethiopian version of roller coaster than a zoo. Anyway was impressive to see 12 lions so close. Their living conditions are not exceptional...",
          "This is the 2nd \"zoo\" I have visited in Ethiopia and found about the same, sad condition. First, not sure who decided to make the zoo into a playground/restaurant/cafe with a few animals on the side. Second, the size of the cages seemed grossly inadequate for such large cats.",
          "We were looking for a nice place to visit in Addis with our almost three year old daughter. We entered the ZOO at 09.00 am. First we had a look at the lions. Five small cages with in every cage a couple. After we had seen the lions our daughter said: Let's go to the giraffes...",
          "The animal cages were far too small and looked very dirty. I couldn't stay longer than 10 minutes at this zoo.",
          "I went there few times cause my son likes seeing the lions.",
          "I'm not a huge animal rights person but this sparked even ounce of compassion that I do have for animals. People were throwing rocks and the monkeys while everyone just stood around laughing. The first time I went here the attendants were poking the lions to get them to roar",
          "Lion cages are far too small ! Nice play facilities for childern - away from the poor lions..",
          "caged lions with taunting and jeering by visitors. no educational, conservation themes....sad",
          "Needs renovation last time I saw the place, donot know now",
          "...these lions should be moved to a real National Park and let free. It's really sad to see them like this and hear them every day calling to each other. Sad, really sad.",

        "wiki": "Addis Ababa (Amharic: \u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12a0\u1260\u1263, Addis Ab\u00e4ba IPA: [ad\u02c8dis \u02c8ab\u0259ba] (listen), \"new flower\") or Addis Abeba, also known as Finfinne (Oromo: Finfinne \"natural spring\"), is the capital and largest city of Ethiopia. According to the 2007 census, the city has a population of 2,739,551 inhabitants.As a chartered city, Addis Ababa also serves as the capital city of the Oromia Region. It is where the African Union is headquartered and where its predecessor the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was based. It also hosts the headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), as well as various other continental and international organizations. Addis Ababa is therefore often referred to as \"the political capital of Africa\" for its historical, diplomatic and political significance for the continent. The city lies a few miles west of the East African Rift which splits Ethiopia into two, through the Nubian Plate and the Somali Plate.The city is populated by people from different regions of Ethiopia. It is home to Addis Ababa University.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nEntoto is one of a handful of sites put forward as a possible location for a medieval imperial capital known as Barara. This permanent fortified city was established during the early-to-mid 15th century, and it served as the main residence of several successive emperors up to the early 16th-century reign of Lebna Dengel. The city was depicted standing between Mounts Zikwala and Menegasha on a map drawn by the Italian cartographer Fra Mauro in around 1450, and it was razed and plundered by Ahmed Gragn while the imperial army was trapped on the south of the Awash River in 1529, an event witnessed and documented two years later by the Yemeni writer Arab-Faqih. The suggestion that Barara was located on Mount Entoto is supported by the very recent discovery of a large medieval town overlooking Addis Ababa located between rock-hewn Washa Mikael and the more modern church of Entoto Maryam, founded in the late 19th century by Emperor Menelik. Dubbed the Pentagon, the 30-hectare site incorporates a castle with 12 towers, along with 520 meters of stone walls measuring up to 5-meter high.The site of Addis Ababa was chosen by Empress Taytu Betul and the city was founded in 1886 by Emperor Menelik II. Menelik, as initially a King of the Shewa province, had found Mount Entoto a useful base for military operations in the south of his realm, and in 1879 he visited the reputed ruins of a medieval town and an unfinished rock church that showed proof of the medieval empire's capital in the area before the campaigns of Ahmad ibn Ibrihim. His interest in the area grew when his wife Taytu began work on a church on Mount Entoto, and Menelik endowed a second church in the area.\n\nHowever, the immediate area did not encourage the founding of a town for lack of firewood and water, so settlement actually began in the valley south of the mountain in 1886. Initially, Taytu built a house for herself near the \"Filwoha\" hot mineral springs, where she and members of the Showan Royal Court liked to take mineral baths. Other nobility and their staff and households settled in the vicinity, and Menelik expanded his wife's house to become the Imperial Palace which remains the seat of government in Addis Ababa today. The name changed to Addis Ababa and became Ethiopia's capital when Menelik II became Emperor of Ethiopia. The town grew by leaps and bounds. One of Emperor Menelik's contributions that are still visible today is the planting of numerous eucalyptus trees along the city streets.\n\nFollowing all the major engagements of their invasion, Italian troops from the colony of Eritrea entered Addis Ababa on 5 May 1936. Along with Dire Dawa, the city had been spared the aerial bombardment (including the use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas) practiced elsewhere and its railway to Djibouti remained intact. After the occupation the city served as the Duke of Aosta's capital for unified Italian East Africa until 1941, when it was abandoned in favor of Amba Alagi and other redoubts during the Second World War's East African Campaign. The city was liberated by Major Orde Wingate and negus Haile Selassie for Ethiopian Gideon Force and Ethiopian resistance in time to permit Emperor Haile Selassie's return on 5 May 1941, five years to the day after he had left. Following reconstruction, Haile Selassie helped form the Organisation of African Unity in 1963 and invited the new organization to keep its headquarters in Addis Ababa. The OAU was dissolved in 2002 and replaced by the African Union (AU), which is also headquartered in the city. The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa also has its headquarters in Addis Ababa. Addis Ababa was also the site of the Council of the Oriental Orthodox Churches in 1965.\nEthiopia has often been called the original home of mankind because of various humanoid fossil discoveries like the Australopithecine Lucy. Northeastern Africa, and the Afar region in particular, was the central focus of these claims until recent DNA evidence suggested origins in south central Ethiopian regions like present-day Addis Ababa. After analysing the DNA of almost 1,000 people around the world, geneticists and other scientists claimed people spread from what is now Addis Ababa 100,000 years ago. The research indicated that genetic diversity decreases steadily the farther one's ancestors traveled from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAddis Ababa lies at an elevation of 2,355 metres (7,726 ft) and is a grassland biome, located at 9\u00b01\u203248\u2033N 38\u00b044\u203224\u2033E. The city lies at the foot of Mount Entoto and forms part of the watershed for the Awash. From its lowest point, around Bole International Airport, at 2,326 metres (7,631 ft) above sea level in the southern periphery, Addis Ababa rises to over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) in the Entoto Mountains to the north.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nThe city is divided into 10 boroughs, called subcities (Amharic: \u12ad\u134d\u1208 \u12a8\u1270\u121b, kifle ketema), and 99 wards (Amharic: \u1240\u1260\u120c, kebele). The 10 subcities are:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAddis Ababa has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cwb) with precipitation varying considerably by the month. The city has a complex mix of highland climate zones, with temperature differences of up to 10 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F), depending on elevation and prevailing wind patterns. The high elevation moderates temperatures year-round, and the city's position near the equator means that temperatures are very constant from month to month. As such the climate would be maritime if its elevation was not taken into account, as no month is above 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) in mean temperatures.\nMid-November to January is a season for occasional rain. The highland climate regions are characterized by dry winters, and this is the dry season in Addis Ababa. During this season the daily maximum temperatures are usually not more than 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F), and the night-time minimum temperatures can drop to freezing. The short rainy season is from February to May. During this period, the difference between the daytime maximum temperatures and the night-time minimum temperatures is not as great as during other times of the year, with minimum temperatures in the range of 10\u201315 \u00b0C (50\u201359 \u00b0F). At this time of the year, the city experiences warm temperatures and a pleasant rainfall. The long wet season is from June to mid-September; it is the major winter season of the country. This period coincides with summer, but the temperatures are much lower than at other times of year because of the frequent rain and hail and the abundance of cloud cover and fewer hours of sunshine. This time of the year is characterized by dark, chilly and wet days and nights. The autumn which follows is a transitional period between the wet and dry seasons.\nThe highest temperature on record was 30.6 \u00b0C (87.1 \u00b0F) 26 February 2019, while the lowest temperature on record was 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) recorded on multiple occasions.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the latest 2007 population census conducted by the Ethiopian national statistics authorities, Addis Ababa has a total population of 2,739,551 urban and rural inhabitants. For the capital city 662,728 households were counted living in 628,984 housing units, which results in an average of 5.3 persons to a household. Although all Ethiopian ethnic groups are represented in Addis Ababa because it is the capital of the country, the largest groups include the Amhara (47.0%), Oromo (19.5%), Gurage (16.3%), Tigrayan (6.18%), Silt'e (2.94%), and Gamo (1.68%). Languages spoken as mother tongues include Amharic (71.0%), Afaan Oromo (10.7%), Gurage (8.37%), Tigrinya (3.60%), Silt'e (1.82%) and Gamo (1.03%). The religion with the most believers in Addis Ababa is Ethiopian Orthodox with 74.7% of the population, while 16.2% are Muslim, 7.77% Protestant, and 0.48% Catholic.\n\nIn the previous census, conducted in 1994, the city's population was reported to be 2,112,737, of whom 1,023,452 were men and 1,089,285 were women. At that time not all of the population were urban inhabitants; only 2,084,588 or 98.7% were. For the entire administrative council there were 404,783 households in 376,568 housing units with an average of 5.2 persons per household. The major ethnic groups included the Amhara (48.3%), Oromo (30.2%), Gurage (13.5%; 2.3% Sebat Bet, and 0.8% Sodo), Tigrayan 7.64%, Silt'e 3.98%, and foreigners from Eritrea 1.33%. Languages spoken included Amharic (51.6%), Afaan Oromo (32.0%), Gurage (6.54%), Tigrinya (5.41%), and Silt'e 2.29%. In 1994 the predominant religion was also Ethiopian Orthodox with 82.0% of the population, while 12.7% were Muslim, 3.87% Protestant, and 0.78% Catholic.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\n\n=== Standard of living ===\nAccording to the 2007 national census, 98.64% of the housing units of Addis Ababa had access to safe drinking water, while 14.9% had flush toilets, 70.7% pit toilets (both ventilated and unventilated), and 14.3% had no toilet facilities. In 2014, there were 63 public toilets in the city, with plans to build more. Values for other reported common indicators of the standard of living for Addis Ababa as of 2005 include the following: 0.1% of the inhabitants fall into the lowest wealth quintile; adult literacy for men is 93.6% and for women 79.95%, the highest in the nation for both sexes; and the civic infant mortality rate is 45 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, which is less than the nationwide average of 77; at least half of these deaths occurred in the infants' first month of life.The City is partially powered by water at the Koka Reservoir.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economic activities in Addis Ababa are diverse. According to official statistics from the federal government, some 119,197 people in the city are engaged in trade and commerce; 113,977 in manufacturing and industry; 80,391 Homemakers of different variety; 71,186 in civil administration; 50,538 in transport and communication; 42,514 in education, health and social services; 32,685 in hotel and catering services; and 16,602 in agriculture. In addition to the residents of rural parts of Addis Ababa, the city dwellers also participate in animal husbandry and cultivation of gardens. 677 hectares (1,670 acres) of land is irrigated annually, on which 129,880 quintals of vegetables are cultivated. It is a relatively clean and safe city, with the most common crimes being pickpocketing, scams and minor burglary. The city has recently been in a construction boom with tall buildings rising in many places. Various luxury services have also become available and the construction of shopping malls has recently increased. According to Tia Goldenberg of IOL, area spa professionals said that some people have labeled the city, \"the spa capital of Africa.\"Ethiopian Airlines has its headquarters on the grounds of Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourism is a growing industry within Addis Ababa and Ethiopia as a whole. The country has seen a 10% increase in tourism over the last decade, subsequently bringing an influx of tourists to Addis Ababa. In 2015, the European Council on Tourism and Trade named Ethiopia the Number One tourist spot in the world.\n\n\n== Zoo ==\n\nAddis Ababa Zoo kept 15 lions in 2011. Their hair samples were used in a genetic analysis, which revealed that they were genetically diverse. It was therefore proposed to include them in a captive breeding programme.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nPursuant to the Ethiopian Constitution of 1995, the city of Addis Ababa is one of the two federal cities that are accountable to the Federal Government of Ethiopia. The other city with the same status is Dire Dawa in the east of the country and both are federal cities. Earlier, following the establishment of the federal structure in 1991 under the Transitional Charter of Ethiopia, the City Government of Addis Ababa was one of the then new 14 regional governments. However, that structure was changed by the federal constitution in 1995 and as a result, Addis Ababa does not have statehood status.\nThe administration of Addis Ababa city consists of the Mayor, who leads the executive branch, and the City Council, which enacts city regulations. However, as part of the Federal Government, the federal legislature enacts laws that are binding in Addis Ababa. Members of the City Council are directly elected by the residents of the city and the Council, in turn, elects the Mayor among its members. The term of office for elected officials is five years. However, the Federal Government, when it deems necessary, can dissolve the City Council and the entire administration and replace it by a temporary administration until elections take place next. Residents of Addis Ababa are represented in the federal legislature, the House of Peoples' Representatives. However, the city is not represented in the House of Federation, which is the federal upper house constituted by the representatives of the member states. The executive branch under the Mayor comprises the City Manager and various branches of civil service offices.\nThe Mayor of Addis Ababa is Engineer Takele Uma Benti from the Oromo Democratic Party, ODP formerly Oromo People Democratic Organisation (OPDO), which is the member of the ruling coalition Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Engineer Takele Uma took office in 2018. His predecessor, Mr. Dirribaa Kumaa and Kumaa Dammaqsaa (also both from the ODP), were the city's mayor respectively before Takele. Before that, the Federal Government appointed Mr. Berhane Deressa to lead the temporary caretaker administration that served from 9 May 2006 to 30 October 2008 following the 2005 election crisis. In the 2005 national election, the ruling EPRDF party suffered a major defeat in Addis Ababa. However, the opposition who won in Addis Ababa did not take part in the government both on the regional and federal level. This situation forced the EPRDF-led Federal Government to assign a temporary administration until a new election was carried out. As a result, Mr. Berhane Deressa, an independent citizen, was appointed.\nSome of the notable past mayors of Addis Ababa are Arkebe Oqubay (2003\u201306), Zewde Teklu (1985\u201389), Alemu Abebe (1977\u201385) and Zewde Gebrehiwot (1960\u201369).\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nAddis Ababa is considered to be extremely safe in comparison to the other cities in the region. On a crime index, Addis Ababa scores a 44.28, putting it at a crime level of moderate. Pickpocketing and petty unarmed thefts are more common within the city. Corruption and bribery are extremely common crimes in Addis Ababa. Violent crimes are very unlikely to happen in the city.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus (Lutheran World Federation), Ethiopian Kale Heywet Church, Ethiopian Catholic Archeparchy of Addis Abeba (Catholic Church), Ethiopian Full Gospel Believers' Church. There are also Muslim mosques.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nA financial district is under construction in Addis Ababa.Mayor Kuma Demeksa embarked on a quest to improve investment for the buildings in the city. Addis Ababa is the headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and the African Union.Notable taller architecture in Addis Ababa includes the Huda Tower, Nani Tower, Bank Misr Building, as well as the approved Angola World Trade Center Tower, Abyssinia Bank Tower, Mexico Square Tower, and the $200m AU Conference Center and Office Complex.Notable buildings include St George's Cathedral (founded in 1896 and also home to a museum), Holy Trinity Cathedral (once the largest Ethiopian Orthodox Cathedral and the location of Sylvia Pankhurst's tomb) as well as the burial place of Emperor Haile Selassie and the Imperial family, and those who fought the Italian invasion during World War II.\nIn the Merkato district, which is the largest open market in Africa, is the Grand Anwar Mosque, the biggest mosque in Ethiopia built during the Italian occupation. A few meters to the southwest of the Anwar Mosque is the Raguel Church built after the liberation by Empress Menen. The proximity of the mosque and the church has symbolized the long peaceful relations between Christianity and Islam in Ethiopia. The Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family is also in the Merkato district. Near Bole International Airport is the new Medhane Alem (Savior of the World) Orthodox Cathedral, which is the second largest in Africa.\nThe Entoto Mountains start among the northern suburbs. Suburbs of the city include Shiro Meda and Entoto in the north, Urael and Bole (home to Bole International Airport) in the east, Nifas Silk in the south-east, Mekanisa in the south, and Keraniyo and Kolfe in the west. Kolfe was mentioned in Nelson Mandela's Autobiography \"A Long Walk to Freedom\", as the place he got military training.\nAddis Ababa has a distinct architectural style. Unlike many African cities, Addis Ababa was not built as a colonial settlement. This means that the city has not a European style of architecture. This changed with the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936. The Piazza district in the city center is the most evident indicator of Italian influence. The buildings are very much Italian in style and there are many Italian restaurants, as well as small cafes, and European-style shopping centers.Parks include the Africa Park, which is situated along Menelik II Avenue.\nOther features of the city include the large Mercato market, the Jan Meda racecourse, Bihere Tsige Recreation Centre and a railway line to Djibouti.\nThe city is home to the Ethiopian National Library, the Ethiopian Ethnological Museum (and former Guenete Leul Palace), the Addis Ababa Museum, the Ethiopian Natural History Museum, the Ethiopian Railway Museum and National Postal Museum.\nThere is also Menelik's old Imperial palace which remains the official seat of government, and the National Palace formerly known as the Jubilee Palace (built to mark Emperor Haile Selassie's Silver Jubilee in 1955) which is the residence of the President of Ethiopia. Jubilee Palace was also modeled after Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom. Africa Hall is located across Menelik II avenue from this Palace and is where the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is headquartered as well as most UN offices in Ethiopia. It is also the site of the founding of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), which eventually became the African Union (AU). The African Union is now housed in a new headquarters built on the site of the demolished Akaki Prison, on land donated by Ethiopia for this purpose in the south western part of the city. The Hager Fikir Theatre, the oldest theater in Ethiopia, is located at the Piazza district. Near Holy Trinity Cathedral is the art deco Parliament building, built during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, with its clock tower. It continues to serve as the seat of Parliament today. Across from the Parliament is the Shengo Hall, built by the Derg regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam as its new parliament hall. The Shengo Hall was the world's largest pre-fabricated building, which was constructed in Finland before being assembled in Addis Ababa. It is used for large meetings and conventions. Itegue Taitu Hotel, built in 1898 (Ethiopian Calendar) in the middle of the city (Piazza), was the first hotel in Ethiopia.\nMeskel Square is one of the noted squares in the city and is the site for the annual Meskel at the end of September annually when thousands gather in celebration.\nThe fossilized skeleton, and a plaster replica of the early hominid Lucy (known in Ethiopia as Dinkinesh) is preserved at the National Museum of Ethiopia.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSport facilities include Addis Ababa and Nyala Stadiums. The 2008 African Championships in Athletics were held in Addis Ababa.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe city hosts the We Are the Future center, a child care center that provides children with a higher standard of living. The center is managed under the direction of the mayor's office, and the international NGO Glocal Forum serves as the fundraiser and program planner and coordinator for the WAF child center in each city. Each WAF city is linked to several peer cities and public and private partners to create a unique international coalition.\nLaunched in 2004, the program is the result of a strategic partnership between the Glocal Forum, the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation and Mr. Hani Masri, with the support of the World Bank, UN agencies and major companies.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAddis Ababa University was founded in 1950 and was originally named \"University College of Addis Ababa\", then renamed in 1962 for the former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie I who had donated his Genete Leul Palace to be the university's main campus in the previous year. It is the home of the Institute of Ethiopian Studies and the Ethnological Museum. The city also has numerous public universities and private colleges including Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, Ethiopian Civil Service University, Admas University College, St. Mary's University, Unity University, Kotebe Metropolitan University and Rift Valley University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPublic transport is through public buses from three different companies (Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise, Sheger, Alliance), Light Rail or blue and white taxis. The taxis are usually minibuses that can seat at most twelve people, which follow somewhat pre-defined routes. The minibus taxis are typically operated by two people, the driver and a weyala who collects fares and calls out the taxi's destination. Sedan taxis work like normal taxis, and are driven to the desired destination on demand. In recent years, new taxi companies have appeared, which uses other designs, including one large company using yellow sedan taxis.\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe construction of the Addis Ababa Ring Road was initiated in 1998 to implement the city master plan and enhance peripheral development. The Ring Road was divided into three major phases that connect all the five main gates in and out of Addis Ababa with all other regions (Jimma, Bishoftu, Dessie, Gojjam and Ambo). For this project, China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the partner of Addis Ababa City Roads Authority (AACRA). The Ring Road has greatly helped to decongest and alleviate city traffic.\nIntercity bus service is provided by the Lion City Bus Services.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nThe city is served by Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, where a new terminal opened in 2003. The old Lideta Airport in the western \"Old Airport\" district is used mostly by small craft and military planes and helicopters.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nAddis Ababa originally had a railway connection with Djibouti City, with a picturesque French style railway station, but this route has been abandoned. The new Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway started operation in September 2016, running parallel to the route of the original railway line.\n\n\n=== Light rail ===\n\nAddis Ababa opened its light rail system to the public on 20 September 2015. The system is the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe Ethiopian Railway Corporation reached a funding agreement worth millions of dollars with the Export and Import Bank of China in September 2010 and the light rail project was completed in January 2015. The route is a 34.25-kilometre (21.28 mi) network with two lines; the operational line running from the center to the south of the city. Upon completion, the east\u2013west line will run from Ayat to the Torhailoch ring-road, and from Menelik Square to Merkato Bus Station, Meskel Square and Akaki.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nAddis Ababa is twinned with:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nEphraim Isaac: Scholar of Ancient Semitic Studies\nMohammed Hussein Al Amoudi: richest person in Ethiopia (worth $8.1 billion)\nHaile Gebrselassie: Ethiopian long distance runner\nKenenisa Bekele: Ethiopian long distance runner\nTedros Adhanom: Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO)\nSaladin Said: Ethiopian soccer player\nMulatu Astatke: Ethiopian Jazz musician\nMahmoud Ahmed: Ethiopian singer\nTeddy Afro: Ethiopian singer\nBethlehem Tilahun Alemu: Founder of Sole Rebels\nEt\u00e9n\u00e8sh Wassi\u00e9: Ethiopian azmari\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLarge Cities Climate Leadership Group\nAddis Ababa lion\nZewditu Hospital\nALERT (medical facility)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPankhurst, Richard (2001).

Together with the Museum of Asian Art and the Museum of European Cultures, the Ethnological Museum is considered one of the Dahlem museums, because of its location in the Dahlem district. It is one of the National Museums of Berlin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nWorld Organizations: Fact or Fiction?\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization is limited to European countries.\n\n\n\nThe Ethnological Museum features objects from pre-industrial societies\u2014notably North American Indians\u2014with a focus on non-European cultures. The origins of the collection date to as far back as the 17th century; its roots are in the Cabinet of Art and Rarities, which was assembled by the electors of Brandenburg, and the later Royal Prussian Art Cabinet, from which an \u201cethnographic collection\u201d was derived in 1829. The Ethnological Museum, founded in 1873, was destroyed in World War II. The objects that survived eventually found a permanent home in 1970.The museum contains more than 500,000 objects from around the globe as well as a great many recordings, films, and photographs. Other noteworthy segments of the collection display American archaeology, South Sea cultures, objects from East Asia, and African art. The American archaeology exhibit features the pre-Columbian peoples of Central and South America. The North American Indian collection presents historical and contemporary Native American cultures. The South Sea exhibit treats Melanesian and Australian peoples and cultures. The East Asia exhibit focuses on daily life in imperial China and on Japanese folk art. The collection of African art traces the development of African art and its misunderstanding or misidentification in the hands of colonial Europeans. The music ethnology exhibition, which opened in 2007, features 16,000 original phonograph recordings dating back to 1900, along with 2,000 shellac (pre-vinyl) recordings and many tens of thousands of digital recordings.

          "This museum is housed in the former palace of the Emperor Haile Selassie. Artefacts are varied, and include an excellent display of waka's in the death and beyond exhibit. There is also an interesting display of pillows - very much like the head rests used by the ancient",
          "This was not on our itinerary but we sourced in the guide book and it was easy to access and historically to the nation very interesting",
          "You have to go to see Lucy and the very interesting display on evolution. All a bit run down and upper floors segues into art display. Interesting pottery cabinets, clothes though a bit dusty and local culture.",
          "Fascinated to see the bones of Lucy the hominid, one of the earliest humans ever discovered. Items are well laid out and all interesting. Well worth a visit.",
          "Is it the finest museum? No, but this is a great place to learn about the complex cultures that make up Ethiopia. Various tribes are represented, but what I love about this is how the exhibits are set up not by ethnicity, but by life stage, from birth to death. Bring a",
          "It\u2019s well worth coming to this museum twice; once at the start of your journey through Ethiopia and once at the end when you\u2019ll be able to put everything into context.",
          "The Ethnography Museum which is located inside the Addis Ababa University is without a doubt the best atttraction that would open your eyes to explore Ethiopia deeply. The Muesuem was the living place for the famous Ethiopian King Hailie Sillasie, the last king of the Solomonic",
          "I visited the Ethnological Museum in Addis Ababa, which took a very long time to find as it is unsigned in the centre of the university campus in the Institute of Ethiopian Studies. It was quite a pleasant campus, though. The museum is too, though hardly worth the rave reviews",
          "Definitely better than the National Museum so if you don't have time for both do this one. Its in a former palace and has extensive and nice cultural and historical exhibits.",
          "We visited the museum on the morning before our departure. Well worth it. Very informative in English. It cost 100 birr per person for entry.",
          "We had earlier been to the National museum and were not expecting much. We were however pleasantly surprised. We hired a guide on the recommendation of our driver. The guide was well informed,spoke good English and went at just the right speed. The traditions from various tribes",
          "Apart from Hailee Salasie's bedroom and his and his wife's bathrooms (and I guess the building itself), there is not a lot going on here. It seems that whatever the museums call themselves here, they all display the same stuff. Agaian, poorly curated",
          "Interesting place. Rather dusty but good labels and descriptions. We liked seeing how the Emperor used to live. The bathrooms were fantastic.",
          "Quite a bit to see, including Haile Selasse's living quarters,. Good display of religious iconography.Weird set of steps outside built by the Italians.",
          "Probably the best museum in Addis (I've been to most of the other major ones except the Red Terror Museum). It's hidden away on the Addis University campus, but worth finding. The themes and set up of the exhibits are more coherent than the National Museum, and the displays",
          "Housed in the house (palace) of the former ruler of Ethiopia, this museum offers both an insight over the way of life of the people of Ethiopia and the way of life of its ruler. The fact that the museum is within the university provides it another appeal. The museum also has a",
          "a lot of Ethiopian treasures and history here, a must see if visiting Adddis Ababa. Lucy is fascinating as well as all the other Ethiopian treasures",
          "This is a fascinating museum, and a must for anyone interested in both Ethiopian and human history. Lots of Haile Selasse stuff (it's located in his former palace).",
          "Loved the exhibit on childhood and beyond as well as the displays on various tribes. There is no shop to purchase mementos of your visit or books on the fascinating country that is Ethiopia.",
          "Interesting but def not well curated. The artifacts are not very well shown, it is a bit messy and under protected. It is a pity since it is where you can see Lucy!",
          "The presentation of the exposition is interessant. Possible to compare different ethnies. There is enough explanations, most of all of the main practices, and not to many.",
          "Hard to find, it's hidden inside the University. But keep at it and you'll be happy when you see it. A life cycle approach to presenting the different aspects of life and people in Ethiopia.",
          "Evolution of Nomadic. History of Ethiopia is well described. Educational spread by renowned educationists are things to be self enlightenment.",
          "This former palace building houses a rather small, but very interesting museum of lives in Ethiopia. It is a good place to learn about different aspects of lives in this wonderful country. The exhibits have detailed explanations, but having a guide made it much easier for us.",
          "Great museum for African standards. Some great things are displayed inside. Unfortunately they had some problems with the lights in most of the rooms at the time we visited. But overall a very interesting place with also a nice garden.",
          "Have seen many beautiful things and took photos with lucy first and a very old car and many historical music farm tools and clothes",
          "There is a lot to see inside this little museum, but to fully appreciate it, you need to hire a guide. It's quite dark inside and the presentation could be better, but at least they managed to put it all here so that one day if they have funds and a real curator, it will be top",
          "Unfortunately they were suffering a power outage while we were there so some rooms were too dark to see, but they had very interesting displays on various regional customs and church artifacts. I very much enjoyed the preserved bedrooms and bathrooms from the imperial era.",
          "Set within Haile Selassie\u2019s former palace and surrounded by the beautiful gardens and fountains of Addis Ababa University\u2019s main campus is the enthralling Ethnological Museum.

          "Bit hard to find on the grounds of the AA University and uphill from the National Museum, but recommend you use a driver around Addis for safety/efficiency anyway. Leave 1-2 hours for this museum. Our driver was our tour guide and did a great job. Many of the displays came to",
          "Set in the gardens of the University of Addis Ababa, the previous palace of the last emperor (Haile Selassie) is a museum (and library) for the university students. Exhibits from Ethiopia's past and culture are very well displayed and the visit is very educational for anybody",

          "Great museum on the grounds of University of Addis Adeba. The building is the old palace of Haile Selassie and was turned over to the museum in the 60s. It was build in the early 20s and was the seat of the emperor, except for a periode from 1936 to 41 because of the italian",
          "I went many time in this museum with my customers and all of them are very happy there are a lot of things to see everything thing is interesting if you went this museum easily you will have ideas about Ethiopian nation nationality life style from childhood til death...",
          "While the museum gives a reasonable crash course in Ethiopian culture, you've probably already seen, heard and tasted most of it if you've spent more than a week in the country. I arrived at 4pm while the museum closes at 5. An official guide offered to show me around and",
          "For a museum that is located on the campus of Addis Ababa University, I expected a better display. The exhibits look as though they were placed there and then forgotten. There is no attempt to make the displays interesting. Have a look, but don't go out of your way.",
          "I enjoyed this museum very much for all the reasons others have cited, until I needed to go to the restroom. There was no paper (and this was early in the day) and you needed to grab a bucket of water from a large can in order to flush. There was no water in the sink to wash",
          "Way better choice for a museum in Addis. Well done, detailed, rich - a true gem for Ethiopian culture.",
          "The museum is very well laid out and takes you from birth to death in traditional Ethiopian life. The religious artwork was fascinating, but the signs on the glass cases were hard to read. I would have appreciated a better description of the \"masters of the sagging cheeks\" and",
          "Love the history and the evolution story. I think they need to improve on restoration of the amazing costumes and royal clothes. They also need to add a bit of simulation on the evolution story to make people more interested and more people will flood the place.",
          "I much preferred this to the National Museum. It had many more exhibits, much better presented. It was poignant to see the last Emperor and Empress's private bedrooms and bathrooms, too.",
          "This should be #4 of your list of things to do in Addis. I will let the rest of the TripAdvisor reviews hash out the top 3 attractions (mine are Addis Eats, Red Terror, National Museum). This is tucked waaay back into the Addis Ababa University Campus. This is the former",
          "the museum was interesting, but i think if i had time for just one museum in Addis it would be the National museum. the bullet hole in the mirror from the attempted coup was kind of fun to see and there was a lot of information on the different parts of Ethiopia and cultures.",
          "Well-presented collections of paintings, church crosses, musical instruments, local farm equipment and much else",
          "really nice array of cultural practices from the different regions. Would have liked more cohesive presentations. Selassie's bedroom was interesting--seeing the bullet mark in the mirror left an impression.",
          "Habtamu Yitay is a fully licensed and trained guide, but more than that he is a delightful young man full of enthusiasm and good will. At our request he took us to the National museum and Ethnological museum, he enquired about very particular items we wished to purchase and",
          "This is a well-organized museum with sufficient information posted for a self-guided tour. This museum is a must for anyone intersted in historical, anthropological, or religion-related topics in Ethiopia. A quick visit to the bed and baths of Emperor Haile Selassie and",

          "We almost missed the Ethnographic Museum because we had such a short time in Addis. Luckily we were able to speed through a few things on our last day and make it there before closing. Although not as big as European museums, this is the biggest museum we went to in Addis, with",
          "Nice display of Ethiopian culture and discussion of different areas and peoples that make such a varied experience in seeing this country. Emperor Haile Selassie and his Queen have their bedrooms and bathrooms on display. Don't miss the musical instruments.",
          "Good visit to do before going for a tour in Ethiopia. It helps to understand the country you are going to discover.",
          "A must! This museum displays the history and culture of Ethiopia in a great way through its different cultural groups and tribes. The displays are very well organized and the building itself is fantastic!",
          "This is a great museum. Unfortunately the day I was there the power was off so I could not see all the exhibits - but that's Africa! Well laid out with good explanations.",
          "For those who like to understand the history and development of the countries they visit, this is the place to go in Ethiopia. Located in the University in the former palace of Haile Sellasie, it has both friendly and helpful guides, and extensive written explanations to go with",

          "Take the time to see this museum if you can...it provides a rich cultural and political history of Ethiopia. The displays are somewhat shoddy compared to European standards, but look beyond them to learn about Ethiopia.",
          "The museum has a superb exhibit that displays artifacts from many of the cultures, organized by life cycle stages. It's s a wonderful way to learn about the cultures you have already seen or prepare you for those you will see. Since it is on the campus of the university you get",
          "Quite a high admission price, but great overview of the different tribes and history of Ethiopia covering thousands of years into the past into modern day.",
          "Contains a pretty good section on the various tribes, well set out from birth to death, however it's badly lit - although not nearly as bad as the rest of the museum. The art section is dominated by religious icons and related paintings. The musical instrument section has some",
          "Costs $10 and there are a few interesting things to see here so it is worth a visit but many of the displays are poorly lit and very badly curated.",
          "Housed within Haile Selassie's former palace, Museum contains exhibits & pictures from the history of Ethiopia. It also gives an insight into the traditions & various tribal diversity in Ethiopia. Suggest to hire a guide, to gather a good insight.",
          "This small museum is situated in campus of Addis Ababa University. The place is lovely. I liked the former rooms of Haile Selassie. The exhibition of the museum is focused on various aspects of Ethiopian life and culture from the birth to death.On the second floor is Art gallery",
          "It was truly one of the best museums I've been to. It is so interesting, they way they explain about Ethiopian culture. I could stay there for hours. The part with Haile Silassi is not that interesting, to say the least, and have to admit I was to exhausted to linger on the",
          "This little museum has been curated in a very interesting way, following the different stages of life. Exhibits are very well presented and informative with some great information about Ethiopian culture, displayed through a good range of exhibits. TIP: this is not the easiest",

          "The museum is very nice, much better than the National museum. It has English explanations, but even reading all of them, it shouldn't take more than 1-2 hours. No guide was needed. The location of the museum is in Addis Ababa University campus (go in the main entrance and than",
          "As a first time, visitor to Addis, I learned more here about Ethiopia than I did anywhere else. It's a great place to start your trip. However, one of the city's frequent power outages forced me to cut short my visit...and the condition of the toilets was dreadful. Basic",
          "Well worth a visit - lots to see, and lots of useful, interesting information panels to read... they set the scene well in terms of summarising the main points of each area covered.",
          "I think that is better to visit this museum at the end of your trip to Ethiopia because this place puts everything in the right context after long trip. Don't even think to visit without a guide, there are great young guides for free.",
          "HISTORY IS LIKE WINE....THE OLDER IT GETS THE BETTER... A very good attempt at the consolidation and exhibition of Ethiopia's cultural and political history under one roof and in Emperor Haile Selassie's palace compound...now housing the Addis Ababa University... A great",
          "Very interesting displays from all parts and eras of Ethiopia set in the fascinating palace of Haile Selassie. Lovely grounds and building are wonderful on their own, but each floor, room, corner holds some history or culture to be explored as well.",
          "First, I love the grounds- in the university, gardens of exotic plants. Then the museum is so full of cultural info. Love the instrument room. Unfortunately the music in each section was not working. The religious art, Haile Selassie's living quarters, and most of all the",
          "This museum, located in the spectacular palace grounds on Addis Ababa's University campus, is a delightful way to spend an hour or two. It offers a broad array of photographs, history, artwork and cultural exhibitions, and it also houses the emperor's old living quarters.",
          "Three (or were there four) floors of relatively well laid out and annotated components making up the very diverse Ethiopian culture in a clean and well lit building. It is well worth taking a couple of passes at the place when one has nothing to do on a rainy afternoon - and",
          "I visited here with a friend who is Ethiopian and we were offered an English speaking guide. I wish I had got his name- he was FANTASTIC!!!! So knowledgeable and interesting! The museum is fascinating, and gives you a real insight into the vast differences in Ethiopia-",
          "I really liked the Ethiopian art and the ornate crosses on display, as well as the house and gardens the museum is set in. 100 Birr (5 usd) entrance. Ask minibus drivers for the university, or go to Arat Kilo and then go one stop on to the university.",
          "This museum is within what was formerly Haille Selassie's Palace and is now part of the university. Very interesting insight into the numerous cultures that make up Ethiopia. Also, was really nice to see groups of school children enjoying their history.",
          "The best museum of those I visited in Ethiopia. Very good exhibits of cultural life in Ethiopia, and a good museum shop as well. Located on university grounds, which is a pleasing area.",
          "I spent about 5 days in Addis visiting a number of sites and I thought the Ethnological Museum provided the most comprehensive overview of the culture. To clarify, the Ethnological Museum is located in the Addis Ababa University campus, and it is different from the National",
          "This museum is located in Haile Selassie's old palace on the campus of Addis Ababa University. It was really neat how they converted his old home into a museum. The first floor is where you buy your tickets (don't forget that there is a foreigner versus native fee. When I",
          "I had a nice afternoon looking at the artifacts in this museum, who is at the same time the ancient house of Haile Selassie were you can visit the bathroom, bedroom. Nice visit but very small museum with a lot of traditional artifacts. Nice location in the Addis university",
          "Well laid out with a clear thread leading you through the stages of life. You do not need a guide as the explanations are clear and well written.",
          "useful to understand the cultural diversity of Ethiopia. As in many other places, is worth hiring a guide - at the entrance - who will guide through the museum and provide you background and additional details.",
          "This museum has recently doubled its prices for foreigners. It now stands at 100 birr (foreign students 50 birr, Ethiopians 5 birr, Ethiopian students 2 birr). Of course this is not a lot of money for a museum back home in New York, but it's quite a lot by Ethiopian standards,",
          "Located within walking distance of the National Museum and actually on the campus of Addis Ababa University, this museum was probably the best one I saw in the country. The toughest thing about it is the location: it\u2019s a bit of a hike from the street and in a building that",
          "Particularly great collection of Ethiopian crosses and religious exhibition. Also ethnographic information and artefacts illustrate well the culture of the country. Visit former Haile Selasye rooms as a bonus.",
          "This museum is located inside Addis Ababa University in the former palace of Haile Selassie. That alone gives it some value. But the museum itself is curated in an outdated style that archaeologists no longer really subscribe to. The upper floor was interesting though,",
          "It's probably worth visiting this museum both before and after your travelling around the country, it will give you tips for what to look out for and explanations of things you've observed along the way.. Divided into stations of the lifecycle (birth, marriage, war, religion,",
          "As many places in this country this museum could be better regarding many aspects. We must be aware of the fact what Ethiopia has been trough and what difficulties country had and still has and we should judge accordingly. One can not expect British Museum organization and",
          "It\u2019s an interesting museum to visit, although Ethiopia has great ethnological treasures and thus this museum should be more enriched. In any case, it worth a visit, if you are in Addis Ababa. No actual need for a guide there are EN signs. It\u2019s located inside the University and",

          "Located in one of the University buildings on campus (virtually no signage indicating where it is) the museum is half contemporary cultural exhibits; half a display of Christian icons and cermonial crosses. Reasonably well maintained. Biggest disappointment is that there is",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my time there ---a good overview to the cultural background of the different tribes. It is a hard task -- to show the cultureS in a coherent way. I think they mostly succeeded. Had the small gift store taken credit cards I'd have bought some things. There",
          "I expected the archaeological exhibit and \"Lucy\" to be impressive but was also pleasantly surprised with some wonderful sculptures. The entrance fee was steep which is a shame for those who would be interested but felt it too costly,",
          "The variety and richness of Ethiopian culture and heritage makes it a difficult topic to explore in depth in a short space of time. This museum gives a good intro into and overview of the subject.",
          "This is the best museum in Addis Ababa, with a large and well interpreted section on ethnology, a section on traditional musical instruments, a large collection of ancient Christian icons and crosses, Emperor Haile Selassie's private rooms, and a museum shop. And it is open on",
          "If is hard to find but a look at the photo with these reviews will help a lot. You then need to know the museum is on the first floor. Entrance 100 Birr for non-student foreigners. We collected a student guide with good English who we did tip but he didn't care that much",
          "A very interesting look at the beginning of humanity and a lot of very interesting information about recent discoveries. Interesting also to see Lucy, the world's oldest lady (skeleton). The Lucy restaurant at this venue is also well worth the visit",

          "This museum is somewhat thin on tangible items on display but more than makes up with readable, well and authoritatively written descriptions and explanations of just about everything you might like to know about some aspect of Ethiopian life, history and culture. I struggle to",
          "Although you might get eye strain from the poor lighting - they simply won't turn on the lights, this is a great visit. We enjoyed this after traveling the country and understanding a bit more about the ethnology first hand. We easily spent 2 hours on this visit.",
          "A nice museum in the campus of Addis university. about an hour tour, you can pick up a student as a guide on campus. good place for a rest from the intense city!",
          "The items displayed are well visible. Fantastic lighting in the museum. Great use of guides. The museum is however not popular with the locals. Local tourism should be encouraged. Great weekend get away even for the whole family.",
          "The museum is average but does give good explanations about Ethiopian tribes and cultures. only thing is there was no signs and nobody knew where it was spent a good few hours looking.",
          "This Museum is set out well and deals with the old history and modern history of Ethiopia. It is presented in an easy way with many local proverbs used to explain behaviours and the differences between the tribal areas. On entry there is a history of the impact of the University",
          "This is a low budget exhibition, but well worth seeing. It provides a good explanation of Ethiopian history and multi- ethnographic make up. It is a huge country with 80,000,000 people from many different groups.",
          "Good displays in the museum, however partly dark due to electricity outage. I have learned a lot about Ethiopian history and culture.",

          "they liked it a lot which means much. Can recommend to everybody it is righyt across the street to goethe institut and in a nice garden",
          "Lots of things to see at this museum. The power was out when we were there so much of it was in dark, but some really interesting exhibits. The rooms where the Emperor lived were very interesting..",
          "The exhibits are very well organized around the life cycle, and the descriptions are well-written. The lights were out in one portion of hte museaum, but an offical came by with a flashlight and offer to illuminate the narrative for my reading. For one interested in",
          "We visited in May, was an interesting walk through the university and some photograph's of Mussolini's steps. The museum was upstairs in the university. We opted for a guided tour, this was very cheap. We started with the video giving the history of Ethiopia and then went",
          "Don't miss this little museum. It is so quirky, and its photographs of the tribal customs are amazing, so are the childrens' toys",
          "If you want to know about the cultures of the local folks, this is worth a full day visit. I will not recommend going with a guide as they speed you up, and there are notices all over to read. The negative part of the visit is that the lights do not all work, so you miss a lot.",
          "There are really two museums that offer you an overview of the Ethiopian culture in Addis Ababa. The Ethiopian Museum is interesting , but this is the better one to go to . The Ethnological museum is located in the University of of Addis Ababa compound and at the Institute",
          "Getting a bit of a refresh as we were there. Plenty to see and an essential overview for any tour of the historic north.",
          "Having just visited the National Museum the day before, my expectations were fairly low. Fortunately, I was really surprised by the quality of the collection. I've seen a number of reviews that say that there isn't much signage. I'd say that there's PLENTY of signage. In fact,",
          "Great museum located in the former palace of Emperor Haile Selassie.Good collection and a wing of the museum show Haile's private quarters which remain largely unchanged since decades. Especially his bathroom is very cool and also his collection of gifts received from foreign",
          "I learnt a lot about Ethiopia's history which I didn't know much about before so because of that I spent over an hour reading everything and digesting everything I was learning. You also learn about the different regions in Ethiopia and their different costumes, crafts and",
          "A quirky museum in a pleasant, green location. There's not much in the way of signage to help you make sense of what is on display, and the museum itself is in pretty poor repair. But is costs virtually nothing to enter and you get to see the tiny bed, and really not so regal,",
          "Not exactly well maintained although the exhibits give a glimpse of this country's extensive history. Believe that with more maintenance and funding - this museum could excel/",
          "Skip the National Museum (the real Lucy is on temporary loan to Houston, Texas anyway) and go to the Ethnological Museum. It's housed in the former imperial palace of Haile Selassie and in the grounds of Addis Ababa University. The museum provides a rich and comprehensive",
          "I read a lot of good reviews about the Ethnological Museum in Addis so I decided to visit it and was not disappointed at all. The museum is located in the University campus and might be a bit tricky to find if you are not sure about where you are going, since there are no signs",
          "Very enjoyable visit, nice collection of historical artefacts relating to the history of the city. I especially enjoyed seeing the military uniforms. Recommend.",
          "Located in the University of Addis Ababa - not where Google Maps says it is. It is very informative if you are prepared to read the signs. What I like was it seemed to present the different cultures in Ethiopia without showing too much bias towards one or the other. It is heavy",
          "The bathroom and sleeping room of Haile Selassie and his wife was great. The museum gives a good insight on the ethnological stuff of Ethiopia.",

Historians and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church date it back as far as the 4th century AD pointing to its resemblance to Aksumite era churches in other regions of Ethiopia and to the Sabaen artifacts found at the site of the church. They further explain that structures in and around the church show that the area was once used as a training ground for the horsemen of the Aksumite armies of King Ezana, arguing that the area was one of the territory held by the vast Kingdom of Aksum. It is a popular tourist destination.\n\n\n== History ==\nWasha Mikael church was constructed in the Shoan architectural style with some influences from the Aksumite style. Similar to the some of the churches of Lalibela, Washa Mikael is a rock-hewn semi-monolithic church.In the 19th century, Emperor Menelik II rediscovered the structure after it was initially abandoned during the Abyssinian-Adel war. He had the Tabot of St. Michael moved from inside the church to a church he had build lower down the mountain called Yeka Mikael. He subsequently made attempts at restoring and preserving the structures of the church.The church suffered damages during the heavy bombing campaigns of the Italians during the second Italo-Ethiopian War.\nFrom above the church has a \"U\" shape also known as the letter \"\u1200\" in the Ethiopian Alphabet. This shape was meant to signify the Ge'ez phrase starting with the same letter, \"\u1200\u120d\u12ce\u1271\u1208 \u12a3\u1265 \u12a5\u121d\u12a8\u12f5\u121c \u12d0\u1208\u121d\" (Halwotule ab emkdme alem) which means \u201cBefore anything existed, God was here\u201d. The original church stood 7 meters tall and had 7 windows which represented the 7 heavens, 7 days and 7 angels.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Holy Trinity Cathedral, known in Amharic as Kidist Selassie, is the highest ranking Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo cathedral in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It was built to commemorate Ethiopia's liberation from Italian occupation and is the second most important place of worship in Ethiopia, after the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum.\n\n\n== Title ==\nThe cathedral bears the title 'Menbere Tsebaot', or 'Pure Altar'.  The church compound is the burial place for those who fought against the Italian Occupation, or those who accompanied the Emperor into exile from 1936 to 1941. The Emperor Haile Selassie and his consort the Empress Menen Asfaw are buried in the north transept of the cathedral. Other members of the Imperial Family are buried in the crypt below the church.  The High Altar of the cathedral is dedicated to 'Agaiste Alem Kidist Selassie' (Sovereigns of the World the Holy Trinity).  The other two altars in the Holy of Holies on either side of the High Altar are dedicated to St. John the Baptist and to 'Kidane Meheret' (Our Lady Covenant of Mercy).  In the south transept of the cathedral is a recently added chapel of St. Michael, which houses the Tabot or Ark of St. Michael the Archangel, which was returned to Ethiopia in February 2002 after being discovered in Edinburgh.  This relic was taken by British forces from the mountain citadel of Magdalla in 1868 during their campaign against Emperor Tewodros II.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe cathedral complex also includes the 'Bale Wold' (Feast of God the Son) Church, which is also known as the Church of the Four Heavenly Creatures.  This church served as the original Holy Trinity Monastery Church before the building of the Cathedral and dates back to the reign of Emperor Menelik II.  Other facilities include a primary and a secondary school, a monastery and the Holy Trinity Theological College, a museum and monuments housing the remains of those massacred in Addis Ababa by the Italians in 1937 in response to an assassination attempt against the Fascist Viceroy of Italian East Africa.  In addition is the monument and tomb of the officials of the imperial government who were executed by the Communist Derg regime. Holy Trinity Cathedral is the official seat of the Orthodox Archdiocese of Addis Ababa.  The Patriarchs of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church are enthroned at Holy Trinity Cathedral and all Bishops are consecrated there as well.\n\n\n== Imperial tombs ==\nThe tombs of the Emperor Haile Selassie and Empress Menen Asfaw, as well as other members of the Imperial Family, are inside Holy Trinity Cathedral. Patriarchs, Abune Tekle Haimanot and Abune Paulos of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, are buried in the churchyard, as is the famous British suffragette and anti-fascist activist Sylvia Pankhurst. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and other prominent Ethiopians are also buried there.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Holy Trinity Cathedral, Addis Ababa at Wikimedia Commons\n\nHoly Trinity Cathedral at www.sacred-destinations.com",

          "All that's been said here I found to be true. I had an excellent guide who new a lot and matched his tour to how interested I was, which was very. The grounds and the bamboo church are worth seeing. Seeing a funeral cort\u00e8ge wend it's way to the place of rest was poignant. Tipped",
          "I had been to Russian and Greek Orthodox services previously this experience was completely different. It was good Friiday and there were crowds od families on prayer mats outside. The adjoining museum is worth a visit",

          "The museum was much smaller than St George's cathedral, it was interestingly laid out but much of it is the same as you will see in the other museums and cathedral - lots of velvet capes, photos and religious items which all blur into one after a long day sightseeing in Addis.",
          "I paid to go in and then a guide appeared and (uninvited) attached himself to me for the duration. Fortunately I was able to look at the church in peace. However I was then led around the grounds when I would have much preferred to be on my own. The museum was closed (the",
          "If you happen to be in Addis, it's worth going, but there is the usual mythology and the priest tries to hit you up for more money, despite the high entrance fee. There is an interesting cross given from India, and the emperor's tomb",

          "Not much to see in this church that was built in 1942 other than the tombs of Haile Selassie and his wife. It is, however, interesting to watch what goes on outside of the church--old women kissing the walls, monks blessing people, etc.",

          "I liked how the priests were so orthodox and proud of the church. It is unusual for Africa to have a church that is so ornate. It cost 100 Birr (5 USD) and was worth the visit",
          "The church is gorgeous from the outside, and very interesting on the inside ... with murals relating to nationally significant events (independence, etc.). The Cathedral is also surrounded by graves of culturally and historical significant Ethiopians. Definitely worth a short",

        "wiki": "Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (IATA: ADD, ICAO: HAAB) is an international airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It is located in the Bole district, 6 km (3.7 mi) southeast of the city centre and 65 km (40 mi) north of Debre Zeyit. The airport was formerly known as Haile Selassie I International Airport. It is the main hub of Ethiopian Airlines, the national airline that serves destinations in Ethiopia and throughout the African continent, as well as nonstop service to Asia, Europe, North America and South America. The airport is also the base of the Ethiopian Aviation Academy. As of June 2018, nearly 450 flights per day were departing from and arriving at the airport.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1960, Ethiopian Airlines realized the runway at Lidetta was too short for its new jet aircraft, the Boeing 720. Thus a new airport was built at Bole.By December 1962 the new runway and control tower were operational. In 1997, an expansion plan was announced for the airport. This expansion was done in three phases:\n\nPhase One: Adding a parallel runway and expanding the old runway.\nPhase Two: Construction of a brand new terminal with a large parking area, a shopping complex and restaurants.\nPhase Three: Construction of the 38 m control tower (double the height of the previous one) and installation of new electrical and fire-fighting equipment.The expanded old runway and the new runway are capable of handling the Boeing 747 and Airbus A340 aircraft. The new parallel runway is connected by five entrances and exits to the old runway, which serves as a taxiway. The terminal houses a high tech security and baggage handling system built on more than 43,000 square meters of land. The terminal also has banks and duty-free shops. The new control tower was built in between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, replacing the old control tower.In 2003, the new international passenger terminal was opened, making it one of Africa's largest airport passenger terminals. The new terminal is capable of handling about 3,000 passengers an hour. This project was worth a total of 1.05 billion birr ($130 million). At the time, the airport was one of a number of airport terminal constructions that have been underway in Ethiopia.In 2006, a new cargo terminal and maintenance hangar was opened five months late. This was because of expanded specifications vastly to improve Ethiopian Airlines' handling capacity and needs. The facility can accommodate three to four aircraft at a time. This project was worth a total of 340 million birr. At the same time, the first Airbus A380 arrived at the airport to undertake tests to validate its Engine Alliance GP7200 engines' performance from high altitude airports. The airport is capable of accommodating the A380.In 2010, the Ethiopian Airports Enterprise announced another expansion project worth $27.9 million at the airport. The project will include expansion of the aircraft parking capacity from 19 to 44 in order to accommodate heavier aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and Boeing 777. In the first phase of the project, 15 parking stands will be constructed and the remaining will be completed in the next phase. The expansion will help in easing air traffic congestion due to an increase in international travel. This would lead to the new expansion plan in 2012.\n\n\n== Expansion ==\n\nExpansion of the passenger terminal, cargo space, hangar, the runway and construction of the hotel is currently being completed by Chinese state-owned companies.The expansion work is being undertaken in two phases on an 80-hectare site. The first phase of the expansion work had enabled the airport to accommodate 15 additional aircraft, reducing traffic congestion at the airport. The second phase of the expansion work will enable the airport to service 10 additional aircraft. The airport will be able to service a total of 44 aircraft upon the completion of the expansion. The airport also plans to expand the apron which purportedly can solve the persistent aircraft parking problem it faces particularly during large international conferences.In 2012, expansion of the new passenger terminal was announced. The outlay of this expansion was projected at $250 million. At the same time, a new ramp was completed and can now park 24 aircraft. Another ramp is being built for 14 more aircraft. At the same time, the first phase of expanding the taxiways and adding more aircraft parking was completed. Eventually, this will lead to the expansion of the terminal. This all falls in line with Ethiopian Airlines' plan, \"Vision 2025\".According to the CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, the east wing of the newly expanded airport was expected to be operational by the end of June 2018. The whole expansion project was completed by the end of 2018, enabling the airport to accommodate up to 22 million passengers per year. As of 23 Jan 2020 the extension is still not fully completed. The new check in area and the elevated road to it are not yet open.On 27 January 2019 Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, inaugurated the expansion to Terminal 2.\n\n\n== Further developments ==\nThe former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn had purportedly given permission to build a new international airport in the town of Mojo, 65 kilometers south of the capital's current airport. The senior official at the Ethiopian Airport Enterprise said that the officials of the enterprise and the Ministry of Transport briefed the Prime Minister about the planned grand airport project. Two other sites are also options.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe airport has two terminals with a total of 11 gates, plus more than 30 remote aircraft parking stands behind both Terminals. Terminal 1 has 4 gates and Terminal 2 has 7 gates. Terminal 1 serves Domestic and Regional flights for Ethiopian Airlines, EgyptAir, Qatar Airways, Sudan Airways, and Yemenia. Terminal 2 serves International flights and the rest of the airlines that serve the airport.In 2012, Ethiopian Airlines opened the first phase of its Cloud Nine Business Class Lounge at Bole International Airport. This will provide premium travelers with modern facilities and amenities. The second phase of the lounge's construction will include a spa, private digital lockers for passengers to stow away their bags, and a traditional Ethiopian coffee corner. Once complete, it will be three times the size of the existing lounge. Cloud Nine features a quiet corner with sleeping cots and individual reading lamps, massage chairs, and an internet corner with free Wi-Fi connection. The lounge is part of the airline's \"Vision 2025 Fast Growth Plan\".In 2017 Ethiopian Airlines Group announced that it signed $350 million contract with China Communications Construction to build a new hub, a part of which will be open to the public no later than June 2018.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nOn 18 April 1972 at 09:40, Super VC-10 5X-UVA crashed during take-off, 35 killed including 8 of 11 crew, 13 injured, 48 uninjured.\nOn 18 March 1980, Douglas C-47B ET-AGM of Ethiopian Airlines crashed while on a single engined approach to Bole International Airport. The aircraft was on a training flight.\nOn 10 March 2019, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 of Ethiopian Airlines operating as Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 bound for Nairobi crashed shortly after take off from Bole International Airport, killing all 157 people (149 passengers and 8 crew members) on board. This crash, along with the crash of Lion Air flight 610 five months earlier, led to the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of airports in Ethiopia\nList of the busiest airports in Africa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Bole International Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nAirport information for HAAB at World Aero Data.

        "wiki": "Addis Ababa (Amharic: \u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12a0\u1260\u1263, Addis Ab\u00e4ba IPA: [ad\u02c8dis \u02c8ab\u0259ba] (listen), \"new flower\") or Addis Abeba, also known as Finfinne (Oromo: Finfinne \"natural spring\"), is the capital and largest city of Ethiopia. According to the 2007 census, the city has a population of 2,739,551 inhabitants.As a chartered city, Addis Ababa also serves as the capital city of the Oromia Region. It is where the African Union is headquartered and where its predecessor the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was based. It also hosts the headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), as well as various other continental and international organizations. Addis Ababa is therefore often referred to as \"the political capital of Africa\" for its historical, diplomatic and political significance for the continent. The city lies a few miles west of the East African Rift which splits Ethiopia into two, through the Nubian Plate and the Somali Plate.The city is populated by people from different regions of Ethiopia. It is home to Addis Ababa University.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nEntoto is one of a handful of sites put forward as a possible location for a medieval imperial capital known as Barara. This permanent fortified city was established during the early-to-mid 15th century, and it served as the main residence of several successive emperors up to the early 16th-century reign of Lebna Dengel. The city was depicted standing between Mounts Zikwala and Menegasha on a map drawn by the Italian cartographer Fra Mauro in around 1450, and it was razed and plundered by Ahmed Gragn while the imperial army was trapped on the south of the Awash River in 1529, an event witnessed and documented two years later by the Yemeni writer Arab-Faqih. The suggestion that Barara was located on Mount Entoto is supported by the very recent discovery of a large medieval town overlooking Addis Ababa located between rock-hewn Washa Mikael and the more modern church of Entoto Maryam, founded in the late 19th century by Emperor Menelik. Dubbed the Pentagon, the 30-hectare site incorporates a castle with 12 towers, along with 520 meters of stone walls measuring up to 5-meter high.The site of Addis Ababa was chosen by Empress Taytu Betul and the city was founded in 1886 by Emperor Menelik II. Menelik, as initially a King of the Shewa province, had found Mount Entoto a useful base for military operations in the south of his realm, and in 1879 he visited the reputed ruins of a medieval town and an unfinished rock church that showed proof of the medieval empire's capital in the area before the campaigns of Ahmad ibn Ibrihim. His interest in the area grew when his wife Taytu began work on a church on Mount Entoto, and Menelik endowed a second church in the area.\n\nHowever, the immediate area did not encourage the founding of a town for lack of firewood and water, so settlement actually began in the valley south of the mountain in 1886. Initially, Taytu built a house for herself near the \"Filwoha\" hot mineral springs, where she and members of the Showan Royal Court liked to take mineral baths. Other nobility and their staff and households settled in the vicinity, and Menelik expanded his wife's house to become the Imperial Palace which remains the seat of government in Addis Ababa today. The name changed to Addis Ababa and became Ethiopia's capital when Menelik II became Emperor of Ethiopia. The town grew by leaps and bounds. One of Emperor Menelik's contributions that are still visible today is the planting of numerous eucalyptus trees along the city streets.\n\nFollowing all the major engagements of their invasion, Italian troops from the colony of Eritrea entered Addis Ababa on 5 May 1936. Along with Dire Dawa, the city had been spared the aerial bombardment (including the use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas) practiced elsewhere and its railway to Djibouti remained intact. After the occupation the city served as the Duke of Aosta's capital for unified Italian East Africa until 1941, when it was abandoned in favor of Amba Alagi and other redoubts during the Second World War's East African Campaign. The city was liberated by Major Orde Wingate and negus Haile Selassie for Ethiopian Gideon Force and Ethiopian resistance in time to permit Emperor Haile Selassie's return on 5 May 1941, five years to the day after he had left. Following reconstruction, Haile Selassie helped form the Organisation of African Unity in 1963 and invited the new organization to keep its headquarters in Addis Ababa. The OAU was dissolved in 2002 and replaced by the African Union (AU), which is also headquartered in the city. The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa also has its headquarters in Addis Ababa. Addis Ababa was also the site of the Council of the Oriental Orthodox Churches in 1965.\nEthiopia has often been called the original home of mankind because of various humanoid fossil discoveries like the Australopithecine Lucy. Northeastern Africa, and the Afar region in particular, was the central focus of these claims until recent DNA evidence suggested origins in south central Ethiopian regions like present-day Addis Ababa. After analysing the DNA of almost 1,000 people around the world, geneticists and other scientists claimed people spread from what is now Addis Ababa 100,000 years ago. The research indicated that genetic diversity decreases steadily the farther one's ancestors traveled from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAddis Ababa lies at an elevation of 2,355 metres (7,726 ft) and is a grassland biome, located at 9\u00b01\u203248\u2033N 38\u00b044\u203224\u2033E. The city lies at the foot of Mount Entoto and forms part of the watershed for the Awash. From its lowest point, around Bole International Airport, at 2,326 metres (7,631 ft) above sea level in the southern periphery, Addis Ababa rises to over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) in the Entoto Mountains to the north.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nThe city is divided into 10 boroughs, called subcities (Amharic: \u12ad\u134d\u1208 \u12a8\u1270\u121b, kifle ketema), and 99 wards (Amharic: \u1240\u1260\u120c, kebele). The 10 subcities are:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAddis Ababa has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cwb) with precipitation varying considerably by the month. The city has a complex mix of highland climate zones, with temperature differences of up to 10 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F), depending on elevation and prevailing wind patterns. The high elevation moderates temperatures year-round, and the city's position near the equator means that temperatures are very constant from month to month. As such the climate would be maritime if its elevation was not taken into account, as no month is above 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) in mean temperatures.\nMid-November to January is a season for occasional rain. The highland climate regions are characterized by dry winters, and this is the dry season in Addis Ababa. During this season the daily maximum temperatures are usually not more than 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F), and the night-time minimum temperatures can drop to freezing. The short rainy season is from February to May. During this period, the difference between the daytime maximum temperatures and the night-time minimum temperatures is not as great as during other times of the year, with minimum temperatures in the range of 10\u201315 \u00b0C (50\u201359 \u00b0F). At this time of the year, the city experiences warm temperatures and a pleasant rainfall. The long wet season is from June to mid-September; it is the major winter season of the country. This period coincides with summer, but the temperatures are much lower than at other times of year because of the frequent rain and hail and the abundance of cloud cover and fewer hours of sunshine. This time of the year is characterized by dark, chilly and wet days and nights. The autumn which follows is a transitional period between the wet and dry seasons.\nThe highest temperature on record was 30.6 \u00b0C (87.1 \u00b0F) 26 February 2019, while the lowest temperature on record was 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) recorded on multiple occasions.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the latest 2007 population census conducted by the Ethiopian national statistics authorities, Addis Ababa has a total population of 2,739,551 urban and rural inhabitants. For the capital city 662,728 households were counted living in 628,984 housing units, which results in an average of 5.3 persons to a household. Although all Ethiopian ethnic groups are represented in Addis Ababa because it is the capital of the country, the largest groups include the Amhara (47.0%), Oromo (19.5%), Gurage (16.3%), Tigrayan (6.18%), Silt'e (2.94%), and Gamo (1.68%). Languages spoken as mother tongues include Amharic (71.0%), Afaan Oromo (10.7%), Gurage (8.37%), Tigrinya (3.60%), Silt'e (1.82%) and Gamo (1.03%). The religion with the most believers in Addis Ababa is Ethiopian Orthodox with 74.7% of the population, while 16.2% are Muslim, 7.77% Protestant, and 0.48% Catholic.\n\nIn the previous census, conducted in 1994, the city's population was reported to be 2,112,737, of whom 1,023,452 were men and 1,089,285 were women. At that time not all of the population were urban inhabitants; only 2,084,588 or 98.7% were. For the entire administrative council there were 404,783 households in 376,568 housing units with an average of 5.2 persons per household. The major ethnic groups included the Amhara (48.3%), Oromo (30.2%), Gurage (13.5%; 2.3% Sebat Bet, and 0.8% Sodo), Tigrayan 7.64%, Silt'e 3.98%, and foreigners from Eritrea 1.33%. Languages spoken included Amharic (51.6%), Afaan Oromo (32.0%), Gurage (6.54%), Tigrinya (5.41%), and Silt'e 2.29%. In 1994 the predominant religion was also Ethiopian Orthodox with 82.0% of the population, while 12.7% were Muslim, 3.87% Protestant, and 0.78% Catholic.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\n\n=== Standard of living ===\nAccording to the 2007 national census, 98.64% of the housing units of Addis Ababa had access to safe drinking water, while 14.9% had flush toilets, 70.7% pit toilets (both ventilated and unventilated), and 14.3% had no toilet facilities. In 2014, there were 63 public toilets in the city, with plans to build more. Values for other reported common indicators of the standard of living for Addis Ababa as of 2005 include the following: 0.1% of the inhabitants fall into the lowest wealth quintile; adult literacy for men is 93.6% and for women 79.95%, the highest in the nation for both sexes; and the civic infant mortality rate is 45 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, which is less than the nationwide average of 77; at least half of these deaths occurred in the infants' first month of life.The City is partially powered by water at the Koka Reservoir.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economic activities in Addis Ababa are diverse. According to official statistics from the federal government, some 119,197 people in the city are engaged in trade and commerce; 113,977 in manufacturing and industry; 80,391 Homemakers of different variety; 71,186 in civil administration; 50,538 in transport and communication; 42,514 in education, health and social services; 32,685 in hotel and catering services; and 16,602 in agriculture. In addition to the residents of rural parts of Addis Ababa, the city dwellers also participate in animal husbandry and cultivation of gardens. 677 hectares (1,670 acres) of land is irrigated annually, on which 129,880 quintals of vegetables are cultivated. It is a relatively clean and safe city, with the most common crimes being pickpocketing, scams and minor burglary. The city has recently been in a construction boom with tall buildings rising in many places. Various luxury services have also become available and the construction of shopping malls has recently increased. According to Tia Goldenberg of IOL, area spa professionals said that some people have labeled the city, \"the spa capital of Africa.\"Ethiopian Airlines has its headquarters on the grounds of Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourism is a growing industry within Addis Ababa and Ethiopia as a whole. The country has seen a 10% increase in tourism over the last decade, subsequently bringing an influx of tourists to Addis Ababa. In 2015, the European Council on Tourism and Trade named Ethiopia the Number One tourist spot in the world.\n\n\n== Zoo ==\n\nAddis Ababa Zoo kept 15 lions in 2011. Their hair samples were used in a genetic analysis, which revealed that they were genetically diverse. It was therefore proposed to include them in a captive breeding programme.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nPursuant to the Ethiopian Constitution of 1995, the city of Addis Ababa is one of the two federal cities that are accountable to the Federal Government of Ethiopia. The other city with the same status is Dire Dawa in the east of the country and both are federal cities. Earlier, following the establishment of the federal structure in 1991 under the Transitional Charter of Ethiopia, the City Government of Addis Ababa was one of the then new 14 regional governments. However, that structure was changed by the federal constitution in 1995 and as a result, Addis Ababa does not have statehood status.\nThe administration of Addis Ababa city consists of the Mayor, who leads the executive branch, and the City Council, which enacts city regulations. However, as part of the Federal Government, the federal legislature enacts laws that are binding in Addis Ababa. Members of the City Council are directly elected by the residents of the city and the Council, in turn, elects the Mayor among its members. The term of office for elected officials is five years. However, the Federal Government, when it deems necessary, can dissolve the City Council and the entire administration and replace it by a temporary administration until elections take place next. Residents of Addis Ababa are represented in the federal legislature, the House of Peoples' Representatives. However, the city is not represented in the House of Federation, which is the federal upper house constituted by the representatives of the member states. The executive branch under the Mayor comprises the City Manager and various branches of civil service offices.\nThe Mayor of Addis Ababa is Engineer Takele Uma Benti from the Oromo Democratic Party, ODP formerly Oromo People Democratic Organisation (OPDO), which is the member of the ruling coalition Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Engineer Takele Uma took office in 2018. His predecessor, Mr. Dirribaa Kumaa and Kumaa Dammaqsaa (also both from the ODP), were the city's mayor respectively before Takele. Before that, the Federal Government appointed Mr. Berhane Deressa to lead the temporary caretaker administration that served from 9 May 2006 to 30 October 2008 following the 2005 election crisis. In the 2005 national election, the ruling EPRDF party suffered a major defeat in Addis Ababa. However, the opposition who won in Addis Ababa did not take part in the government both on the regional and federal level. This situation forced the EPRDF-led Federal Government to assign a temporary administration until a new election was carried out. As a result, Mr. Berhane Deressa, an independent citizen, was appointed.\nSome of the notable past mayors of Addis Ababa are Arkebe Oqubay (2003\u201306), Zewde Teklu (1985\u201389), Alemu Abebe (1977\u201385) and Zewde Gebrehiwot (1960\u201369).\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nAddis Ababa is considered to be extremely safe in comparison to the other cities in the region. On a crime index, Addis Ababa scores a 44.28, putting it at a crime level of moderate. Pickpocketing and petty unarmed thefts are more common within the city. Corruption and bribery are extremely common crimes in Addis Ababa. Violent crimes are very unlikely to happen in the city.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus (Lutheran World Federation), Ethiopian Kale Heywet Church, Ethiopian Catholic Archeparchy of Addis Abeba (Catholic Church), Ethiopian Full Gospel Believers' Church. There are also Muslim mosques.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nA financial district is under construction in Addis Ababa.Mayor Kuma Demeksa embarked on a quest to improve investment for the buildings in the city. Addis Ababa is the headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and the African Union.Notable taller architecture in Addis Ababa includes the Huda Tower, Nani Tower, Bank Misr Building, as well as the approved Angola World Trade Center Tower, Abyssinia Bank Tower, Mexico Square Tower, and the $200m AU Conference Center and Office Complex.Notable buildings include St George's Cathedral (founded in 1896 and also home to a museum), Holy Trinity Cathedral (once the largest Ethiopian Orthodox Cathedral and the location of Sylvia Pankhurst's tomb) as well as the burial place of Emperor Haile Selassie and the Imperial family, and those who fought the Italian invasion during World War II.\nIn the Merkato district, which is the largest open market in Africa, is the Grand Anwar Mosque, the biggest mosque in Ethiopia built during the Italian occupation. A few meters to the southwest of the Anwar Mosque is the Raguel Church built after the liberation by Empress Menen. The proximity of the mosque and the church has symbolized the long peaceful relations between Christianity and Islam in Ethiopia. The Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family is also in the Merkato district. Near Bole International Airport is the new Medhane Alem (Savior of the World) Orthodox Cathedral, which is the second largest in Africa.\nThe Entoto Mountains start among the northern suburbs. Suburbs of the city include Shiro Meda and Entoto in the north, Urael and Bole (home to Bole International Airport) in the east, Nifas Silk in the south-east, Mekanisa in the south, and Keraniyo and Kolfe in the west. Kolfe was mentioned in Nelson Mandela's Autobiography \"A Long Walk to Freedom\", as the place he got military training.\nAddis Ababa has a distinct architectural style. Unlike many African cities, Addis Ababa was not built as a colonial settlement. This means that the city has not a European style of architecture. This changed with the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936. The Piazza district in the city center is the most evident indicator of Italian influence. The buildings are very much Italian in style and there are many Italian restaurants, as well as small cafes, and European-style shopping centers.Parks include the Africa Park, which is situated along Menelik II Avenue.\nOther features of the city include the large Mercato market, the Jan Meda racecourse, Bihere Tsige Recreation Centre and a railway line to Djibouti.\nThe city is home to the Ethiopian National Library, the Ethiopian Ethnological Museum (and former Guenete Leul Palace), the Addis Ababa Museum, the Ethiopian Natural History Museum, the Ethiopian Railway Museum and National Postal Museum.\nThere is also Menelik's old Imperial palace which remains the official seat of government, and the National Palace formerly known as the Jubilee Palace (built to mark Emperor Haile Selassie's Silver Jubilee in 1955) which is the residence of the President of Ethiopia. Jubilee Palace was also modeled after Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom. Africa Hall is located across Menelik II avenue from this Palace and is where the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is headquartered as well as most UN offices in Ethiopia. It is also the site of the founding of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), which eventually became the African Union (AU). The African Union is now housed in a new headquarters built on the site of the demolished Akaki Prison, on land donated by Ethiopia for this purpose in the south western part of the city. The Hager Fikir Theatre, the oldest theater in Ethiopia, is located at the Piazza district. Near Holy Trinity Cathedral is the art deco Parliament building, built during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, with its clock tower. It continues to serve as the seat of Parliament today. Across from the Parliament is the Shengo Hall, built by the Derg regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam as its new parliament hall. The Shengo Hall was the world's largest pre-fabricated building, which was constructed in Finland before being assembled in Addis Ababa. It is used for large meetings and conventions. Itegue Taitu Hotel, built in 1898 (Ethiopian Calendar) in the middle of the city (Piazza), was the first hotel in Ethiopia.\nMeskel Square is one of the noted squares in the city and is the site for the annual Meskel at the end of September annually when thousands gather in celebration.\nThe fossilized skeleton, and a plaster replica of the early hominid Lucy (known in Ethiopia as Dinkinesh) is preserved at the National Museum of Ethiopia.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSport facilities include Addis Ababa and Nyala Stadiums. The 2008 African Championships in Athletics were held in Addis Ababa.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe city hosts the We Are the Future center, a child care center that provides children with a higher standard of living. The center is managed under the direction of the mayor's office, and the international NGO Glocal Forum serves as the fundraiser and program planner and coordinator for the WAF child center in each city. Each WAF city is linked to several peer cities and public and private partners to create a unique international coalition.\nLaunched in 2004, the program is the result of a strategic partnership between the Glocal Forum, the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation and Mr. Hani Masri, with the support of the World Bank, UN agencies and major companies.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAddis Ababa University was founded in 1950 and was originally named \"University College of Addis Ababa\", then renamed in 1962 for the former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie I who had donated his Genete Leul Palace to be the university's main campus in the previous year. It is the home of the Institute of Ethiopian Studies and the Ethnological Museum. The city also has numerous public universities and private colleges including Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, Ethiopian Civil Service University, Admas University College, St. Mary's University, Unity University, Kotebe Metropolitan University and Rift Valley University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPublic transport is through public buses from three different companies (Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise, Sheger, Alliance), Light Rail or blue and white taxis. The taxis are usually minibuses that can seat at most twelve people, which follow somewhat pre-defined routes. The minibus taxis are typically operated by two people, the driver and a weyala who collects fares and calls out the taxi's destination. Sedan taxis work like normal taxis, and are driven to the desired destination on demand. In recent years, new taxi companies have appeared, which uses other designs, including one large company using yellow sedan taxis.\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe construction of the Addis Ababa Ring Road was initiated in 1998 to implement the city master plan and enhance peripheral development. The Ring Road was divided into three major phases that connect all the five main gates in and out of Addis Ababa with all other regions (Jimma, Bishoftu, Dessie, Gojjam and Ambo). For this project, China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the partner of Addis Ababa City Roads Authority (AACRA). The Ring Road has greatly helped to decongest and alleviate city traffic.\nIntercity bus service is provided by the Lion City Bus Services.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nThe city is served by Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, where a new terminal opened in 2003. The old Lideta Airport in the western \"Old Airport\" district is used mostly by small craft and military planes and helicopters.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nAddis Ababa originally had a railway connection with Djibouti City, with a picturesque French style railway station, but this route has been abandoned. The new Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway started operation in September 2016, running parallel to the route of the original railway line.\n\n\n=== Light rail ===\n\nAddis Ababa opened its light rail system to the public on 20 September 2015. The system is the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe Ethiopian Railway Corporation reached a funding agreement worth millions of dollars with the Export and Import Bank of China in September 2010 and the light rail project was completed in January 2015. The route is a 34.25-kilometre (21.28 mi) network with two lines; the operational line running from the center to the south of the city. Upon completion, the east\u2013west line will run from Ayat to the Torhailoch ring-road, and from Menelik Square to Merkato Bus Station, Meskel Square and Akaki.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nAddis Ababa is twinned with:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nEphraim Isaac: Scholar of Ancient Semitic Studies\nMohammed Hussein Al Amoudi: richest person in Ethiopia (worth $8.1 billion)\nHaile Gebrselassie: Ethiopian long distance runner\nKenenisa Bekele: Ethiopian long distance runner\nTedros Adhanom: Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO)\nSaladin Said: Ethiopian soccer player\nMulatu Astatke: Ethiopian Jazz musician\nMahmoud Ahmed: Ethiopian singer\nTeddy Afro: Ethiopian singer\nBethlehem Tilahun Alemu: Founder of Sole Rebels\nEt\u00e9n\u00e8sh Wassi\u00e9: Ethiopian azmari\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLarge Cities Climate Leadership Group\nAddis Ababa lion\nZewditu Hospital\nALERT (medical facility)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPankhurst, Richard (2001).

          "Generally, Addis Ababa is not very busy capital city. But, visiting Merkato market (the biggest of its kind in Africa) is a real experience to see the other side of Addis Ababa. Best spots of Merkato to visit are the chat (mild stimulant locals chew) market, the local spice",

          "Too busy, Too many beggars, Too many people asking to be your guide. (dozens when you arrive) Prices not much lower as in Shola market where it is much easier to find things as it is smaller. Also a long way to go. When unlucky you need 1,5 hour to find a parking place or when",
          "I've been to over 25 countries and have seen it all but ... Merkato is its own beast. I booked a tour with Yayehyrad Tesfaye Asfaw through WhatsApp. He was very nice and on the next day picked me up early morning at my hotel near the airport. First we went for a cup of coffee",
          "Wondering where all the shops are in Addis Ababa? They are here. Everything you could want to buy, crammed into tons of stalls. You come here to see, not to shop; as a foreigner, you draw far too much attention in the small stalls and the expensive indoor shops that are there",
          "Had not originally planned to visit the Merkato during my short trip, but am very glad I went. Fast-paced market with just about every type of business under the sun going on. From food, to souvenirs, to building materials, it is an interesting slice of business life. Even if",

          "A bustling, noisy, chaotic market best visited with a local guide (Yared!!). Great place to buy your souvenirs and some gifts for yourself and also to observe a functioning market. Go before noon and wear closed-toed shoes for uneven surfaces and mud underfoot. It is crowded,",
          "Merkato is well worth a visit. We chose to do so with Yared and Joseph as part of their full day city tour, which I highly recommend! The market is huge. It\u2019s narrow. It\u2019s impossible to know where to go and what to see without a guide. If you go alone, you just will not get the",
          "Theres nothing negative in the world I could possibly say about Yared and Joseph. I set up the tour with them very last minute, told them what I wanted to see and they made it happen. not only did they take me to all of these places, but they gave me history, language, and",
          "If you are visiting the Merkato, I strongly suggest to contact Yared, and ask about his associate Joseph. Joseph is very knowledgeable about the Merkato, Addis and Ethiopia in general. I wanted to take photos in the Merkato, and Joseph made it easy to explore less known parts",

          "Had an excellent 1 day tour of The Land of Origins. Thanks to our guide Yared who was excellent at his job which he does with the extra passion required to make a difference. The driver Usman was a good part of d team too,great guys. Will definitely call him up whenever I visit",

Oromo: Itoophiyaa, Somali: Itoobiya, Tigrinya: \u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb), officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, is a landlocked country in  East Africa. It shares borders with Eritrea to the north, Djibouti to the northeast, Somalia to the east, Kenya to the south, South Sudan to the west and Sudan to the northwest. With over 109 million inhabitants as of 2019, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world and the second-most populous nation on the African continent (after Nigeria). The country has a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres (420,000 sq mi). Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa, which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the African and Somali tectonic plates. Ethiopian national identity is grounded in the historic and contemporary roles of Christianity and Islam, and the independence of Ethiopia from foreign rule, stemming from the various ancient Ethiopian kingdoms of antiquity.Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia. It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond. According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era. Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BC, Ethiopia's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history. Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba, under its first king, Menelik I. In the first centuries, the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region, followed by the Ethiopian Empire c. 1137.\nDuring the late\u201319th-century Scramble for Africa, Ethiopia and Liberia were the only two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power, and many newly independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours. However, the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia (part of Italian East Africa), until it was liberated during World War II. During the Italian rule, the government abolished slavery, a practice that existed in the country for centuries, and urbanization steadily increased. Ethiopia was also the first independent African member of the 20th-century League of Nations and the United Nations. In 1974, the Ethiopian monarchy under Haile Selassie was overthrown by the Derg, a communist military government backed by the Soviet Union. In 1987, the Derg established the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, but it was overthrown in 1991 by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, which has been the ruling political coalition since.\nEthiopia and Eritrea use the ancient Ge'ez script, which is one of the oldest alphabets still in use in the world. They follow the Ethiopian calendar, which is approximately seven years and three months behind the Gregorian calendar. A majority of the population adheres to Christianity (mainly the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and P'ent'ay), and the historical Kingdom of Aksum was one of the first states to officially adopt the religion, whereas around a third follows Islam (primarily Sunni). The country is the site of the Islamic Migration to Abyssinia and the oldest Muslim settlement in Africa, at Negash. A substantial population of Ethiopian Jews, known as Bete Israel, also resided in Ethiopia until the 1980s. Ethiopia is a multilingual nation, with around 80 ethnolinguistic groups, the four largest of which are the Oromo, Amhara, Somali and Tigrayans. Most people in the country speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches. Additionally, Omotic languages are spoken by ethnic minority groups inhabiting the southern regions. Nilo-Saharan languages are also spoken by the nation's Nilotic ethnic minorities. Oromo is the most populous language by native speakers, while Amharic is the most populous by number of total speakers and serves as the working language in the federal government. Ge'ez remains important as a liturgical language for both the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and for the Beta Israel.\nThe nation is a land of natural contrasts, with its vast fertile west, its forests and its numerous rivers, and the world's hottest settlement of Dallol in its north. The Ethiopian Highlands are the largest continuous mountain ranges in Africa, and the Sof Omar Caves contains the largest cave on the continent. Ethiopia also has the second-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. Additionally, the sovereign state is a founding member of the UN, the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned Movement, the G77 and the Organisation of African Unity. Its capital city, Addis Ababa, serves as the headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Standby Force and many of the global NGOs focused on Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, Ethiopia experienced civil conflicts and communist purges, which hindered its economy. The country has since recovered and as of 2010 has the largest economy (by GDP) in East Africa, as well as having the largest population in the region. Despite these improvements, it remains one of the world's poorest countries. In addition to poverty, Ethiopia faces hunger, corruption, weak infrastructure, and poor respect for human rights and access to health and education (with an illiteracy rate of 51%), ranking in the worst quartile on the Human Development Index.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Greek name \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03b1 (from \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03af\u03bf\u03c8, Aithiops, \"an Ethiopian\") is a compound word, derived from the two Greek words, from \u03b1\u1f34\u03b8\u03c9 + \u1f64\u03c8 (aitho \"I burn\" + ops \"face\"). According to the Perseus Digital Library, the designation properly translates as Burnt-face in noun form and red-brown in adjectival form. The historian Herodotus used the appellation to denote those parts of Africa South of the Sahara that were then known within the Ecumene (inhabitable world). However, the Greek formation may be a folk etymology for the Ancient Egyptian term athtiu-abu, which means 'robbers of hearts'. This Greek name was borrowed into Amharic as \u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb, \u02be\u012aty\u014d\u1e57\u1e57y\u0101.\nIn Greco-Roman epigraphs, Aethiopia was a specific toponym for ancient Nubia. At least as early as c. 850, the name Aethiopia also occurs in many translations of the Old Testament in allusion to Nubia. The ancient Hebrew texts identify Nubia instead as Kush. However, in the New Testament, the Greek term Aithiops does occur, referring to a servant of the Kandake, the queen of Kush.Following the Hellenic and Biblical traditions, the Monumentum Adulitanum, a third century inscription belonging to the Aksumite Empire, indicates that Aksum's then ruler governed an area which was flanked to the west by the territory of Ethiopia and Sasu. The Aksumite King Ezana would eventually conquer Nubia the following century, and the Aksumites thereafter appropriated the designation \"Ethiopians\" for their own kingdom. In the Ge'ez version of the Ezana inscription, A\u1f30\u03b8\u03b9\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 is equated with the unvocalized \u1e24b\u0161t and \u1e24b\u015bt (\u1e24abashat), and denotes for the first time the highland inhabitants of Aksum. This new demonym would subsequently be rendered as '\u1e25bs ('A\u1e25b\u0101sh) in Sabaic and as \u1e24abasha in Arabic.In the 15th-century Ge'ez Book of Aksum, the name is ascribed to a legendary individual called Ityopp'is. He was an extra-Biblical son of Cush, son of Ham, said to have founded the city of Axum.In English, and generally outside of Ethiopia, the country was once historically known as Abyssinia. This toponym was derived from the Latinized form of the ancient Habash.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nSeveral important finds have propelled Ethiopia and the surrounding region to the forefront of palaeontology. The oldest hominid discovered to date in Ethiopia is the 4.2 million year old Ardipithicus ramidus (Ardi) found by Tim D. White in 1994. The most well known hominid discovery is Australopithecus afarensis (Lucy). Known locally as Dinkinesh, the specimen was found in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia's Afar Region in 1974 by Donald Johanson, and is one of the most complete and best preserved adult Australopithecine fossils ever uncovered. Lucy's taxonomic name refers to the region where the discovery was made. The hominid is estimated to have lived 3.2 million years ago.Ethiopia is also considered one of the earliest sites of the emergence of anatomically modern humans, Homo sapiens. The oldest of these local fossil finds, the Omo remains, were excavated in the southwestern Omo Kibish area and have been dated to the Middle Paleolithic, around 200,000 years ago. Additionally, skeletons of Homo sapiens idaltu were found at a site in the Middle Awash valley. Dated to approximately 160,000 years ago, they may represent an extinct subspecies of Homo sapiens, or the immediate ancestors of anatomically modern humans. Archaic Homo sapiens fossils excavated at the Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco have since been dated to an earlier period, about 300,000 years ago, while Omo-Kibish I (Omo I) from southern Ethiopia is the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known (196 \u00b1 5 ka).According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing Neolithic era from the family's proposed urheimat (\"original homeland\") in the Nile Valley, or the Near East. Other scholars propose that the Afroasiatic family developed in situ in the Horn, with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there.In 2019, archaeologists discovered a 30,000-year-old Middle-Stone Age rock shelter at the Fincha Habera site in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia at an elevation of 3,469 metres above sea level. At this high altitude humans are susceptible both to hypoxia and to extreme weather. According to a study published in the journal Science, this dwelling is proof of the earliest permanent human occupation at high altitude yet discovered. Thousands of animal bones, hundreds of stone tools, and ancient fireplaces were discovered, revealing a diet that featured giant mole rats.Evidence of some of the earliest known stone-tipped projectile weapons (a characteristic tool of Homo sapiens), the stone tips of javelins or throwing spears, were discovered in 2013 at the Ethiopian site of Gademotta, and date to around 279,000 years ago. In 2019, further evidence of Middle Stone Age complex projectile weapons was found at Aduma, also in Ethiopia, dated 100,000-80,000 years ago, in the form of points considered likely to belong to darts delivered by spear throwers.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nAround the 8th century BC, a kingdom known as D\u02bfmt was established in Tigray, in northern Ethiopia, and Eritrea. The polity's capital was located at Yeha, in northern Ethiopia. Most modern historians consider this civilization to be a native Ethiopian one, although Sabaean-influenced because of the latter's hegemony of the Red Sea.Other scholars regard D\u02bfmt as the result of a union of Afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the Cushitic and Semitic branches; namely, local Agaw peoples and Sabaeans from South Arabia. However, Ge'ez, the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia, is thought to have developed independently from Sabaean, one of the South Semitic languages. As early as 2000 BC, other Semitic speakers were living in Ethiopia and Eritrea where Ge'ez developed. Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the Ethiopian civilization of D\u02bfmt or some other proto-Aksumite state.\n\nAfter the fall of D\u02bfmt during the fourth century BC, the Ethiopian plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms. In the first century AD, the Kingdom of Aksum emerged in what is now Tigray and Eritrea. According to the medieval Book of Aksum, the kingdom's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush. Aksum would later at times extend its rule into Yemen on the other side of the Red Sea. The Persian prophet Mani listed Aksum with Rome, Persia, and China as one of the four great powers of his era, during the 3rd century.Around 316 AD, Frumentius and his brother Edesius from Tyre accompanied their uncle on a voyage to Ethiopia. When the vessel stopped at a Red Sea port, the natives killed all the travellers except the two brothers, who were taken to the court as slaves. They were given positions of trust by the monarch, and they converted members of the royal court to Christianity. Frumentius became the first bishop of Aksum. A coin dated to 324 shows that Ethiopia was the second country to officially adopt Christianity (after Armenia did so in 301), although the religion may have been at first confined to court circles; it was the first major power to do so.\nThe weakened Axumite dynasty came to an end in the 9th century when Yodit defeated the last king of the dynasty. Empress Yodit's reign, which lasted for 40 years, aimed to abolish Christianity (a religion first accepted by King Ezana of the Axumite dynasty) by burning down churches and crucifying people who remained faithful to the orthodox Tewahedo church, which at the time was considered as the religion of the state. The Empress tried to force many people to change their religion and destroyed much historical heritage of the Axumite dynasty earning her the epithet of Yodit Gudit (in Amharic \u12ee\u12f2\u1275 \u1309\u12f2\u1275). Her reign finally came to an end in 912 following her defeat by the first leader of the Zagwe dynasty. The reign of the Zagwe dynasty came to an end by the rise of Yekuno Amlak.\n\n\n=== During Muhammad's era ===\n\nThe first interaction that the Islamic Prophet Muhammad had with Ethiopia was during the reign of A\u1e63\u1e25ama ibn Abjar, who was at the time the Emperor of Aksum and gave refuge to several Muslims in the Kingdom of Aksum in 614 AD. According to other authors, Ashama may have been the same person as king Armah, or his father or son. Taddesse Tamrat records that the inhabitants of Wiqro, where the ruler is known as Ashamat al-Negashi, claim that his tomb is located in their village.Muhammad's second interaction with Ethiopia was during the Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha, when he sent Amr bin Umayyah al-Damri to the King of Ethiopia (then Abyssinia).\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe Zagwe dynasty ruled many parts of present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea between the early 12th and late 13th century. The name of the dynasty is derived from the Cushitic-speaking Agaw of northern Ethiopia. From 1270 AD until the Zemene Mesafint (Age of Princes), the Solomonic dynasty governed the Ethiopian Empire.In the early 15th century, Ethiopia sought to make diplomatic contact with European kingdoms for the first time since the Aksumite era. A letter from Henry IV of England to the Emperor of Abyssinia survives. In 1428, Yeshaq I sent two emissaries to Alfonso V of Aragon, who sent return emissaries. They failed to complete the return trip. The first continuous relations with a European country began in 1508 with Portugal under Dawit II (Lebna Dengel), who had just inherited the throne from his father. In 1487, King John II of Portugal sent two emissaries to the Orient, Pero da Covilh\u00e3 and Afonso de Paiva. Afonso would die on this mission.\n\n\n=== The Portuguese allied ===\nThis proved to be an important development, for when the Empire was subjected to an occupation led by the Adal Sultanate's general and imam, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (called \"Gra\u00f1\u2009\" \"the Left-handed\"), Portugal assisted the Ethiopian emperor by sending weapons and four hundred men, who helped his son Gelawdewos defeat Ahmad and re-establish his rule.This Abyssinian\u2013Adal War was also one of the first proxy wars in the region, as the Ottoman Empire and Portugal took sides in the conflict.\nWhen Emperor Susenyos I converted to Roman Catholicism in 1624, years of revolt and civil unrest followed, resulting in thousands of deaths. The Jesuit missionaries had offended the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo faith of the local Ethiopians. In June 1632, Fasilides, Susenyos' son, declared the state religion again to be the Ethiopian Orthodoxy. He expelled the Jesuit missionaries and other Europeans.\n\n\n=== Aussa Sultanate ===\n\nThe Sultanate of Aussa or \"Afar Sultanate\" succeeded the earlier Imamate of Aussa. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577 when Muhammed Jasa moved his capital from Harar to Aussa (Asaita) with the split of the Adal Sultanate into the Sultanate of Aussa and the Sultanate of Harar. At some point after 1672, the Sultanate of Aussa declined and temporarily came to an end in conjunction with Imam Umar Din bin Adam's recorded ascension to the throne.The Sultanate was subsequently re-established by Kedafu around the year 1734. It was thereafter ruled by his Mudaito Dynasty. The primary symbol of the Sultan was a silver baton, which was considered to have magical properties.\n\n\n=== Zemene Mesafint ===\n\nBetween 1755 and 1855, Ethiopia experienced a period of isolation referred to as the Zemene Mesafint or \"Age of Princes\". The Emperors became figureheads, controlled by regional lords and noblemen like Ras Mikael Sehul of Tigray, Ras Wolde Selassie of Tigray, and by the Were ShehYejju Oromo dynasty, such as Ras Gugsa of Yejju. Prior to the Zemene Mesafint, King Iyoas had introduced Oromo as the language of the court from Amharic to Afaan Oromo.\n\nEthiopian isolationism ended following a British mission that concluded an alliance between the two nations, but it was not until 1855 that the Amhara kingdoms of northern Ethiopia (Gonder, Gojam, Shoa) were briefly united after the power of the Emperor was restored beginning with the reign of Tewodros II.  Tewodros had been born in Begemder from a nobleman of Qwara, where the Qwara dialect of the Agaw language is spoken.\nUpon his ascent, he began modernizing Ethiopia and recentralizing power in the Emperor. Ethiopia began to take part in world affairs once again.But Tewodros suffered several rebellions inside his empire. Northern Oromo militias, Tigrayan rebellion, and the constant incursion of Ottoman Empire and Egyptian forces near the Red Sea brought the weakening and the final downfall of Tewodros II. He killed himself in 1868 during his last fight with the British Expedition to Abyssinia at the Battle of Magdala.\nAfter Tewodros' death, Tekle Giyorgis II was proclaimed Emperor but was defeated in the Battles of Zulawu (21 June 1871) and Adua (11 July 1871).\n\nThe victorious Mercha Kassai was subsequently declared Yohannes IV on 21 January 1872. In 1875 and 1876, Turkish/Egyptian forces, accompanied by many European and American 'advisors', twice invaded Abyssinia but were initially defeated: once at the Battle of Gundet losing 800 men, and then in the second invasion, decisively defeated by Emperor Yohannes IV at the Battle of Gura on 7 March 1875, where the invading forces lost at least 3000 men by death or captured. From 1885 to 1889, Ethiopia joined the Mahdist War allied to Britain, Turkey, and Egypt against the Sudanese Mahdist State. In 1887 Menelik king of Shewa invaded the Emirate of Harar after his victory at the Battle of Chelenqo. On 10 March 1889, Yohannes IV was killed by the Sudanese Khalifah Abdullah's army whilst leading his army in the Battle of Gallabat (also called Battle of Metemma).\n\n\n=== From Menelik II to Adwa (1889\u20131913) ===\n\nEthiopia in roughly its current form began under the reign of Menelik II, who was Emperor from 1889 until his death in 1913. From his base in the central province of Shewa, Menelik set out to annex territories to the south, east and west, areas inhabited by the Oromo, Sidama, Gurage, Welayta, and other peoples. He did this with the help of Ras Gobana Dacche's Shewan Oromo militia, which occupied lands that had not been held since Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi's war, as well as other areas that had never been under Ethiopian sovereignty. Menelik's campaign against Oromos outside his army was largely in retaliation for centuries of Oromo expansionism and the Zemene Mesafint, a period during which a succession of Oromo feudal rulers dominated the highlanders. Chief among these was the Yejju dynasty, which included Aligaz of Yejju and his brother Ali I of Yejju. Ali I founded the town of Debre Tabor in the Amhara Region, which became the dynasty's capital.\n\nMenelik was born from King Hailemelekot of Shewa and his mother Ejegayehu Lema Adeyamo who was a servant in the royal household. He had been born at Angolala in an Oromo area and had lived his first twelve years with Shewan Oromos with whom he thus had much in common. During his reign, Menelik II advanced road construction, electricity and education; the development of a central taxation system and the foundation and building of the city of Addis Ababa\u2014which became the capital of Shewa Province in 1881. After he ascended to the throne in 1889, it was renamed Addis Ababa, the new capital of Abyssinia.\nFor his leadership, despite opposition from more traditional elements of society, Menelik II is heralded as a national hero. Menelik had signed the Treaty of Wichale with Italy in May 1889 in which Italy would recognize Ethiopia's sovereignty so long as Italy could control an area north of Ethiopia (now part of modern Eritrea). In return, Italy was to provide Menelik with weapons and support him as emperor. The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to expand their territorial claims. This conflict erupted in the Battle of Adwa on 1 March 1896 in which Italy's colonial forces were defeated by the Ethiopians.About a third of the population died in the Great Ethiopian Famine (1888 to 1892).\n\n\n=== Haile Selassie I era (1916\u20131974) and Italian Ethiopia ===\n\nThe early 20th century was marked by the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie (Ras Tafari). Haile Selassie I was born to parents with ethnic links to three of Ethiopia's Afroasiatic-speaking populations: the Oromo and Amhara, the country's two largest ethnic groups, as well as the Gurage. He came to power after Iyasu V was deposed, and undertook a nationwide modernization campaign from 1916, when he was made a Ras and Regent (Inderase) for the Empress Regnant, Zewditu, and became the de facto ruler of the Ethiopian Empire. Following Zewditu's death, on 2 November 1930, he succeeded her as emperor.The independence of Ethiopia was interrupted by the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, beginning when it was invaded by Fascist Italy in early October 1935, and Italian occupation of the country (1936\u20131941). During this time, Haile Selassie appealed to the League of Nations in 1935, delivering an address that made him a worldwide figure, and the 1935 Time Man of the Year. As the majority of the Ethiopian population lived in rural towns, Italy faced continued resistance and ambushes in urban centres throughout its occupation. Haile Selassie fled into exile in Fairfield House, Bath, England. Mussolini was able to proclaim Italian Ethiopia and the assumption of the imperial title by the Italian king Vittorio Emanuele III.In 1937, the Italian massacre of Yekatit 12 took place, in which as many as 30,000 civilians were killed and many others imprisoned. This massacre was a reprisal for the attempted assassination of Rodolfo Graziani, the viceroy of Italian East Africa.The Italians made investments in Ethiopian infrastructure development during their occupation. They created the so-called \"imperial road\" between Addis Ababa and Massaua. More than 900 km of railways were reconstructed, dams and hydroelectric plants were built, and many public and private companies were established. The Italian government abolished slavery, a practice that existed in the country for centuries.Following the entry of Italy into World War II, British Empire forces, together with the Arbegnoch (literally, \"patriots\", referring to armed resistance soldiers) restored the sovereignty of Ethiopia in the course of the East African Campaign in 1941. An Italian guerrilla warfare campaign continued until 1943. This was followed by British recognition of Ethiopia's full sovereignty, without any special British privileges, when the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement was signed in December 1944. Under the peace treaty of 1947, Italy recognised the sovereignty and independence of Ethiopia.\nOn 26 August 1942, Haile Selassie issued a proclamation that removed Ethiopia's legal basis for slavery. Ethiopia had between two and four million slaves in the early 20th century, out of a total population of about eleven million.In 1952, Haile Selassie orchestrated a federation with Eritrea. He dissolved this in 1962 and annexed Eritrea, resulting in the Eritrean War of Independence. Haile Selassie played a leading role in the formation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.Opinion within Ethiopia turned against Haile Selassie I owing to the worldwide 1973 oil crisis. This oil crisis caused a sharp increase in gasoline prices starting on 13 February 1974; food shortages; uncertainty regarding the succession; border wars; and discontent in the middle class created through modernization. The high gasoline prices motivated taxi drivers and teachers to go on strike on 18 February 1974, and students and workers in Addis Ababa began demonstrating against the government on 20 February 1974. The feudal oligarchical cabinet of Akilou Habte Wolde was toppled, and a new government was formed with Endelkachew Makonnen serving as Prime Minister.\n\n\n=== Communist era (1974\u20131991) ===\n\nHaile Selassie's rule ended on 12 September 1974, when he was deposed by the Derg, a Soviet-backed Marxist\u2013Leninist military dictatorship led by Mengistu Haile Mariam. The new Provisional Military Administrative Council established a one-party communist state in March 1975.The ensuing government suffered several coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and a huge refugee problem. In 1977, Somalia, which had previously been receiving assistance and arms from the USSR, invaded Ethiopia in the Ogaden War, capturing part of the Ogaden region. Ethiopia recovered it after it began receiving massive military aid from the USSR, Cuba, South Yemen, East Germany, and North Korea. This included around 15,000 Cuban combat troops.In 1977\u201378, up to 500,000 were killed as a result of the Red Terror, from forced deportations or from the use of hunger as a weapon under Mengistu's rule. The Red Terror was carried out in response to what the Derg termed the 'White Terror', a chain of violent events, assassinations, and killings carried out by what it called \"petty bourgeois reactionaries\" who desired a reversal of the 1974 revolution.\n\nThe 1983\u201385 famine in Ethiopia affected around eight million people, resulting in one million dead. Insurrections against Communist rule sprang up, particularly in the northern regions of Eritrea and Tigray. The Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements in 1989, to form the coalition known as the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).Concurrently, the Soviet Union began to retreat from building world communism under Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika policies, marking a dramatic reduction in aid to Ethiopia from Socialist Bloc countries. This resulted in more economic hardship and the collapse of the military in the face of determined onslaughts by guerrilla forces in the north. The collapse of Marxism\u2013Leninism in general, and in eastern Europe during the revolutions of 1989, coincided with the Soviet Union stopping aid to Ethiopia altogether in 1990. The strategic outlook for Mengistu quickly deteriorated.EPRDF forces advanced on Addis Ababa in May 1991, and the Soviet Union did not intervene to save the government side. Mengistu fled the country and was granted asylum in Zimbabwe, where he still resides.In 2006, after a trial that lasted 12 years, Ethiopia's Federal High Court in Addis Ababa found Mengistu guilty of genocide in absentia. Numerous other top leaders of his government were also found guilty of war crimes. Mengistu and others who had fled the country were tried and sentenced in absentia. Numerous former officials received the death sentence and tens of others spent the next 20 years in jail, before being pardoned from life sentences.In July 1991, EPRDF convened a National Conference to establish the Transitional Government of Ethiopia composed of an 87-member Council of Representatives and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution. In June 1992, the Oromo Liberation Front withdrew from the government; in March 1993, members of the Southern Ethiopia Peoples' Democratic Coalition also left the government. In 1994, a new constitution was written that established a parliamentary republic with a bicameral legislature and a judicial system.\n\n\n=== Federal Democratic Republic (1991\u2013present) ===\n\nThe first multiparty election took place in May 1995, which was won by the EPRDF. The president of the transitional government, EPRDF leader Meles Zenawi, became the first Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and Negasso Gidada was elected its president.In May 1998, a border dispute with Eritrea led to the Eritrean\u2013Ethiopian War, which lasted until June 2000 and cost both countries an estimated $1 million a day. This had a negative effect on Ethiopia's economy, but strengthened the ruling coalition.Ethiopia's 3rd multiparty election on 15 May 2005 was highly disputed, with some opposition groups claiming fraud. Though the Carter Center approved the pre-election conditions, it expressed its dissatisfaction with post-election events. European Union election observers cited state support for the EPRDF campaign, as well as irregularities in ballot counting and results publishing. The opposition parties gained more than 200 parliamentary seats, compared with just 12 in the 2000 elections. While most of the opposition representatives joined the parliament, some leaders of the CUD party who refused to take up their parliamentary seats were accused of inciting the post-election violence and were imprisoned. Amnesty International considered them \"prisoners of conscience\" and they were subsequently released.A coalition of opposition parties and some individuals was established in 2009 to oust the government of the EPRDF in legislative elections of 2010. Meles' party, which has been in power since 1991, published its 65-page manifesto in Addis Ababa on 10 October 2009. The opposition won most votes in Addis Ababa, but the EPRDF halted counting of votes for several days. After it ensued, it claimed the election, amidst charges of fraud and intimidation.\n\nSome of the eight member parties of the Medrek (Forum for Democratic Dialogue) include the Oromo Federalist Congress (organized by the Oromo Federalist Democratic Movement and the Oromo People's Congress), the Arena Tigray (organized by former members of the ruling party TPLF), the Unity for Democracy and Justice (UDJ, whose leader is imprisoned), and the Coalition of Somali Democratic Forces.In mid-2011, two consecutively missed rainy seasons precipitated the worst drought in East Africa seen in 60 years. Full recovery from the drought's effects did not occur until 2012, with long-term strategies by the national government in conjunction with development agencies believed to offer the most sustainable results.\n\nMeles died on 20 August 2012 in Brussels, where he was being treated for an unspecified illness. Deputy Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn was appointed as a new prime minister until the 2015 elections, and remained so afterwards with his party in control of every parliamentary seat.Protests broke out across the country on 5 August 2016 and dozens of protesters were subsequently shot and killed by police. The protesters demanded an end to human rights abuses, the release of political prisoners, a fairer redistribution of the wealth generated by over a decade of economic growth, and a return of Wolqayt District to the Amhara Region. The events were the most violent crackdown against protesters in Sub-Saharan Africa since the Ethiopian government killed at least 75 people during protests in the Oromia Region in November and December 2015. Following these protests, Ethiopia declared a state of emergency on 6 October 2016. The state of emergency was lifted in August 2017.On 16 February 2018, the government of Ethiopia declared a six-month nationwide state of emergency following the resignation of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. Hailemariam is the first ruler in modern Ethiopian history to step down; previous leaders have died in office or been overthrown. He said he wanted to clear the way for reforms.\n\n\n=== Government reforms (2018\u2013present) ===\nThe new Prime Minister was Abiy Ahmed, who made a historic visit to Eritrea in 2018, ending the state of conflict between the countries. For his efforts in ending the 20-year-long war between Ethiopia and Eritrea Abiy Ahmed was awarded with the Nobel prize for peace in 2019. Since taking office in April 2018, 42-year-old Abiy has also released political prisoners, promised fair elections for 2019 and announced sweeping economic reforms. As of 6 June 2019, all the previously censored websites were made accessible again, over a thousand political prisoners were released and hundreds of administrative staff were fired as part of the reforms.Ethnic violence rose with the political unrest. There were Oromo\u2013Somali clashes between the Oromo, who make up the largest ethnic group in the country, and the ethnic Somalis, leading to up to 400,000 have been displaced in 2017. Gedeo\u2013Oromo clashes between the Oromo and the Gedeo people in the south of the country led to Ethiopia having the largest number of people to flee their homes in the world in 2018, with 1.4 million newly displaced people. In September 2018 in the minorities protest that took place in Oromo near the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, 23 people were killed. Some have blamed the rise in ethnic violence by the Oromo on the new Oromo Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for giving space to groups formerly banned by previous Tigrayan-led governments, such as the Oromo Liberation Front. Oromo-led protests broke out across Ethiopia following the assassination of musician Hachalu Hundessa on 29 June 2020, leading to the deaths of at least 200 people.The dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam has escalated in 2020. Egypt has opposed the dam, fearing that it will reduce the amount of water it receives from the Nile. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed warned that \"No force can stop Ethiopia from building a dam. If there is need to go to war, we could get millions readied.\"\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Ethiopia takes place in a framework of a federal parliamentary republic, wherein the Prime Minister is the head of government.\nThe President is the head of state but with largely ceremonial powers. Executive power is exercised by the government. Federal legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament. On the basis of Article 78 of the 1994 Ethiopian Constitution, the Judiciary is completely independent of the executive and the legislature. In 2015, the realities of this provision were questioned in a report prepared by Freedom House.\n\nAccording to the Democracy Index published by the United Kingdom-based Economist Intelligence Unit in late 2010, Ethiopia was an \"authoritarian regime\", ranking as the 118th-most democratic out of 167 countries. Ethiopia had dropped 12 places on the list since 2006, and the 2010 report attributed the drop to the government's crackdown on opposition activities, media and civil society before the 2010 parliamentary election, which the report argued had made Ethiopia a de facto one-party state.\nHowever, since the appointment of Abiy Ahmed as prime minister in 2018, the situation has rapidly evolved.In July 2015, during a trip that then-U.S. President Barack Obama took to Ethiopia, he highlighted the role of the country in the fight against Islamic terrorism. Obama was the first sitting United States president to visit Ethiopia.\n\n\n=== Governance ===\n\nThe election of Ethiopia's 547-member constituent assembly was held in June 1994. This assembly adopted the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in December 1994. The elections for Ethiopia's first popularly chosen national parliament and regional legislatures were held in May and June 1995. Most opposition parties chose to boycott these elections. There was a landslide victory for the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). International and non-governmental observers concluded that opposition parties would have been able to participate had they chosen to do so. The current government of Ethiopia was installed in August 1995. The first President was Negasso Gidada. The EPRDF-led government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi promoted a policy of ethnic federalism, devolving significant powers to regional, ethnically based authorities. Ethiopia today has ten semi-autonomous administrative regions that have the power to raise and spend their own revenues. Under the present government, some fundamental freedoms, including freedom of the press, are circumscribed.Citizens have little access to media other than the state-owned networks, and most private newspapers struggle to remain open and suffer periodic harassment from the government. Since the 2005 elections, at least 18 journalists who had written articles critical of the government, were arrested on genocide and treason charges. The government uses press laws governing libel to intimidate journalists who are critical of its policies.Meles' government was elected in 2000 in Ethiopia's first-ever multiparty elections; however, the results were heavily criticized by international observers and denounced by the opposition as fraudulent. The EPRDF also won the 2005 election returning Meles to power. Although the opposition vote increased in the election, both the opposition and observers from the European Union and elsewhere stated that the vote did not meet international standards for fair and free elections. Ethiopian police are said to have massacred 193 protesters, mostly in the capital Addis Ababa, in the violence following the May 2005 elections in the Ethiopian police massacre.\n\nThe government initiated a crackdown in the provinces as well; in Oromia state the authorities used concerns over insurgency and terrorism to use torture, imprisonment, and other repressive methods to silence critics following the election, particularly people sympathetic to the registered opposition party Oromo National Congress (ONC). The government has been engaged in a conflict with rebels in the Ogaden region since 2007. The biggest opposition party in 2005 was the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD). After various internal divisions, most of the CUD party leaders have established the new Unity for Democracy and Justice party led by Judge Birtukan Mideksa. A member of the country's Oromo ethnic group, Ms. Birtukan Mideksa is the first woman to lead a political party in Ethiopia.\nIn 2008, the top five opposition parties were the Unity for Democracy and Justice led by Judge Birtukan Mideksa, United Ethiopian Democratic Forces led by Dr. Beyene Petros, Oromo Federalist Democratic Movement led by Dr. Bulcha Demeksa, Oromo People's Congress led by Dr. Merera Gudina, and United Ethiopian Democratic Party \u2013 Medhin Party led by Lidetu Ayalew.  After the 2015 elections, Ethiopia lost its single remaining opposition MP; there are now no opposition MPs in the Ethiopian parliament.\n\n\n=== Human rights ===\n\nRecent human rights violations include the killing of 100 peaceful protestors by direct government gunfire in the Oromo and Amhara regions in 2016. The UN has called for UN observers on the ground in Ethiopia to investigate this incident, however the EPRDF-dominated Ethiopian government has refused this call. The protestors are protesting land grabs and lack of basic human rights such as the freedom to elect their representatives. The TPLF-dominated EPRDF won 100% in an election marked by fraud which has resulted in Ethiopian civilians protesting on scale unseen in prior post-election protests.Merera Gudina, leader of the Oromo People's Congress, said the East African country was at a \"crossroads\". \"People are demanding their rights,\" he said. \"People are fed up with what the regime has been doing for a quarter of a century. They're protesting against land grabs, reparations, stolen elections, the rising cost of living, many things. \"If the government continue to repress while the people are demanding their rights in the millions that (civil war) is one of the likely scenarios,\" Merera said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nAccording to surveys in 2003 by the National Committee on Traditional Practices in Ethiopia, marriage by abduction accounts for 69% of the nation's marriages, with around 80% in the largest region, Oromiya, and as high as 92% in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region. Homosexual acts are illegal in Ethiopia. Journalists and activists have been threatened or arrested for their coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia.Among the Omotic Karo-speaking and Hamer peoples in southern Ethiopia, adults and children with physical abnormalities are considered to be mingi, \"ritually impure\". The latter are believed to exert an evil influence upon others; disabled infants have traditionally been murdered without a proper burial. The Karo officially banned the practice in July 2012.In 2013, the Oakland Institute released a report accusing the Ethiopian government of forcing the relocation of \"hundreds of thousands of indigenous people from their lands\" in the Gambela Region The report describes the Ethiopian government's \"plans to move over 1.5 million people\" by the end of 2013, in order to allow foreign investors to develop the land for large scale industrial agriculture. According to several reports by the organization, those who refused were the subject of a variety of intimidation techniques including physical and sexual abuse, which sometimes led to deaths. A similar 2012 report by Human Rights Watch also describes the Ethiopian government's 2010\u20132011 villagization program in Gambella, with plans to carry out similar resettlements in other regions. The Ethiopian government has denied the accusations of land grabbing and instead pointed to the positive trajectory of the countries economy as evidence of the development program's benefits.\nMap of the Regions of Ethiopia; each is based on ethnicity and language, rather than physical geography or history.\nDespite a wide range of support from all over the world, and even winning Nobel peace prize for 2019, Prim minister Abiy Ahmed has failed to deliver the peace and integrity he promised in the highly divided nation. A nationwide series of violent protests, concentrated in the Oromia Region, broke out starting on 23 October 2019, sparked by activist and media owner Jawar Mohammed's allegation that security forces had attempted to detain him. According to official reports, 86 people were killed, mostly by mobs targeting ethnic and religious minorities within the region and surrounding areas, including Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, and the Harari Region.On 29 May 2020, Amnesty International released a report accusing the security forces of Ethiopia of mass detentions and extrajudicial killings. The report stated that in 2019, at least 25 people, suspected of supporting the Oromo Liberation Army, were killed by the forces in parts the Oromia Region. Besides, between January and September 2019, at least 10,000 people were detained under suspicion, where most were \u201csubjected to brutal beatings\u201d.\n\n\n== Military ==\n\nSince 1996, landlocked Ethiopia has had no navy and the army is relatively small with about 170,000 volunteers on active duty. In 2018 Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on state TV: \"We built one of the strongest ground and air force in Africa ... we should build our naval force capacity in the future.\"\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nBefore 1996, Ethiopia was divided into thirteen provinces, many derived from historical regions. The nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a federal government overseeing ethnically based regional states, zones, districts (woreda), and kebeles (\"neighbourhoods\").\nEthiopia is divided into ten ethnically based and politically autonomous regional states (kililoch, singular kilil\u2009) and two chartered cities (astedader akababiwoch, singular astedader akababi\u2009), the latter being Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa. The kililoch are subdivided into sixty-eight zones, and then further into 550 woredas and several special woredas.\nThe constitution assigns extensive power to regional states, which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal government's constitution. Each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions.\nArticle 39 of the Ethiopian Constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from Ethiopia. There is debate, however, as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states. The councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus. Such elaborate structure of council, executive, and sectoral public institutions is replicated to the next level (woreda).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAt 1,104,300 square kilometres (426,372.61 sq mi), Ethiopia is the world's 28th-largest country, comparable in size to Bolivia. It lies between the 3rd parallel north and the 15th parallel north and longitudes 33rd meridian east and 48th meridian east.\nThe major portion of Ethiopia lies in the Horn of Africa, which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. The territories that have frontiers with Ethiopia are Eritrea to the north and then, moving in a clockwise direction, Djibouti, the de facto state of Somaliland, Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the Great Rift Valley, which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, steppes, or semi-desert. There is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation and settlement patterns.\nEthiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive Afromontane in the northern and southwestern parts. Lake Tana in the north is the source of the Blue Nile. It also has many endemic species, notably the gelada, the walia ibex and the Ethiopian wolf (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The Ethiopian Highlands cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around 2,000\u20132,500 m (6,562\u20138,202 ft) above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.\n\nThe modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of Mount Entoto at an elevation of around 2,400 metres (7,900 ft). It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately 1,200 millimetres (47 in).\nThere are on average seven hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is 16 \u00b0C (60.8 \u00b0F), with daily maximum temperatures averaging 20\u201325 \u00b0C (68.0\u201377.0 \u00b0F) throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging 5\u201310 \u00b0C (41.0\u201350.0 \u00b0F).\nMost major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier. Dallol, in the Danakil Depression in this eastern zone, has the world's highest average annual temperature of 34 \u00b0C (93.2 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n\nEthiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals. The African wild dog prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory. However, with last sightings at Finicha'a, this canid is thought to be potentially locally extinct. The Ethiopian wolf is perhaps the most researched of all the endangered species within Ethiopia.\nEthiopia is a global center of avian diversity. To date more than 856 bird species have been recorded in Ethiopia, twenty of which are endemic to the country. Sixteen species are endangered or critically endangered. Many of these birds feed on butterflies, like the Bicyclus anynana.\n\nHistorically, throughout the African continent, wildlife populations have been rapidly declining due to logging, civil wars, pollution, poaching, and other human factors. A 17-year-long civil war, along with severe drought, negatively affected Ethiopia's environmental conditions, leading to even greater habitat degradation. Habitat destruction is a factor that leads to endangerment. When changes to a habitat occur rapidly, animals do not have time to adjust. Human impact threatens many species, with greater threats expected as a result of climate change induced by greenhouse gases. With carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 of 6,494,000 tonnes, Ethiopia contributes just 0.02% to the annual human-caused release of greenhouse gases.Ethiopia has many species listed as critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable to global extinction. The threatened species in Ethiopia can be broken down into three categories (based on IUCN ratings): critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable.\n\n\n=== Deforestation ===\n\nEthiopia is one of the eight fundamental and independent centers of origin for cultivated plants in the world. However, deforestation is a major concern for Ethiopia as studies suggest loss of forest contributes to soil erosion, loss of nutrients in the soil, loss of animal habitats, and reduction in biodiversity. At the beginning of the 20th century, around 420,000 km2 (or 35%) of Ethiopia's land was covered by trees, but recent research indicates that forest cover is now approximately 11.9% of the area.Ethiopia loses an estimated 1,410 km2 of natural forests each year. Between 1990 and 2005 the country lost approximately 21,000 km2 of forests. Current government programs to control deforestation consist of education, promoting reforestation programs, and providing raw materials which are alternatives to timber. In rural areas the government also provides non-timber fuel sources and access to non-forested land to promote agriculture without destroying forest habitat. Organizations such as SOS and Farm Africa are working with the federal government and local governments to create a system of forest management. Working with a grant of approximately 2.3 million Euros, the Ethiopian government recently began training people on reducing erosion and using proper irrigation techniques that do not contribute to deforestation. This project is assisting more than 80 communities.\n\n\n=== Protection ===\n\nSince April 2019, Ethiopian prime minister, Abiy Ahmed has promoted Beautifying Sheger, a development project that aims to reduce the negative effects of climate change \u2013 among other things \u2013 in the capital city of Addis Ababa. In the following May, the government held \"Dine for Sheger\", a fundraising event in order to cover some of the $1 billion needed through the public. $25 million was raised through the expensive event, both through the cost of attending and donation. Two Chinese railway companies under the Belt and Road Initiative between China and Ethiopia had supplied funds to develop 12 of the total 56 kilometres.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAccording to the IMF, Ethiopia was one of the fastest growing economies in the world, registering over 10% economic growth from 2004 through 2009. It was the fastest-growing non-oil-dependent African economy in the years 2007 and 2008. In 2015, the World Bank highlighted that Ethiopia had witnessed rapid economic growth with real domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 10.9% between 2004 and 2014.In 2008 and 2011, Ethiopia's growth performance and considerable development gains were challenged by high inflation and a difficult balance of payments situation. Inflation surged to 40% in August 2011 because of loose monetary policy, large civil service wage increase in early 2011, and high food prices. For 2011/12, end-year inflation was projected to be about 22%, and single digit inflation is projected in 2012/13 with the implementation of tight monetary and fiscal policies.\n\nIn spite of fast growth in recent years, GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and the economy faces a number of serious structural problems. However, with a focused investment in public infrastructure and industrial parks, Ethiopia's economy is addressing its structural problems to become a hub for light manufacturing in Africa. In 2019 a law was passed allowing expatriate Ethiopians to invest in Ethiopia's financial service industry.The Ethiopian constitution defines the right to own land as belonging only to \"the state and the people\", but citizens may lease land (up to 99 years), and are unable to mortgage or sell. Renting of land for a maximum of twenty years is allowed and this is expected to ensure that land goes to the most productive user. Land distribution and administration is considered an area where corruption is institutionalized, and facilitation payments as well as bribes are often demanded when dealing with land-related issues. As there is no land ownership, infrastructural projects are most often simply done without asking the land users, which then end up being displaced and without home or land. A lot of anger and distrust sometimes results in public protests. In addition, agricultural productivity remains low, and frequent droughts still beset the country, also leading to internal displacement.\n\n\n=== Energy and hydropower ===\n\nEthiopia has 14 major rivers flowing from its highlands, including the Nile. It has the largest water reserves in Africa. As of 2012, hydroelectric plants represented around 88.2% of the total installed electricity generating capacity.\nThe remaining electrical power was generated from fossil fuels (8.3%) and renewable sources (3.6%).\nThe electrification rate for the total population in 2016 was 42%, with 85% coverage in urban areas and 26% coverage in rural areas. As of 2016, total electricity production was 11.15 TW\u22c5h and consumption was 9.062 TW\u22c5h. There were 0.166 TW\u22c5h of electricity exported, 0 kW\u22c5h imported, and 2.784 GW of installed generating capacity.Ethiopia delivers roughly 81% of water volume to the Nile through the river basins of the Blue Nile, Sobat River and Atbara. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a bilateral treaty, the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement, which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt has discouraged almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to utilize the local Nile tributaries. This had the effect of discouraging external financing of hydropower and irrigation projects in western Ethiopia, thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects. However, Ethiopia is in the process of constructing a large 6,450 MW hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile river. When completed, this Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power station in Africa.The Gibe III hydroelectric project is so far the largest in the country with an installed capacity of 1,870 MW. For the year 2017\u201318 (2010 E.C) this hydro electric dam generated 4,900 GW\u22c5h.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nAgriculture constitutes around 85% of the labour force. However, the service sector represents the largest portion of the GDP. Many other economic activities depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly by small-scale farmers and enterprises, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include coffee, legumes, oilseeds, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables. Ethiopia is also a Vavilov center of diversity for domesticated crops, including enset, coffee and teff.\nExports are almost entirely agricultural commodities (with the exception of Gold exports), and coffee is the largest foreign exchange earner. Ethiopia is Africa's second biggest maize producer. According to UN estimations the per capita GDP of Ethiopia has reached $357 as of 2011.\n\n\n=== Exports ===\n\nExports from Ethiopia in the 2009/2010 financial year totaled US$1.4 billion. The country produces more coffee than any other nation on the continent.\"Coffee provides a livelihood for close to 15 million Ethiopians, 16% of the population. Farmers in the eastern part of the country, where a warming climate is already impacting production, have struggled in recent years, and many are currently reporting largely failed harvests as a result of a prolonged drought\".\n\nEthiopia also has the 5th largest inventory of cattle. Other main export commodities are khat, gold, leather products, and oilseeds. Recent development of the floriculture sector means Ethiopia is poised to become one of the top flower and plant exporters in the world.Cross-border trade by pastoralists is often informal and beyond state control and regulation. In East Africa, over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels. The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep, and goats from Ethiopia sold to Somalia, Djibouti, and Kenya generates an estimated total value of between 250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure).This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions, and promote regional integration. However, the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues. Recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade.\n\nWith the private sector growing slowly, designer leather products like bags are becoming a big export business, with Taytu becoming the first luxury designer label in the country. Additional small-scale export products include cereals, pulses, cotton, sugarcane, potatoes, and hides. With the construction of various new dams and growing hydroelectric power projects around the country, Ethiopia also plans to export electric power to its neighbors.Most regard Ethiopia's large water resources and potential as its \"white oil\" and its coffee resources as \"black gold\".The country also has large mineral resources and oil potential in some of the less inhabited regions. Political instability in those regions, however, has inhibited development. Ethiopian geologists were implicated in a major gold swindle in 2008. Four chemists and geologists from the Ethiopian Geological Survey were arrested in connection with a fake gold scandal, following complaints from buyers in South Africa. Gold bars from the National Bank of Ethiopia were found by police to be gilded metal, costing the state around US$17 million, according to the Science and Development Network website.In 2011, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam project was commenced. When completed, it will provide surplus energy in Ethiopia which will be available for export to neighboring countries.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nEthiopia has 926 km of electrified 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1\u20442 in) standard gauge railways, 656 km for the Addis Ababa\u2013Djibouti Railway between Addis Ababa and the Port of Djibouti (via Awash) and 270 km for the Awash\u2013Hara Gebeya Railway between Addis Ababa and the twin cities of Dessie/Kombolcha (also via Awash). Both railways are either in trial service or still under construction as of August 2017. Once commissioned and fully operational in 2018/2019, both railways will allow passenger transport with a designated speed of 120 km/hour and freight transport with a speed of ~80 km/hour. Expected travel time from Addis Ababa to Djibouti City for passengers would be less than twelve hours and travel time from Addis Ababa to Dessie/Kombolcha would be around six hours.\nBeyond the first 270 km of the Awash\u2013Hara Gebeya Railway, a second construction phase over 120 km foresees the extension of this railway from Dessie/Kombolcha to Hara Gebeya/Woldiya. It is not clear, when this section will be built and opened. A third, northern 216 km long railway is also under construction between Mek'ele and Woldiya, but it is also not clear, when this railway will be commissioned and opened. All railways are part of a future railway network of more than 5,000 km of railways, the National Railway Network of Ethiopia.\n\nAs the first part of a ten-year Road Sector Development Program, between 1997 and 2002 the Ethiopian government began a sustained effort to improve its infrastructure of roads. As a result, as of 2015 Ethiopia has a total (Federal and Regional) of 100,000 km of roads, both paved and gravel.Ethiopia had 58 airports as of 2012, and 61 as of 2016. Among these, the Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa and the Aba Tenna Dejazmach Yilma International Airport in Dire Dawa accommodate international flights. Ethiopian Airlines is the country's flag carrier, and is wholly owned by the Government of Ethiopia. From its hub at the Bole International Airport, the airline serves a network of 102 international passenger, 20 domestic passenger, and 44 cargo destinations. It is also one of the fastest-growing carriers in the industry and continent.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nEthiopia's total population has grown from 38.1 million in 1983 to 109.5 million in 2018. The population was only about nine million in the 19th century. The 2007 Population and Housing Census results show that the population of Ethiopia grew at an average annual rate of 2.6% between 1994 and 2007, down from 2.8% during the period 1983\u20131994. Currently, the population growth rate is among the top ten countries in the world. The population is forecast to grow to over 210 million by 2060, which would be an increase from 2011 estimates by a factor of about 2.5. According to UN estimations, life expectancy had improved substantially in recent years with male life expectancy reported to be 56 years and for women 60 years.\nThe country's population is highly diverse, containing over 80 different ethnic groups. According to the Ethiopian national census of 2007, the Oromo are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, at 34.4% of the nation's population. The Amhara represent 27.0% of the country's inhabitants, while Somalis and Tigrayans represent 6.2% and 6.1% of the population, respectively. Other prominent ethnic groups are as follows: Sidama 4.0%, Gurage 2.5%, Welayta 2.3%, Afar 1.7%, Hadiya 1.7%, Gamo 1.5% and Arabs and others 12.6%.Afroasiatic-speaking communities make up the majority of the population. Among these, Semitic speakers often collectively refer to themselves as the Habesha people. The Arabic form of this term (al-\u1e24abasha) is the etymological basis of \"Abyssinia,\" the former name of Ethiopia in English and other European languages. Additionally, Nilo-Saharan-speaking ethnic minorities inhabit the southern regions of the country, particularly in areas of the Gambela Region which borders South Sudan. The largest ethnic groups among these include the Nuer and Anuak.\nIn addition, Ethiopia had over 75,000 Italian settlers during the Italian occupation of the country. After independence, many Italians remained for decades after receiving full pardons from Emperor Selassie, as he saw the opportunity to continue modernization efforts. However, due to the Ethiopian Civil War in 1974, nearly 22,000 Italo-Ethiopians left the country. In the 2000s, some Italian companies returned to operate in Ethiopia, and many Italian technicians and managers arrived with their families, residing mainly in the metropolitan area of the capital.In 2009, Ethiopia hosted a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 135,200. The majority of this population came from Somalia (approximately 64,300 persons), Eritrea (41,700) and Sudan (25,900). The Ethiopian government required nearly all refugees to live in refugee camps.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, there are 90 individual languages spoken in Ethiopia. Most people in the country speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches. The former includes Oromo language, spoken by the Oromo, and Somali, spoken by the Somalis; the latter includes Amharic, spoken by the Amhara, and Tigrinya, spoken by the Tigrayans. Together, these four groups make up about three-quarters of Ethiopia's population. Other Afroasiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Sidamo, Afar, Hadiyya and Agaw languages, as well as the Semitic Gurage languages, Harari, Silt'e, and Argobba languages. Arabic, which also belongs to the Afroasiatic family, is likewise spoken in some areas.Additionally, Omotic languages are spoken by Omotic ethnic minority groups inhabiting the southern regions. Among these idioms are Aari, Bench, Dime, Dizin, Gamo-Gofa-Dawro, Maale, Hamer, and Wolaytta.Languages from the Nilo-Saharan family are also spoken by ethnic minorities concentrated in the southwestern parts of the country. These languages include Nuer, Anuak, Nyangatom, Majang, Suri, Me'en, and Mursi.English is the most widely spoken foreign language, and is the medium of instruction in secondary schools. Amharic was the language of primary school instruction, but has been replaced in many areas by regional languages such as Oromiffa, Somali or Tigrinya. While all languages enjoy equal state recognition in the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia and Oromo is the most widely spoken language, Amharic is recognized as the official working language of the Federal Government.The various regions of Ethiopia and chartered cities are free to determine their own working languages. Amharic is recognised as the official working language of Amhara Region, Benishangul-Gumuz, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, Gambela Region, Addis Abeba and Dire Dawa. Oromo language serves as the official working language and the primary language of education in the Oromia, Harar and Dire Dawa and of the Oromia Zone in the Amhara Region. Somali is the official working language of Somali region and Dire Dawa, while Afar, Harari, and Tigrinya are recognized as official working languages in their respective regions.\nItalian is still spoken by few parts of the population, mostly among older generations, and is taught in many schools (most notably the Istituto Statale Italiano Omnicomprensivo di Addis Abeba). Also, Amharic and Tigrinya have many words borrowed from the Italian language.\n\n\n=== Script ===\nEthiopia's principal orthography is the Ge'ez script. Employed as an abugida for several of the country's languages, it first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries BC as an abjad to transcribe the Semitic Ge'ez language. Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of both the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches. During the 1980s, the Ethiopic character set was computerized. It is today part of the Unicode standard as Ethiopic, Ethiopic Extended, Ethiopic Supplement and Ethiopic Extended-A.\nOther writing systems have also been used over the years by different Ethiopian communities. The latter include Bakri Sapalo's script for Oromiffa.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nEthiopia has close historical ties with all three of the world's major Abrahamic religions. In the 4th century, the Ethiopian empire was one of the first in the world to officially adopt Christianity as the state religion. As a result of the resolutions of the Council of Chalcedon, in 451 the miaphysites, which included the vast majority of Christians in Egypt and Ethiopia, were accused of monophysitism and designated as heretics under the common name of Coptic Christianity (see Oriental Orthodoxy). While no longer distinguished as a state religion, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church remains the majority Christian denomination. There is also a substantial Muslims demographic, representing around a third of the population. Additionally, Ethiopia is the site of the First Hegira, a major emigration in Islamic history. A town in the Tigray Region, Negash is the oldest Muslim settlement in Africa.\nUntil the 1980s, a substantial population of Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews) resided in Ethiopia. About 4,000 are estimated to still live in the country, along with many more members of two related ethno-religious groups, the Falash Mura and the Beta Abraham. The Falash Mura are Beta Israel who, while identifying as Jews, adopted elements of Christianity due to missionary efforts, and now practice a syncretic form of Ethiopian Judaism mixed with Christianity; they number about 150,000 people. The Beta Abraham are regarded as a medieval offshoot of the Beta Israel, having incorporated elements of traditional African religion, and number about 8,000. While both still identify as Beta Israel, they exist outside the main community. The official Beta Israel community leaders tentatively accept the Falash Mura, and have requested they be allowed to emigrate to Israel. The Beta Abraham have historically been shunned by most other communities, having a reputation of being \"sorcerers\".\n\n According to the 2007 National Census, Christians make up 62.8% of the country's population (43.5% Ethiopian Orthodox, 19.3% other denominations), Muslims 33.9%, practitioners of traditional faiths 2.6%, and other religions 0.6%. This is in agreement with the CIA World Factbook, which states that Christianity is the most widely practiced religion in Ethiopia. The ratio of the Christian to Muslim population has largely remained stable when compared to previous censuses conducted decades ago. Sunnis form the majority of Muslims with non-denominational Muslims being the second largest group of Muslims, and the Shia and Ahmadiyyas are a minority. Sunnis are largely Shafi'is or Salafis, and there are also many Sufi Muslims there. The large Muslim population in the northern Afar region has resulted in a Muslim separatist movement called the \"Islamic State of Afaria\" seeking a sharia-compliant constitution.Some critics asserted that the Haile Selassie regime had been fabricating the census to present Ethiopia as a Christian country to the outside world, stating that Islam made up 50% of the total population in 1991, based on the 1984 census commissioned by the Derg regime. Several Muslim observers and bloggers claim that Muslims are in the majority and disagree with the above census numbers, without providing factual data supporting their claims.The Kingdom of Aksum was one of the first polities to officially embrace Christianity, when Frumentius of Tyre, called Fremnatos or Abba Selama (\"Father of Peace\") in Ethiopia, converted Emperor Ezana during the fourth century. According to the New Testament, Christianity had entered Ethiopia even earlier, when an official in the Ethiopian royal treasury was baptized by Philip the Evangelist.\n\nThe Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is part of Oriental Orthodoxy. It is by far the largest Christian denomination, although a number of P'ent'ay (Protestant) churches have recently gained ground. Since 1930, a relatively small Ethiopian Catholic Church has existed in full communion with Rome, with adherents making up less than 1% of the total population.\n\nIslam in Ethiopia dates back to the founding of the religion in 622 when a group of Muslims were counseled by Muhammad to escape persecution in Mecca. The disciples subsequently migrated to Abyssinia via modern-day Eritrea, which was at the time ruled by Ashama ibn-Abjar, a pious Christian emperor. Also, the largest single ethnic group of non-Arab Sahabah was that of the Ethiopians.According to the 2007 Population and Housing Census, around 1,957,944 people in Ethiopia are adherents of traditional religions. An additional 471,861 residents practice other creeds. While followers of all religions can be found in each region, they tend to be concentrated in certain parts of the country. Christians predominantly live in the northern Amhara and Tigray regions, and are largely members of the non-Chalcedonian Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Those belonging to P'ent'ay are centered in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (SNNP) and Oromia. Muslims in Ethiopia predominantly adhere to Sunni Islam and generally inhabit eastern and northeastern areas; particularly the Somali, Afar, Dire Dawa and Harari regions. Practitioners of traditional religions mainly reside in the nation's far southwestern and western rural borderlands, in the SNNP, Benishangul-Gumuz and Gambela regions.Human rights groups have regularly accused the government of arresting activists, journalists and bloggers to stamp out dissent among some religious communities. Lengthy prison terms were handed to 17 Muslim activists on 3 August 2015 ranging from seven to 22 years. They were charged with trying to create an Islamic state in the majority Christian country. All the defendants denied the charges and claimed that they were merely protesting in defence of their rights.\n\n\n==== Beta Israel ====\n\nThere is a small, yet significant number of Jews in Ethiopia, who claim to be one of the lost tribes of Israel. In the 1980s, the number of Ethiopian-Jews decreased, as many started moving to Israel. The tribe has been given the name Beta Israel / \u1264\u1273 \u12a5\u1235\u122b\u12a4\u120d / \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05d0 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc. There are a higher number of Ethiopian-Jews living in Israel today, though, in certain Ethiopian towns and villages such as Wolleka, near the Ethiopian city of Gondar, the concentration of Ethiopian-Jews reaches an estimated 100%. The US also has a significant number of Ethiopian-Jews, with a population slightly less than that of Ethiopia.\n\n\n=== Urbanization ===\n\nPopulation growth, migration, and urbanization are all straining both governments' and ecosystems' capacity to provide people with basic services. Urbanization has steadily been increasing in Ethiopia, with two periods of significantly rapid growth. First, in 1936\u20131941 during the Italian occupation under Mussolini's fascist government, and from 1967 to 1975 when the populations of urban centers tripled.In 1936, Italy annexed Ethiopia, building infrastructure to connect major cities, and a dam providing power and water. This along with the influx of Italians and labourers was the major cause of rapid growth during this period. The second period of growth was from 1967 to 1975 when rural populations migrated to urban centers seeking work and better living conditions.This pattern slowed due to the 1975 Land Reform program instituted by the government, which provided incentives for people to stay in rural areas. As people moved from rural areas to the cities, there were fewer people to grow food for the population. The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 1970\u20131983. This program proliferated the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture. The act did lead to an increase in food production, although there is debate over the cause; it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform act. Urban populations have continued to grow with an 8.1% increase from 1975 to 2000.\n\n\n==== Rural and urban life ====\n\nMigration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives. In peasant associations daily life is a struggle to survive. About 16% of the population in Ethiopia are living on less than one dollar per day (2008). Only 65% of rural households in Ethiopia consume the World Health Organization's minimum standard of food per day (2,200 kilocalories), with 42% of children under 5 years old being underweight.Most poor families (75%) share their sleeping quarters with livestock, and 40% of children sleep on the floor, where nighttime temperatures average 5 degrees Celsius in the cold season. The average family size is six or seven, living in a 30-square-meter mud and thatch hut, with less than two hectares of land to cultivate.\n\nThe peasant associations face a cycle of poverty. Since the landholdings are so small, farmers cannot allow the land to lie fallow, which reduces soil fertility. This land degradation reduces the production of fodder for livestock, which causes low milk yields. Since the community burns livestock manure as fuel, rather than plowing the nutrients back into the land, the crop production is reduced. The low productivity of agriculture leads to inadequate incomes for farmers, hunger, malnutrition and disease. These unhealthy farmers have difficulty working the land and the productivity drops further.Although conditions are drastically better in cities, all of Ethiopia suffers from poverty and poor sanitation. However, poverty in Ethiopia fell from 44% to 29.6% during 2000\u20132011, according to the World Bank. In the capital city of Addis Ababa, 55% of the population used to live in slums. Now, however, a construction boom in both the private and the public sector has led to a dramatic improvement in living standards in major cities, particularly in Addis Ababa. Notably, government-built condominium housing complexes have sprung up throughout the city, benefiting close to 600,000 individuals. Sanitation is the most pressing need in the city, with most of the population lacking access to waste treatment facilities. This contributes to the spread of illness through unhealthy water.\n\nDespite the living conditions in the cities, the people of Addis Ababa are much better off than people living in the peasant associations owing to their educational opportunities. Unlike rural children, 69% of urban children are enrolled in primary school, and 35% of those are eligible to attend secondary school. Addis Ababa has its own university as well as many other secondary schools. The literacy rate is 82%.Many NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) are working to solve this problem; however, most are far apart, uncoordinated, and working in isolation. The Sub-Saharan Africa NGO Consortium is attempting to coordinate efforts.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe World Health Organization's 2006 World Health Report gives a figure of 1,936 physicians (for 2003), which comes to about 2.6 per 100,000. A brain drain associated with globalization is said to affect the country, with many educated professionals leaving Ethiopia for better economic opportunities in the West.\n\nEthiopia's main health problems are said to be communicable (contagious) diseases worsened by poor sanitation and malnutrition. Over 44 million people (nearly half the population) do not have access to clean water. These problems are exacerbated by the shortage of trained doctors and nurses and health facilities.The state of public health is considerably better in the cities. Birth rates, infant mortality rates, and death rates are lower in cities than in rural areas due to better access to education, medicines, and hospitals. Life expectancy is better in cities compared to rural areas, but there have been significant improvements witnessed throughout the country in recent years, the average Ethiopian living to be 62.2 years old, according to a UNDP report. Despite sanitation being a problem, use of improved water sources is also on the rise; 81% in cities compared to 11% in rural areas. As in other parts of Africa, there has been a steady migration of people towards the cities in hopes of better living conditions.\nThere are 119 hospitals (12 in Addis Ababa) and 412 health centers in Ethiopia. Infant mortality rates are relatively high, as 41 infants die per 1,000 live births. Ethiopia has been able to reduce under-five mortality by two-thirds (one of the Millennium Development Goals) since 1990. Although this is a dramatic decrease, birth-related complications such as obstetric fistula affect many of the nation's women.\n\nHIV/AIDS in Ethiopia stood at 1.1% in 2014, a dramatic decrease from 4.5% 15 years ago. The most affected are poor communities and women, due to lack of health education, empowerment, awareness and lack of social well-being. The government of Ethiopia and many international organizations like World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations, are launching campaigns and are working aggressively to improve Ethiopia's health conditions and promote health awareness on AIDS and other communicable diseases.Ethiopia has a relatively high infant and maternal mortality rate. Although, Ethiopia did not meet the MDG target of reducing maternal mortality rate by two thirds in 2015, there are improvements nonetheless. For instance, the contraception prevalence rate increased from 8.1% in 2000 to 41.8% in 2014, and Antenatal care service coverage increase from 29% to an astounding 98.1% in the same period. Currently, the maternal mortality rate stands at 420 per 100,000 live births. Only a minority of Ethiopians are born in hospitals, while most are born in rural households. Those who are expected to give birth at home have elderly women serve as midwives who assist with the delivery. The \"WHO estimates that a majority of maternal fatalities and disabilities could be prevented if deliveries were to take place at well-equipped health centers, with adequately trained staff\".\n\nThe low availability of health-care professionals with modern medical training, together with lack of funds for medical services, leads to the preponderance of less-reliable traditional healers that use home-based therapies to heal common ailments.\nOne common cultural practice, irrespective of religion or economic status, is female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), a procedure that involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The practice was made illegal in Ethiopia in 2004. FGM is a pre-marital custom mainly endemic to Northeast Africa and parts of the Near East that has its ultimate origins in Ancient Egypt. Encouraged by women in the community, it is primarily intended to deter promiscuity and to offer protection from assault.The country has a high prevalence of FGM, but prevalence is lower among young girls. Ethiopia's 2005 Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) noted that the national prevalence rate is 74% among women ages 15\u201349. The practice is almost universal in the regions of Dire Dawa, Somali, and Afar. In the Oromo and Harari regions, more than 80% of girls and women undergo the procedure. FGC is least prevalent in the regions of Tigray and Gambela, where 29% and 27% of girls and women, respectively, are affected. According to a 2010 study performed by the Population Reference Bureau, Ethiopia has a prevalence rate of 81% among women ages 35 to 39 and 62% among women ages 15\u201319. A 2014 UNICEF report found that only 24% of girls under 14 had undergone FGM.Male circumcision is also practiced in the country, and about 76% of Ethiopia's male population is reportedly circumcised.The Government of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia is signatory to various international conventions and treaties that protect the rights of women and children. Its constitution provides for the fundamental rights and freedoms for women. There is an attempt being made to raise the social and economic status of women through eliminating all legal and customary practices, which hinder women's equal participation in society and undermine their social status.\nThe National Mental Health Strategy, published in 2012, introduced the development of policy designed to improve mental health care in Ethiopia. This strategy mandated that mental health be integrated into the primary health care system. However, the success of the National Mental Health Strategy has been limited. For example, the burden of depression is estimated to have increased 34.2% from 2007 to 2017. Furthermore, the prevalence of stigmatizing attitudes, inadequate leadership and co-ordination of efforts, as well as a lack of mental health awareness in the general population, all remain as obstacles to successful mental health care.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nEducation in Ethiopia was dominated by the Tewahedo Church for many centuries until secular education was adopted in the early 1900s. The current system follows school expansion schemes which are very similar to the system in the rural areas during the 1980s, with an addition of deeper regionalization, providing rural education in students' own languages starting at the elementary level, and with more budget finances allocated to the education sector. The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, four years of lower secondary school and two years of higher secondary school.Access to education in Ethiopia has improved significantly. Approximately three million people were in primary school in 1994/95, and by 2008/09, primary enrolment had risen to 15.5 million \u2013 an increase of over 500%. In 2013/14, the country had witnessed significant boost in gross enrolment across all regions. The national GER was 104.8% for boys, 97.8% for girls and 101.3% across both sexes.The literacy rate has increased in recent years: according to the 1994 census, the literacy rate in Ethiopia was 23.4%. In 2007 it was estimated to be 39% (male 49.1% and female 28.9%). A report by UNDP in 2011 showed that the literacy rate in Ethiopia was 46.7%. The same report also indicated that the female literacy rate has increased from 27 to 39 percent from 2004 to 2011, and the male literacy rate has increased from 49 to 59 percent over the same period for persons 10 years and older. By 2015, the literacy rate had further increased, to 49.1% (57.2% male and 41.1% female).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Naming ===\n\nEthiopians have a different naming system to the family name-based Western system. Children add the given names of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family surname, and a person's given name and their father's given name form the first names.\nEveryone is addressed by their given name. In official situations, the prefixes Ato (\u12a0\u1276) is used for men; Weyzero (\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122e) for married women; and Weyzer\u012bt (\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122a\u1275) for unmarried women.\n\n\n=== Calendar ===\n\nEthiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the Ethiopian calendar, also known as the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or Coptic calendar, which in turn derives from the Egyptian calendar. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six epagomenal days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.\nLike the Julian calendar, the sixth epagomenal day\u2014which in essence is a leap day\u2014is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1 M\u00e4sk\u00e4r\u00e4m, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September (Gregorian), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. Also, a seven- to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the Annunciation of Jesus.\nAnother calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the Oromo. A lunar-stellar calendar, this Oromo calendar relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent), and Gurrandala (small crescent).\n\n\n=== Time ===\nTime in Ethiopia is counted differently from most countries. The Ethiopian day is reckoned as beginning at 06:00 as opposed to 00:00, coinciding with sunrise throughout the year. To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) six hours to the Western time. For example, 02:00 local Addis Ababa time is called \"8 at night\" in Ethiopia, while 20:00 is called \"2 in the evening\".\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe best-known Ethiopian cuisine consists of various types of thick meat stews, known as wat in Ethiopian culture, and vegetable side dishes served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread made of teff flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead one uses the injera to scoop up the entr\u00e9es and side dishes. Almost universally in Ethiopia, it is common to eat from the same dish in the center of the table with a group of people. It is also a common custom to feed others in your group with your own hands\u2014a tradition referred to as \"gursha\". Traditional Ethiopian cuisine employs no pork or shellfish of any kind, as they are forbidden in the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian, Islamic and Jewish faiths.\nChechebsa, marqa, chukko, michirra and dhanga are the most popular dishes from the Oromo. Kitfo, which originated among the Gurage, is one of the country's most popular delicacies. In addition, Doro wot (\u12f0\u122e \u12c8\u1325 in Amharic) and Tsebehi derho (\u133d\u1265\u1212 \u12f5\u122d\u1206 in Tigrinya), are other popular dishes, originating from northwestern Ethiopia. Tihlo (\u1325\u1215\u120e)\u2014which is a type of dumpling\u2014is prepared from roasted barley flour and originated in the Tigray Region. Tihlo is now very popular in Amhara and spreading further south.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nEthiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC), formerly known as ETV, is the government-owned national channel. Other television stations in the country include Kana TV.\nThe most widely circulated newspapers in Ethiopia are Addis Fortune, Capital Ethiopia, Ethiopian Reporter, Addis Zemen (Amharic) and Ethiopian Herald.\nThe sole internet service provider is the national telecommunications firm Ethio Telecom. A large portion of users in the country access the internet through mobile devices. As of July 2016, there are around 4.29 million people who have internet access at their home as compared to a quarter of a million users a decade before that. The Ethiopian government has at times intentionally shut down internet service in the country or restricted access to certain social media sites during periods of political unrest. In August 2016, following protest and demonstration in the Oromia Region, all access to the internet was shut down for a period of two days. In June 2017, the government shut down access to the internet for mobile users during a period that coincided with the administration of Ethiopia's university entrance examination. Although the reason for the restriction was not confirmed by the government, the move was similar to a measure taken during the same period in 2016, after a leak of test questions.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse, with each of the country's 80 ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds. Ethiopian music uses a distinct modal system that is pentatonic, with characteristically long intervals between some notes. As with many other aspects of Ethiopian culture and tradition, tastes in music and lyrics are strongly linked with those in neighboring Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti, and Sudan. Traditional singing in Ethiopia presents diverse styles of polyphony (heterophony, drone, imitation, and counterpoint). Traditionally, lyricism in Ethiopian song writing is strongly associated with views of patriotism or national pride, romance, friendship, and a most unique type of memoire known as 'Tizita'.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe main sports in Ethiopia are track and field (particularly long distance running) and football. Ethiopian athletes have won many Olympic gold medals in track and field, most of them in long distance running. Abebe Bikila became the first athlete from a sub Saharan country to win an Olympic Gold medal when he won the Marathon at the 1960 Rome Olympic Games in a world record time of 2:15:16.Haile Gebrselassie is a world-renowned long distance runner with several world records under his belt. Kenenisa Bekele and Tirunesh Dibaba are also dominant runners, particularly in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters in which they hold the world records.\nOther notable Ethiopian athletes are Mamo Wolde, Miruts Yifter, Derartu Tulu, Meseret Defar, Almaz Ayana, Birhane Adere, Tiki Gelana, Genzebe Dibaba, Tariku Bekele, and Gelete Burka. As of 2012 and going into 2013, the current national Ethiopian national football team (nicknamed the Walayia Antelopes) made history by qualifying for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations and reached the last 10 African football teams in the last stage of qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Noted players include captain Adane Girma and top scorer Saladin Said.\nEthiopia has sub-Saharan Africa's longest basketball tradition as it established a national basketball team in 1949.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Ethiopia-related articles\nOutline of Ethiopia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Ethiopia\".

        "wiki": "Addis Ababa (Amharic: \u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12a0\u1260\u1263, Addis Ab\u00e4ba IPA: [ad\u02c8dis \u02c8ab\u0259ba] (listen), \"new flower\") or Addis Abeba, also known as Finfinne (Oromo: Finfinne \"natural spring\"), is the capital and largest city of Ethiopia. According to the 2007 census, the city has a population of 2,739,551 inhabitants.As a chartered city, Addis Ababa also serves as the capital city of the Oromia Region. It is where the African Union is headquartered and where its predecessor the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was based. It also hosts the headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), as well as various other continental and international organizations. Addis Ababa is therefore often referred to as \"the political capital of Africa\" for its historical, diplomatic and political significance for the continent. The city lies a few miles west of the East African Rift which splits Ethiopia into two, through the Nubian Plate and the Somali Plate.The city is populated by people from different regions of Ethiopia. It is home to Addis Ababa University.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nEntoto is one of a handful of sites put forward as a possible location for a medieval imperial capital known as Barara. This permanent fortified city was established during the early-to-mid 15th century, and it served as the main residence of several successive emperors up to the early 16th-century reign of Lebna Dengel. The city was depicted standing between Mounts Zikwala and Menegasha on a map drawn by the Italian cartographer Fra Mauro in around 1450, and it was razed and plundered by Ahmed Gragn while the imperial army was trapped on the south of the Awash River in 1529, an event witnessed and documented two years later by the Yemeni writer Arab-Faqih. The suggestion that Barara was located on Mount Entoto is supported by the very recent discovery of a large medieval town overlooking Addis Ababa located between rock-hewn Washa Mikael and the more modern church of Entoto Maryam, founded in the late 19th century by Emperor Menelik. Dubbed the Pentagon, the 30-hectare site incorporates a castle with 12 towers, along with 520 meters of stone walls measuring up to 5-meter high.The site of Addis Ababa was chosen by Empress Taytu Betul and the city was founded in 1886 by Emperor Menelik II. Menelik, as initially a King of the Shewa province, had found Mount Entoto a useful base for military operations in the south of his realm, and in 1879 he visited the reputed ruins of a medieval town and an unfinished rock church that showed proof of the medieval empire's capital in the area before the campaigns of Ahmad ibn Ibrihim. His interest in the area grew when his wife Taytu began work on a church on Mount Entoto, and Menelik endowed a second church in the area.\n\nHowever, the immediate area did not encourage the founding of a town for lack of firewood and water, so settlement actually began in the valley south of the mountain in 1886. Initially, Taytu built a house for herself near the \"Filwoha\" hot mineral springs, where she and members of the Showan Royal Court liked to take mineral baths. Other nobility and their staff and households settled in the vicinity, and Menelik expanded his wife's house to become the Imperial Palace which remains the seat of government in Addis Ababa today. The name changed to Addis Ababa and became Ethiopia's capital when Menelik II became Emperor of Ethiopia. The town grew by leaps and bounds. One of Emperor Menelik's contributions that are still visible today is the planting of numerous eucalyptus trees along the city streets.\n\nFollowing all the major engagements of their invasion, Italian troops from the colony of Eritrea entered Addis Ababa on 5 May 1936. Along with Dire Dawa, the city had been spared the aerial bombardment (including the use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas) practiced elsewhere and its railway to Djibouti remained intact. After the occupation the city served as the Duke of Aosta's capital for unified Italian East Africa until 1941, when it was abandoned in favor of Amba Alagi and other redoubts during the Second World War's East African Campaign. The city was liberated by Major Orde Wingate and negus Haile Selassie for Ethiopian Gideon Force and Ethiopian resistance in time to permit Emperor Haile Selassie's return on 5 May 1941, five years to the day after he had left. Following reconstruction, Haile Selassie helped form the Organisation of African Unity in 1963 and invited the new organization to keep its headquarters in Addis Ababa. The OAU was dissolved in 2002 and replaced by the African Union (AU), which is also headquartered in the city. The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa also has its headquarters in Addis Ababa. Addis Ababa was also the site of the Council of the Oriental Orthodox Churches in 1965.\nEthiopia has often been called the original home of mankind because of various humanoid fossil discoveries like the Australopithecine Lucy. Northeastern Africa, and the Afar region in particular, was the central focus of these claims until recent DNA evidence suggested origins in south central Ethiopian regions like present-day Addis Ababa. After analysing the DNA of almost 1,000 people around the world, geneticists and other scientists claimed people spread from what is now Addis Ababa 100,000 years ago. The research indicated that genetic diversity decreases steadily the farther one's ancestors traveled from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAddis Ababa lies at an elevation of 2,355 metres (7,726 ft) and is a grassland biome, located at 9\u00b01\u203248\u2033N 38\u00b044\u203224\u2033E. The city lies at the foot of Mount Entoto and forms part of the watershed for the Awash. From its lowest point, around Bole International Airport, at 2,326 metres (7,631 ft) above sea level in the southern periphery, Addis Ababa rises to over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) in the Entoto Mountains to the north.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nThe city is divided into 10 boroughs, called subcities (Amharic: \u12ad\u134d\u1208 \u12a8\u1270\u121b, kifle ketema), and 99 wards (Amharic: \u1240\u1260\u120c, kebele). The 10 subcities are:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAddis Ababa has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cwb) with precipitation varying considerably by the month. The city has a complex mix of highland climate zones, with temperature differences of up to 10 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F), depending on elevation and prevailing wind patterns. The high elevation moderates temperatures year-round, and the city's position near the equator means that temperatures are very constant from month to month. As such the climate would be maritime if its elevation was not taken into account, as no month is above 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) in mean temperatures.\nMid-November to January is a season for occasional rain. The highland climate regions are characterized by dry winters, and this is the dry season in Addis Ababa. During this season the daily maximum temperatures are usually not more than 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F), and the night-time minimum temperatures can drop to freezing. The short rainy season is from February to May. During this period, the difference between the daytime maximum temperatures and the night-time minimum temperatures is not as great as during other times of the year, with minimum temperatures in the range of 10\u201315 \u00b0C (50\u201359 \u00b0F). At this time of the year, the city experiences warm temperatures and a pleasant rainfall. The long wet season is from June to mid-September; it is the major winter season of the country. This period coincides with summer, but the temperatures are much lower than at other times of year because of the frequent rain and hail and the abundance of cloud cover and fewer hours of sunshine. This time of the year is characterized by dark, chilly and wet days and nights. The autumn which follows is a transitional period between the wet and dry seasons.\nThe highest temperature on record was 30.6 \u00b0C (87.1 \u00b0F) 26 February 2019, while the lowest temperature on record was 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) recorded on multiple occasions.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the latest 2007 population census conducted by the Ethiopian national statistics authorities, Addis Ababa has a total population of 2,739,551 urban and rural inhabitants.

According to official statistics from the federal government, some 119,197 people in the city are engaged in trade and commerce; 113,977 in manufacturing and industry; 80,391 Homemakers of different variety; 71,186 in civil administration; 50,538 in transport and communication; 42,514 in education, health and social services; 32,685 in hotel and catering services; and 16,602 in agriculture.

It is a relatively clean and safe city, with the most common crimes being pickpocketing, scams and minor burglary. The city has recently been in a construction boom with tall buildings rising in many places. Various luxury services have also become available and the construction of shopping malls has recently increased. According to Tia Goldenberg of IOL, area spa professionals said that some people have labeled the city, \"the spa capital of Africa.\"Ethiopian Airlines has its headquarters on the grounds of Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourism is a growing industry within Addis Ababa and Ethiopia as a whole. The country has seen a 10% increase in tourism over the last decade, subsequently bringing an influx of tourists to Addis Ababa. In 2015, the European Council on Tourism and Trade named Ethiopia the Number One tourist spot in the world.\n\n\n== Zoo ==\n\nAddis Ababa Zoo kept 15 lions in 2011. Their hair samples were used in a genetic analysis, which revealed that they were genetically diverse. It was therefore proposed to include them in a captive breeding programme.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nPursuant to the Ethiopian Constitution of 1995, the city of Addis Ababa is one of the two federal cities that are accountable to the Federal Government of Ethiopia. The other city with the same status is Dire Dawa in the east of the country and both are federal cities. Earlier, following the establishment of the federal structure in 1991 under the Transitional Charter of Ethiopia, the City Government of Addis Ababa was one of the then new 14 regional governments. However, that structure was changed by the federal constitution in 1995 and as a result, Addis Ababa does not have statehood status.\nThe administration of Addis Ababa city consists of the Mayor, who leads the executive branch, and the City Council, which enacts city regulations. However, as part of the Federal Government, the federal legislature enacts laws that are binding in Addis Ababa. Members of the City Council are directly elected by the residents of the city and the Council, in turn, elects the Mayor among its members. The term of office for elected officials is five years. However, the Federal Government, when it deems necessary, can dissolve the City Council and the entire administration and replace it by a temporary administration until elections take place next. Residents of Addis Ababa are represented in the federal legislature, the House of Peoples' Representatives. However, the city is not represented in the House of Federation, which is the federal upper house constituted by the representatives of the member states. The executive branch under the Mayor comprises the City Manager and various branches of civil service offices.\nThe Mayor of Addis Ababa is Engineer Takele Uma Benti from the Oromo Democratic Party, ODP formerly Oromo People Democratic Organisation (OPDO), which is the member of the ruling coalition Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Engineer Takele Uma took office in 2018. His predecessor, Mr. Dirribaa Kumaa and Kumaa Dammaqsaa (also both from the ODP), were the city's mayor respectively before Takele. Before that, the Federal Government appointed Mr. Berhane Deressa to lead the temporary caretaker administration that served from 9 May 2006 to 30 October 2008 following the 2005 election crisis. In the 2005 national election, the ruling EPRDF party suffered a major defeat in Addis Ababa. However, the opposition who won in Addis Ababa did not take part in the government both on the regional and federal level. This situation forced the EPRDF-led Federal Government to assign a temporary administration until a new election was carried out. As a result, Mr. Berhane Deressa, an independent citizen, was appointed.\nSome of the notable past mayors of Addis Ababa are Arkebe Oqubay (2003\u201306), Zewde Teklu (1985\u201389), Alemu Abebe (1977\u201385) and Zewde Gebrehiwot (1960\u201369).\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nAddis Ababa is considered to be extremely safe in comparison to the other cities in the region. On a crime index, Addis Ababa scores a 44.28, putting it at a crime level of moderate. Pickpocketing and petty unarmed thefts are more common within the city. Corruption and bribery are extremely common crimes in Addis Ababa. Violent crimes are very unlikely to happen in the city.\n\n\n== Places of worship ==\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus (Lutheran World Federation), Ethiopian Kale Heywet Church, Ethiopian Catholic Archeparchy of Addis Abeba (Catholic Church), Ethiopian Full Gospel Believers' Church. There are also Muslim mosques.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nA financial district is under construction in Addis Ababa.Mayor Kuma Demeksa embarked on a quest to improve investment for the buildings in the city. Addis Ababa is the headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and the African Union.Notable taller architecture in Addis Ababa includes the Huda Tower, Nani Tower, Bank Misr Building, as well as the approved Angola World Trade Center Tower, Abyssinia Bank Tower, Mexico Square Tower, and the $200m AU Conference Center and Office Complex.Notable buildings include St George's Cathedral (founded in 1896 and also home to a museum), Holy Trinity Cathedral (once the largest Ethiopian Orthodox Cathedral and the location of Sylvia Pankhurst's tomb) as well as the burial place of Emperor Haile Selassie and the Imperial family, and those who fought the Italian invasion during World War II.\nIn the Merkato district, which is the largest open market in Africa, is the Grand Anwar Mosque, the biggest mosque in Ethiopia built during the Italian occupation. A few meters to the southwest of the Anwar Mosque is the Raguel Church built after the liberation by Empress Menen. The proximity of the mosque and the church has symbolized the long peaceful relations between Christianity and Islam in Ethiopia. The Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family is also in the Merkato district. Near Bole International Airport is the new Medhane Alem (Savior of the World) Orthodox Cathedral, which is the second largest in Africa.\nThe Entoto Mountains start among the northern suburbs. Suburbs of the city include Shiro Meda and Entoto in the north, Urael and Bole (home to Bole International Airport) in the east, Nifas Silk in the south-east, Mekanisa in the south, and Keraniyo and Kolfe in the west. Kolfe was mentioned in Nelson Mandela's Autobiography \"A Long Walk to Freedom\", as the place he got military training.\nAddis Ababa has a distinct architectural style. Unlike many African cities, Addis Ababa was not built as a colonial settlement. This means that the city has not a European style of architecture. This changed with the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936. The Piazza district in the city center is the most evident indicator of Italian influence. The buildings are very much Italian in style and there are many Italian restaurants, as well as small cafes, and European-style shopping centers.Parks include the Africa Park, which is situated along Menelik II Avenue.\nOther features of the city include the large Mercato market, the Jan Meda racecourse, Bihere Tsige Recreation Centre and a railway line to Djibouti.\nThe city is home to the Ethiopian National Library, the Ethiopian Ethnological Museum (and former Guenete Leul Palace), the Addis Ababa Museum, the Ethiopian Natural History Museum, the Ethiopian Railway Museum and National Postal Museum.\nThere is also Menelik's old Imperial palace which remains the official seat of government, and the National Palace formerly known as the Jubilee Palace (built to mark Emperor Haile Selassie's Silver Jubilee in 1955) which is the residence of the President of Ethiopia. Jubilee Palace was also modeled after Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom. Africa Hall is located across Menelik II avenue from this Palace and is where the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is headquartered as well as most UN offices in Ethiopia. It is also the site of the founding of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), which eventually became the African Union (AU). The African Union is now housed in a new headquarters built on the site of the demolished Akaki Prison, on land donated by Ethiopia for this purpose in the south western part of the city. The Hager Fikir Theatre, the oldest theater in Ethiopia, is located at the Piazza district. Near Holy Trinity Cathedral is the art deco Parliament building, built during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, with its clock tower. It continues to serve as the seat of Parliament today. Across from the Parliament is the Shengo Hall, built by the Derg regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam as its new parliament hall. The Shengo Hall was the world's largest pre-fabricated building, which was constructed in Finland before being assembled in Addis Ababa. It is used for large meetings and conventions. Itegue Taitu Hotel, built in 1898 (Ethiopian Calendar) in the middle of the city (Piazza), was the first hotel in Ethiopia.\nMeskel Square is one of the noted squares in the city and is the site for the annual Meskel at the end of September annually when thousands gather in celebration.\nThe fossilized skeleton, and a plaster replica of the early hominid Lucy (known in Ethiopia as Dinkinesh) is preserved at the National Museum of Ethiopia.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSport facilities include Addis Ababa and Nyala Stadiums. The 2008 African Championships in Athletics were held in Addis Ababa.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe city hosts the We Are the Future center, a child care center that provides children with a higher standard of living. The center is managed under the direction of the mayor's office, and the international NGO Glocal Forum serves as the fundraiser and program planner and coordinator for the WAF child center in each city. Each WAF city is linked to several peer cities and public and private partners to create a unique international coalition.\nLaunched in 2004, the program is the result of a strategic partnership between the Glocal Forum, the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation and Mr. Hani Masri, with the support of the World Bank, UN agencies and major companies.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAddis Ababa University was founded in 1950 and was originally named \"University College of Addis Ababa\", then renamed in 1962 for the former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie I who had donated his Genete Leul Palace to be the university's main campus in the previous year. It is the home of the Institute of Ethiopian Studies and the Ethnological Museum. The city also has numerous public universities and private colleges including Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, Ethiopian Civil Service University, Admas University College, St. Mary's University, Unity University, Kotebe Metropolitan University and Rift Valley University.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nPublic transport is through public buses from three different companies (Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise, Sheger, Alliance), Light Rail or blue and white taxis. The taxis are usually minibuses that can seat at most twelve people, which follow somewhat pre-defined routes. The minibus taxis are typically operated by two people, the driver and a weyala who collects fares and calls out the taxi's destination. Sedan taxis work like normal taxis, and are driven to the desired destination on demand. In recent years, new taxi companies have appeared, which uses other designs, including one large company using yellow sedan taxis.\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe construction of the Addis Ababa Ring Road was initiated in 1998 to implement the city master plan and enhance peripheral development. The Ring Road was divided into three major phases that connect all the five main gates in and out of Addis Ababa with all other regions (Jimma, Bishoftu, Dessie, Gojjam and Ambo). For this project, China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the partner of Addis Ababa City Roads Authority (AACRA). The Ring Road has greatly helped to decongest and alleviate city traffic.\nIntercity bus service is provided by the Lion City Bus Services.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nThe city is served by Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, where a new terminal opened in 2003. The old Lideta Airport in the western \"Old Airport\" district is used mostly by small craft and military planes and helicopters.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nAddis Ababa originally had a railway connection with Djibouti City, with a picturesque French style railway station, but this route has been abandoned. The new Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway started operation in September 2016, running parallel to the route of the original railway line.\n\n\n=== Light rail ===\n\nAddis Ababa opened its light rail system to the public on 20 September 2015. The system is the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe Ethiopian Railway Corporation reached a funding agreement worth millions of dollars with the Export and Import Bank of China in September 2010 and the light rail project was completed in January 2015. The route is a 34.25-kilometre (21.28 mi) network with two lines; the operational line running from the center to the south of the city. Upon completion, the east\u2013west line will run from Ayat to the Torhailoch ring-road, and from Menelik Square to Merkato Bus Station, Meskel Square and Akaki.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nAddis Ababa is twinned with:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nEphraim Isaac: Scholar of Ancient Semitic Studies\nMohammed Hussein Al Amoudi: richest person in Ethiopia (worth $8.1 billion)\nHaile Gebrselassie: Ethiopian long distance runner\nKenenisa Bekele: Ethiopian long distance runner\nTedros Adhanom: Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO)\nSaladin Said: Ethiopian soccer player\nMulatu Astatke: Ethiopian Jazz musician\nMahmoud Ahmed: Ethiopian singer\nTeddy Afro: Ethiopian singer\nBethlehem Tilahun Alemu: Founder of Sole Rebels\nEt\u00e9n\u00e8sh Wassi\u00e9: Ethiopian azmari\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLarge Cities Climate Leadership Group\nAddis Ababa lion\nZewditu Hospital\nALERT (medical facility)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPankhurst, Richard (2001).

The government of the de facto state of Somaliland regards itself as the successor state to the former British Somaliland protectorate, which, in the form of the briefly independent State of Somaliland, united as scheduled on 1 July 1960 with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic.Somaliland lies in northwestern Somalia, on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden. It is bordered by the remainder of Somalia (per international recognition) to the east, Djibouti to the northwest, and Ethiopia to the south and west. Its claimed territory has an area of 176,120 square kilometres (68,000 sq mi), with approximately 4 million residents. The capital and the largest city is Hargeisa, with a population of around 1,500,000 residents.In 1988, the Siad Barre government began a crackdown against the Hargeisa-based Somali National Movement (SNM) and other militant groups, which were among the events that led to the Somali Civil War. The conflict left the country's economic and military infrastructure severely damaged. Following the collapse of Barre's government in early 1991, local authorities, led by the SNM, unilaterally declared independence from Somalia on 18 May of the same year and reinstated the borders of the former short-lived independent State of Somaliland.Since then, the territory has been governed by democratically elected governments that seek international recognition as the Government of the Republic of Somaliland (Somali: Dowlada Jamhuuriyadda Somaliland, Arabic: \u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0635\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062f\u200e Dawlat Jumh\u016br\u012byat \u1e62\u016bm\u0101l\u012bl\u0101nd). The central government maintains informal ties with some foreign governments, who have sent delegations to Hargeisa. Ethiopia also maintains a trade office in the region. However, Somaliland's self-proclaimed independence is not recognised by any country or international organisation. It is a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, an advocacy group whose members consist of indigenous peoples, minorities and unrecognised or occupied territories.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nSomaliland has been inhabited since at least the Paleolithic. During the Stone Age, the Doian and Hargeisan cultures flourished here. The oldest evidence of burial customs in the Horn of Africa comes from cemeteries in Somalia dating back to the 4th millennium BCE. The stone implements from the Jalelo site in the north were also characterized in 1909 as important artefacts demonstrating the archaeological universality during the Paleolithic between the East and the West.According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing Neolithic period from the family's proposed urheimat (\"original homeland\") in the Nile Valley, or the Near East.The Laas Geel complex on the outskirts of Hargeisa in northwestern Somalia dates back around 5,000 years, and has rock art depicting both wild animals and decorated cows. Other cave paintings are found in the northern Dhambalin region, which feature one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is in the distinctive Ethiopian-Arabian style, dated to 1,000 to 3,000 BCE. Additionally, between the towns of Las Khorey and El Ayo in northern Somalia lies Karinhegane, the site of numerous cave paintings of real and mythical animals. Each painting has an inscription below it, which collectively have been estimated to be around 2,500 years old.\n\n\n=== Antiquity and classical era ===\n\nAncient pyramidical structures, mausoleums, ruined cities and stone walls, such as the Wargaade Wall, are evidence of an old civilization that once thrived in the Somali peninsula. This civilization enjoyed a trading relationship with ancient Egypt and Mycenaean Greece since the second millennium BCE, supporting the hypothesis that Somalia or adjacent regions were the location of the ancient Land of Punt. The Puntites traded myrrh, spices, gold, ebony, short-horned cattle, ivory and frankincense with the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Babylonians, Indians, Chinese and Romans through their commercial ports. An Egyptian expedition sent to Punt by the 18th dynasty Queen Hatshepsut is recorded on the temple reliefs at Deir el-Bahari, during the reign of the Puntite King Parahu and Queen Ati. In 2015, isotopic analysis of ancient baboon mummies from Punt that had been brought to Egypt as gifts indicated that the specimens likely originated from an area encompassing eastern Somalia and the Eritrea-Ethiopia corridor.The camel is believed to have been domesticated in the Horn region sometime between the 2nd and 3rd millennium BCE. From there, it spread to Egypt and the Maghreb. During the classical period, the northern Barbara city-states of Mosylon, Opone, Mundus, Isis, Malao, Avalites, Essina, Nikon, and Sarapion developed a lucrative trade network, connecting with merchants from Ptolemaic Egypt, Ancient Greece, Phoenicia, Parthian Persia, Saba, the Nabataean Kingdom, and the Roman Empire. They used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the beden to transport their cargo.After the Roman conquest of the Nabataean Empire and the Roman naval presence at Aden to curb piracy, Arab and Somali merchants agreed with the Romans to bar Indian ships from trading in the free port cities of the Arabian peninsula to protect the interests of Somali and Arab merchants in the lucrative commerce between the Red and Mediterranean Seas. However, Indian merchants continued to trade in the port cities of the Somali peninsula, which was free from Roman interference.For centuries, Indian merchants brought large quantities of cinnamon to Somalia and Arabia from Ceylon and the Spice Islands. The source of the cinnamon and other spices is said to have been the best-kept secret of Arab and Somali merchants in their trade with the Roman and Greek world; the Romans and Greeks believed the source to have been the Somali peninsula. The collusive agreement among Somali and Arab traders inflated the price of Indian and Chinese cinnamon in North Africa, the Near East, and Europe, and made the cinnamon trade a very profitable revenue generator, especially for the Somali merchants through whose hands large quantities were shipped across sea and land routes.\n\n\n=== Birth of Islam and the Middle Ages ===\n\nVarious Somali Muslim kingdoms were established around this period in the area. In the 14th century, the Zeila-based Adal Sultanate battled the forces of the Ethiopian emperor Amda Seyon I. The Ottoman Empire later occupied Berbera and environs in the 1500s. Muhammad Ali, Pasha of Egypt, subsequently established a foothold in the area between 1821 and 1841.\n\n\n=== Early modern sultanates ===\n\nIn the early modern period, successor states to the Adal Sultanate and Ajuran Sultanate began to flourish in Somalia. These included the Warsangali Sultanate.\n\nThe first engagement between Somalis of the region and the British was the 1827 \"Articles of Friendship and Commerce between the Tribe of Habr Awal and England. This was followed by a British treaty with the Governor of Zeila in 1840. An engagement was then started between the British and elders of Habar Garhajis and Habar Toljaala clans of the Isaaq in 1855, followed a year later by the conclusion of the \"Articles of Peace and Friendship\" between the Habar Awal and East India Company. These engagements between the British and Somali clans culminated in the formal treaties the British signed with the henceforth 'British Somaliland' clans, which took place between 1884 and 1886 (treaties were signed with the Habar Awal, Gadabursi, Habar Toljaala, Habar Garhajis, Esa, and the Warsangali clans), this paved the way for the British to establish a protectorate in the region referred to as British Somaliland. The British garrisoned the protectorate from Aden and administered it as part of British India until 1898. British Somaliland was then administered by the Foreign Office until 1905, and afterwards by the Colonial Office.\n\n\n=== British Somaliland ===\n\nThe Somaliland Campaign, also called the Anglo-Somali War or the Dervish War, was a series of military expeditions that took place between 1900 and 1920 in the Horn of Africa, pitting the Dervishes led by Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (nicknamed the \"Mad Mullah\") against the British. The British were assisted in their offensives by the Ethiopians and Italians. During the First World War (1914\u20131918), Hassan also received aid from the Ottomans, Germans and, for a time, from the Emperor Iyasu V of Ethiopia. The conflict ended when the British aerially bombed the Dervish capital of Taleh in February 1920.The Fifth Expedition of the Somaliland campaign in 1920 was the final British expedition against the Dervish forces of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (often called the \"Mad Mullah\" derogatorily by British ), the Somali religious leader. Although the majority of the combat took place in January of the year, British troops had begun preparations for the assault as early as November 1919. The British forces included elements of the Royal Air Force and the Somaliland Camel Corps. After three weeks of battle, Hassan's Dervishes were defeated, bringing an effective end to their 20-year resistance.The Italian conquest of British Somaliland was a military campaign in East Africa, which took place in August 1940 between forces of Italy and those of several British and Commonwealth countries. The Italian expedition was part of the East African Campaign.\n\n\n=== State of Somaliland ===\n\nIn May 1960, the British government stated that it would be prepared to grant independence to the then protectorate of British Somaliland, with the intention that the territory would unite with the Italian-administered Trust Territory of Somaliland under Italian Administration (the former Italian Somaliland).  The Legislative Council of British Somaliland passed a resolution in April 1960 requesting independence and union with the Trust Territory of Somaliland, which was scheduled to gain independence on 1 July that year. The legislative councils of both territories agreed to this proposal following a joint conference in Mogadishu.\nOn 26 June 1960, the former British Somaliland protectorate briefly obtained independence as the State of Somaliland, with the Trust Territory of Somaliland following suit five days later. During its brief period of independence, the State of Somaliland garnered recognition from thirty-five sovereign states. The following day, on 27 June 1960, the newly convened Somaliland Legislative Assembly approved a bill that would formally allow for the union of the State of Somaliland with the Trust Territory of Somaliland on 1 July 1960.\n\n\n=== Somali Republic ===\n\nOn 1 July 1960, the protectorate and the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) united as planned to form the Somali Republic. Inspired by Somali nationalism, the northerners were initially enthusiastic about the union. A government was formed by Abdullahi Issa, with Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as President and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister (later to become President, from 1967 to 1969). On 20 July 1961 and through a popular referendum, the Somali people ratified a new constitution, which was first drafted in 1960. The constitution had little support in the former Somaliland, and was believed to favour the south. Many northerners boycotted the referendum in protest, and over 60% of those who voted in the north were against the new constitution. Regardless, the referendum passed, and Somaliland became quickly dominated by southerners. As result, dissatisfaction became widespread in the north, and support for the union plummeted. British-trained Somaliland officers attempted a revolt to end the union in December 1961. Their uprising failed, and Somaliland continued to be marginalized by the south during the next decades.In 1967, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal became Prime Minister, a position to which he was appointed by Shermarke. Shermarke was assassinated two years later by one of his own bodyguards. His murder was quickly followed by a military coup d'\u00e9tat on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somalian Army seized power without encountering armed opposition. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army. The new regime would go on to rule Somalia for the next 22 years.\n\n\n=== Somali National Movement, Barre persecution ===\n\nThe moral authority of Barre's government was gradually eroded, as many Somalis became disillusioned with life under military rule. By the mid-1980s, resistance movements supported by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration had sprung up across the country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerrillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative centre of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988. The bombardment was led by General Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan, Barre's son-in-law.\n\nAccording to Abou Jeng and other scholars, the Barre regime rule was marked by a targeted brutal persecution of the Isaaq clan. Mohamed Haji Ingiriis and Chris Mullin state that the clampdown by the Barre regime against the Hargeisa-based Somali National Movement targeted the Isaaq clan, to which most members of the SNM belonged. They refer to the clampdown as the Isaaq genocide or Hargeisa holocaust. A United Nations investigation concluded that the crime of genocide was \"conceived, planned and perpetrated by the Somali Government against the Isaaq people\". The number of civilian casualties is estimated to be between 50,000\u2013100,000 according to various sources, while some reports estimate the total civilian deaths to be upwards of 200,000 Isaaq civilians. Along with the deaths, Barre regime bombarded and razed the second and third largest cities in Somalia, Hargeisa and Burao respectively. This displaced an estimated 400,000 local residents to Hartasheikh in Ethiopia; another 400,000 individuals were also internally displaced. \nThe counterinsurgency by the Barre regime against the SNM targeted the rebel group's civilian base of support, escalating into a genocidal onslaught against the Isaaq clan. This led to anarchy and violent campaigns by fragmented militias, which then wrested power at a local level. The Barre regime's persecution was not limited to the Isaaq, as it targeted other clans such as the Hawiye. The Barre regime collapsed in January 1991. Thereafter, as the political situation in Somaliland stabilized, the displaced people returned to their homes, the militias were demobilized or incorporated into the army, and tens of thousands of houses and businesses were reconstructed from rubble.\n\n\n=== Somali Civil War ===\n\nAlthough the SNM at its inception had a unionist constitution, it eventually began to pursue independence, looking to secede from the rest of Somalia. Under the leadership of Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur, the local administration declared the northwestern Somali territories independent at a conference held in Burao between 27 April 1991 and 15 May 1991. Tuur then became the newly established Somaliland polity's first President, but subsequently renounced the separatist platform in 1994 and began instead to publicly seek and advocate reconciliation with the rest of Somalia under a power-sharing federal system of governance. Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal was appointed as Tuur's successor in 1993 by the Grand Conference of National Reconciliation in Borama, which met for four months, leading to a gradual improvement in security, as well as a consolidation of the new territory. Egal was reappointed in 1997, and remained in power until his death on 3 May 2002. The vice-president, Dahir Riyale Kahin, who was during the 1980s the highest-ranking National Security Service (NSS) officer in Berbera in Siad Barre's government, was sworn in as president shortly afterwards. In 2003, Kahin became the first elected president of Somaliland. The war in southern Somalia between Islamist insurgents on the one hand, and the Federal Government of Somalia and its African Union allies on the other, has for the most part not directly affected Somaliland, which, like neighbouring Puntland, has remained relatively stable.\n\n\n=== 2001 Somaliland constitutional referendum ===\n\nIn August 2000, President Egal\u2019s government distributed thousands of copies of the proposed constitution throughout Somaliland for consideration and review by the people. One critical clause of the 130 individual articles of the constitution would ratify Somaliland's self-declared independence and final separation from Somalia, restoring thenation's independence for the first time since 1960. In late March 2001, President Egal set the date for the referendum on the Constitution for May 31, 2001.A constitutional referendum was held in Somaliland on 31 May 2001. The referendum was held on a draft constitution that affirmed Somaliland's independence from Somalia. 99.9% of eligible voters took part in the referendum and 97.1% of them voted in favour of the constitution.\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\n\nThe guurti worked with rebel leaders to set up a new government, and was incorporated into the governance structure, becoming the Parliament's House of Elders. The government became in essence a \"power-sharing coalition of Somaliland's main clans,\" with seats in the Upper and Lower houses proportionally allocated to clans according to a predetermined formula, although not all clans are satisfied with their representation. In 2002, after several extensions of this interim government, Somaliland transitioned to multi-party democracy. The election was limited to three parties, in an attempt to create ideology based elections rather than clan based elections. As of December 2014, Somaliland has three political parties: the Peace, Unity, and Development Party, the Justice and Development Party, and Wadani. Under the Somaliland Constitution, a maximum of three political parties is allowed.The Executive is led by an elected president, whose government includes a vice-president and a Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers, who are responsible for the normal running of government, are nominated by the President and approved by the Parliament's House of Representatives. The President must approve bills passed by the Parliament before they come into effect. Presidential elections are confirmed by the National Electoral Commission of Somaliland. The President can serve a maximum of two five-year terms.\n\nLegislative power is held by the bicameral Parliament. Its upper house is the House of Elders, this chamber is chaired by Suleiman Mohamoud Adan, and the lower house is the House of Representatives. The lower house is chaired by Bashe Mohamed Farah. Each house has 82 members. Members of the House of Elders are elected indirectly by local communities for six-year terms. The House of Elders shares power in passing laws with the House of Representatives, and also has the role of solving internal conflicts, and an exclusive power to extend the terms of the President and representatives under circumstances that make an election impossible. Members of the House of Representatives are directly elected by the people for five-year terms. The House of Representatives shares voting power with the House of Elders, though it can pass a law that the House of Elders rejects if it votes for the law by a 2/3's majority, and has absolute power in financial matters and confirmation of Presidential appointments (except for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court).The judicial system is divided into district courts, (which deal with matters of family law and succession, lawsuits for amounts up to 3 million SL, criminal cases punishable by up to 3 years imprisonment or 3 million SL fines, and crimes committed by juveniles), regional courts (which deal with lawsuits and criminal cases not within the jurisdiction of district courts, labour and employment claims, and local government elections), regional appeals courts (which deal with all appeals from district and regional courts), and the Supreme Court (which deals with issues between courts and in government, and reviews its own decisions), which is the highest court and also functions as the Constitutional Court.Somaliland nationality law defines who is a Somaliland citizen, as well as the procedures by which one may be naturalised into Somaliland citizenship or renounce it.The Somaliland government continues to apply the 1962 penal code of the Somali Republic. As such, homosexual acts are illegal in the territory.Freedom House ranks the Somaliland government as partly democratic. Seth Kaplan (2011) argues that in contrast to southern Somalia and adjacent territories, Somaliland, the secessionist northwestern portion of Somalia, has built a more democratic mode of governance from the bottom up, with virtually no foreign assistance. Specifically, Kaplan suggests that Somaliland has the most democratic political system in the Horn of Africa because it has been largely insulated from the extremist elements in the rest of Somalia and has viable electoral and legislative systems as well as a robust private sector-dominated economy, unlike neighbouring authoritarian governments. He largely attributes this to Somaliland's integration of customary laws and tradition with modern state structures, which he indicates most post-colonial states in Africa and the Middle East have not had the opportunity to do. Kaplan asserts that this has facilitated cohesiveness and conferred greater governmental legitimacy in Somaliland, as has the territory's comparatively homogeneous population, relatively equitable income distribution, common fear of the south, and absence of interference by outside forces, which has obliged local politicians to observe a degree of accountability.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nSomaliland has political contacts with its neighbours Ethiopia and Djibouti, as well as with South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the micro-nation of Liberland. On 17 January 2007, the European Union (EU) sent a delegation for foreign affairs to discuss future co-operation. The African Union (AU) has also sent a foreign minister to discuss the future of international acknowledgment, and on 29 and 30 January 2007, the ministers stated that they would discuss acknowledgement with the organisation's member states.\nIn early 2006, the National Assembly of Wales extended an official invitation to the Somaliland government to attend the royal opening of the Senedd in Cardiff. The move was seen as an act of recognition by the Welsh Assembly of the breakaway government's legitimacy. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office made no comment on the invitation. Wales is home to a significant Somali expatriate community from Somaliland.In 2007, a delegation led by President Kahin was present at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kampala, Uganda. Although Somaliland has applied to join the Commonwealth under observer status, its application is still pending.On 24 September 2010, Johnnie Carson, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, stated that the United States would be modifying its strategy in Somalia and would seek deeper engagement with the governments of Somaliland and Puntland while continuing to support the Somali Transitional Government. Carson said the US would send aid workers and diplomats to Puntland and Somaliland and alluded to the possibility of future development projects. However, Carson emphasised that the US would not extend formal recognition to either region.\n\nThe then-UK Minister for Africa, Henry Bellingham MP, met President Silanyo of Somaliland in November 2010 to discuss ways in which to increase the UK's engagement with Somaliland. President Silanyo said during his visit to London: \"We have been working with the international community and the international community has been engaging with us, giving us assistance and working with us in our democratisation and development programmes. And we are very happy with the way the international community has been dealing with us, particularly the UK, the US, other European nations and our neighbours who continue to seek recognition.\" Recognition of Somaliland by the UK has also been supported by the UK Independence Party, which came 3rd in the popular vote at the 2015 General Election. The leader of UKIP, Nigel Farage, met with Ali Aden Awale, Head of the Somaliland UK Mission on Somaliland's national day, 18 May, in 2015, to express UKIP's support for Somaliland. Nigel Farage said that \"Somaliland has been a beacon of peace, democracy and the Rule of Law, in the Horn of Africa for the past 24 years. It is about time the UK and the rest of the international community recognised Somaliland's case for recognition. It's about time peace was rewarded. For the UK to turn its back on their legitimate demands for sovereignty, is wrong. It is extraordinary that we have not been lobbying for their admittance to the Commonwealth. In recent years, we have supported the admission of countries such as Mozambique which have no historic links to Britain, but Somaliland, a former protectorate is left in the cold. This must change\".In 2011, Somaliland and the neighbouring Puntland region each entered a security-related memorandum of understanding with the Seychelles. Following the framework of an earlier agreement signed between the Transitional Federal Government and the Seychelles, the memorandum is \"for the transfer of convicted persons to prisons in 'Puntland' and 'Somaliland'\".\nOn 1 July 2020, Somaliland and Taiwan signed an agreement to set up representative offices to promote cooperation between the two countries. Cooperation between the two polities on education, maritime security, and medicine began in 2009, and Taiwanese staff entered Somaliland in February 2020 to prepare for the representative office.\n\n\n=== Border disputes ===\n\nSomaliland continues to claim the entire area of the former British Somaliland. It is currently in control of the western half of the former British Somaliland, with northeastern Maakhir having declared itself a separate, unrecognised autonomous state within Somalia in July 2007, and the disputed southeastern Sool state had been under the control of neighbouring Puntland. A coalition of Gadabuursi intellectuals hailing from the westernmost Awdal province have threatened to secede if Somaliland's independence is recognised.Tensions between Puntland and Somaliland escalated into violence several times between 2002 and 2009. In October 2004, and again in April and October 2007, armed forces of Somaliland and Puntland clashed near the town of Las Anod, the capital of Sool region. In October 2007, Somaliland troops took control of the town. While celebrating Puntland's 11th anniversary on 2 August 2009, Puntland officials vowed to recapture Las Anod. While Somaliland claims independent statehood and therefore \"split up\" the \"old\" Somalia, Puntland works for the re-establishment of a united but federal Somali state.Somaliland forces took control of the town of Las Qorey in eastern Sanaag on 10 July 2008, along with positions 5 km (3 mi) east of the town. The defence forces completed their operations on 9 July 2008 after the Maakhir and Puntland militia in the area left their positions, but control of the territory was later assumed by Puntland as Maakhir was incorporated into the autonomous region in January 2009.In the late 2000s, HBM-SSC (Hoggaanka Badbaadada iyo Mideynta SSC), a local unionist group based in Sanaag was formed with the goal to establish its own regional administration (Sool, Sanaag and Cayn, or SSC). This later evolved into Khatumo State, which was established in 2012. The local administration and its constituents does not recognise the Somaliland government's claim to sovereignty or to its territory.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nThe Somaliland Armed Forces are the main military command in Somaliland. Along with the Somaliland Police and all other internal security forces, they are overseen by Somaliland's Ministry of Defence. The current head of Somaliland's Armed Forces is the Minister of Defence, Abdiqani Mohamoud Aateye.The Somaliland Army consists of twelve divisions equipped primarily with light weaponry, though it is equipped with some howitzers and mobile rocket launchers. Its armoured vehicles and tanks are mostly of Soviet design, though there are some ageing Western vehicles and tanks in its arsenal. The Somaliland Navy (often referred to as a Coast Guard by the Associated Press), despite a crippling lack of equipment and formal training, has apparently had some success at curbing both piracy and illegal fishing within Somaliland waters.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Regions ===\nThe following regions are taken from  Michael Walls: State Formation in Somaliland: Bringing Deliberation to Institutionalism from 2011, Somaliland: The Strains of Success from 2015 and ActionAID, a humanitarian organization currently active in Somaliland.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSomaliland is situated in northwestern Somalia. It lies between the 08\u00b000' \u2013 11\u00b030' parallel north of the equator and between 42\u00b030' \u2013 49\u00b000' meridian east of Greenwich. It is bordered by Djibouti to the west, Ethiopia to the south, and the Puntland region of Somalia to the east. Somaliland has a 740 kilometres (460 mi) coastline with the majority lying along the Gulf of Aden. In terms of landmass, Somaliland's territory is comparable to that of Uruguay, with an area of 176,120 km2 (68,000 sq mi).\nSomaliland's climate is a mixture of wet and dry conditions. The northern part of the region is hilly, and in many places the altitude ranges between 900 and 2,100 metres (3,000 and 6,900 ft) above sea level. The Awdal, Sahil and Maroodi Jeex (Woqooyi Galbeed) regions are fertile and mountainous, while Togdheer is mostly semi-desert with little fertile greenery around. The Awdal region is also known for its offshore islands, coral reefs and mangroves.\nA scrub-covered, semi-desert plain referred as the Guban lies parallel to the Gulf of Aden littoral. With a width of twelve kilometres (7.5 miles) in the west to as little as two kilometres (1.2 miles) in the east, the plain is bisected by watercourses that are essentially beds of dry sand except during the rainy seasons. When the rains arrive, the Guban's low bushes and grass clumps transform into lush vegetation. This coastal strip is part of the Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands ecoregion.\nCal Madow is a mountain range in the northern part of the country. Extending from the northwest of Erigavo to several kilometres west of the city of Bosaso, it features Somalia's highest peak, Shimbiris, which sits at an elevation of about 2,416 metres (7,927 ft). The rugged east\u2013west ranges of the Karkaar Mountains also lie to the interior of the Gulf of Aden littoral. In the central regions, the northern mountain ranges give way to shallow plateaus and typically dry watercourses that are referred to locally as the Ogo. The Ogo's western plateau, in turn, gradually merges into the Haud, an important grazing area for livestock.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSomaliland is located north of the Equator. It is semi-arid. The average daily temperatures range from 25 to 35 \u00b0C (77 to 95 \u00b0F). The sun passes vertically overhead twice a year, on 22 March and 23 September. Somaliland consists of three main topographic zones: (1). A Coastal Plain (Guban) (2) The Coastal Range (Oogo) (3) A Plateau (Hawd) The Coastal Plain (Guban) is a zone with high temperatures and low rainfall. Summer temperatures in the region easily average over 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). However, temperatures come down during the winter, and both human and livestock populations increase dramatically in the region.\nThe Coastal Range (Ogo) is a high plateau to the immediate south of Guban. Its elevation ranges from 6,000 feet (1,800 m) above sea level in the West to 7,000 feet (2,100 m) in the East. Rainfall is heavier there than in Guban, although it varies considerably within the zone. The Plateau (Hawd) region lies to the south of Ogo range. It is generally more heavily populated during the wet season, when surface water is available. It is also an important area for grazing. Somalilanders recognize four seasons in the year; GU and Hagaa comprise spring and summer in that order, and Dayr and Jiilaal correspond to autumn and winter respectively.The average annual rainfall is 446 millimetres (17.6 in) in some parts of country according to availability of rain gauge, and most of it comes during Gu and Dayr. GU, which is the first, or major, rainy season (late March, April, May, and early June), experiences the heaviest rainfall in Ogo range and Hawd. This constitutes the period of fresh grazing and abundant surface water. It is also the breeding season for livestock. Hagaa (from late June through August) is usually dry although there are often some scattered showers in the Ogo range, these are known as Karan rains. Hagaa tends to be hot and windy in most parts of the country. Deyr (September, October, and early November), which roughly corresponds to autumn, is the second, or minor, wet season; as the word \"minor\" suggests, the amount of precipitation is generally less than that of Gu. Jilaal, or winter, falls in the coolest and driest months of the year (from late November to early March). It is a season of thirst. Hawd receive virtually no rainfall in winter. The rainfall in the Guban zone, known as \"Hays\", comes from December to February. The humidity of the country varies from 63% in the dry season to 82% in the wet season.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Somaliland shilling, which cannot easily be exchanged outside Somaliland on account of the nation's lack of recognition, is regulated by the Bank of Somaliland, the central bank, which was established constitutionally in 1994. It may not be considered valid tender in disputed areas such as Ayn or the district of Badhan, which are not administered as part of Somaliland and continue to use the Somali shilling despite being claimed by the Somaliland government.Since Somaliland is unrecognised, international donors have found it difficult to provide aid. As a result, the government relies mainly upon tax receipts and remittances from the large Somali diaspora, which contribute immensely to Somaliland's economy. Remittances come to Somaliland through money transfer companies, the largest of which is Dahabshiil, one of the few Somali money transfer companies that conform to modern money-transfer regulations. The World Bank estimates that remittances worth approximately US$1 billion reach Somalia annually from \u00e9migr\u00e9s working in the Gulf states, Europe and the United States. Analysts say that Dahabshiil may handle around two-thirds of that figure and as much as half of it reaches Somaliland alone.\n\nSince the late 1990s, service provisions have significantly improved through limited government provisions and contributions from non-governmental organisations, religious groups, the international community (especially the diaspora), and the growing private sector. Local and municipal governments have been developing key public service provisions such as water in Hargeisa and education, electricity, and security in Berbera. In 2009, the Banque pour le Commerce et l'Industrie \u2013 Mer Rouge (BCIMR), based in Djibouti, opened a branch in Hargeisa and became the first bank in the country since the 1990 collapse of the Commercial and Savings Bank of Somalia. In 2014, Dahabshil Bank International became the region's first commercial bank. In 2017 Premier Bank from Mogadishu opened a branch in Hargeisa.\n\nVarious telecommunications firms also have branches in Somaliland. Among these companies is Telesom, one of the largest operators in Somaliland. Founded in 2002 with the objective of supplying the local market with telecommunications services such as GSM, fixed line, and Internet access, it has an extensive network that covers all of Somaliland's major cities and more than 40 districts in both Somalia and Somaliland. Telesom also offers among the cheapest international calling rates at US$0.2 less than its nearest competitor. Other telecommunication firms serving the region include Somtel, Telcom and NationLink.Livestock is the backbone of Somaliland's economy. Sheep, camels, and cattle are shipped from the Berbera port and sent to Gulf Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia.Agriculture is generally considered to be a potentially successful industry, especially in the production of cereals and horticulture. Mining also has potential, though simple quarrying represents the extent of current operations, despite the presence of diverse quantities of mineral deposits.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe rock art and caves at Laas Geel, situated on the outskirts of Hargeisa, are a popular local tourist attraction. Totaling ten caves, they were discovered by a French archaeological team in 2002 and are believed to date back around 5,000 years. The government and locals keep the cave paintings safe and only a restricted number of tourists are allowed entry. Other notable sights include the Freedom Arch in Hargeisa and the War Memorial in the city centre. Natural attractions are very common around the region. The Naasa Hablood are twin hills located on the outskirts of Hargeisa that Somalis in the region consider to be a majestic natural landmark.The Ministry of Tourism has also encouraged travellers to visit historic towns and cities in Somaliland. The historic town of Sheekh is located near Berbera and is home to old British colonial buildings that have remained untouched for over forty years. Berbera also houses historic and impressive Ottoman architectural buildings. Another equally famous historic city is Zeila. Zeila was once part of the Ottoman Empire, a dependency of Yemen and Egypt and a major trade city during the 19th century. The city has been visited for its old colonial landmarks, offshore mangroves and coral reefs, towering cliffs, and beach. The nomadic culture of Somaliland has also attracted tourists. Most nomads live in the countryside.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nBus services operate in Hargeisa, Burao, Gabiley, Berbera and Borama. There are also road transportation services between the major towns and adjacent villages, which are operated by different types of vehicles. Among these are taxis, four-wheel drives, minibuses and light goods vehicles (LGV).The most prominent airlines serving Somaliland is Daallo Airlines, a Somali-owned private carrier with regular international flights that emerged after Somali Airlines ceased operations. African Express Airways and Ethiopian Airlines also fly from airports in Somaliland to Djibouti City, Addis Ababa, Dubai and Jeddah, and offer flights for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages via the Egal International Airport in Hargeisa. Other major airports in the region include the Berbera Airport.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\nIn June 2016, the Somaliland government signed an agreement with DP World to manage the strategic port of Berbera with the aim of enhancing productive capacity and acting as an alternative port for landlocked Ethiopia.\n\n\n=== Oil explorations ===\n\nIn August 2012, the Somaliland government awarded Genel Energy license to explore oil within its territory. Results of a surface seep study completed early in 2015 confirmed the outstanding potential offered in SL-10B and SL-13 block and Oodweyne block with estimated oil reserves of 1 billion barrel each. Genel Energy is set to drill exploration well for SL-10B and SL-13 block in Buur-Dhaab 20 kilometers northwest of Aynabo by the end of 2018.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe Subeer Awal subclan of the Isaaq form the majority of the population living in both the northern and western portions of the Woqooyi Galbeed region, including the cities and towns of Northern Hargeisa, Berbera, Gabiley, Madheera, Wajaale, Arabsiyo, Bulhar and Kalabaydh. The Subeer Awal also have a strong presence in Northern Togdheer region as well, principally around the town of Sheikh and they also partially inhabit the city of Burao as well.\nThe Garhajis subclan of the Isaaq have a sizable presence among the population inhabiting the southern and eastern portions of Woqooyi Galbeed region including Southern Hargeisa and Salahlay. The Garhajis are also represented well in western Togdheer region, mainly in the towns of Oodweyne and Western Burao. The Garhajis also form a majority of the population inhabiting the western and central areas of Sanaag region as well, including the regional capital Erigavo as well as Maydh.The Habar Jeclo subclan of Isaaq have a large presence in the western and northern parts of Sool, eastern Togdheer region and southwestern Sanaag as well, The Habar Jeclo form a majority of the population living in Eastern Burao as well as in Aynabo district and in the towns of Garadag and Ceel Afweyn.Eastern Sool region's residents mainly hail from the Dhulbahante, a subdivision of the Harti confederation of Darod sub-clans, and are concentrated at Las Anod. The Dhulbahante clans also settle in the Buuhoodle District in the Togdheer region, and the southern and eastern parts of Erigavo District in Sanaag.The Warsangali, another Harti Darod sub-clan, constitute a large number of residents in the eastern Sanaag, and their population is mainly concentrated around Las Qorey.The Gadabuursi are the predominant clan of the Awdal Region, where there is also a sizeable minority of the Issa subclan of the Dir who mainly inhabit the Zeila district.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\n \nMany people in Somaliland speak two of the three official languages: Somali, Arabic and English, although the rate of bilingualism is lower in rural areas. Article 6 of the Constitution of 2001 designates the official language of Somaliland to be Somali, though Arabic is a mandatory subject in school and is used in mosques around the region and English is spoken and taught in schools. English was proclaimed an official language later, outside the constitution.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nWith few exceptions, Somalis in Somaliland and elsewhere are Muslims, the majority belonging to the Sunni branch of Islam and the Shafi'i school of Islamic jurisprudence. As with southern Somali coastal towns such as Mogadishu and Merca, there is also a presence of Sufism, Islamic mysticism; particularly the Arab Rifa'iya tariiqa. Through the influence of the diaspora from Yemen and the Gulf states, stricter Wahhabism also has a noticeable presence. Though traces of pre-Islamic traditional religion exist in Somaliland, Islam is dominant to the Somali sense of national identity. Many of the Somali social norms come from their religion. For example, most Somali women wear a hijab when they are in public. In addition, religious Somalis abstain from pork and alcohol, and also try to avoid receiving or paying any form of interest (usury). Muslims generally congregate on Friday afternoons for a sermon and group prayer.Under the Constitution of Somaliland, Islam is the state religion of Somaliland, and no laws may violate the principles of Sharia. The promotion of any religion other than Islam is illegal, and the state promotes Islamic tenets and discourages behaviour contrary to \"Islamic morals\".Somaliland has very few Christians. In 1913, during the early part of the colonial era, there were virtually no Christians in the Somali territories, with about 100\u2013200 followers coming from the schools and orphanages of the handful of Catholic missions in the British Somaliland protectorate. The small number of Christians in the region today mostly come from similar Catholic institutions in Aden, Djibouti, and Berbera.Somaliland falls within the Episcopal Area of the Horn of Africa as part of Somalia, under the Anglican Diocese of Egypt. However, there are no current congregations in the territory. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio is designated to serve the area as part of Somalia. However, since 1990 there has been no Bishop of Mogadishu, and the Bishop of Djibouti acts as Apostolic Administrator. The Adventist Mission also indicates that there are no Adventist members.\n\n\n=== Largest cities ===\n\n\n=== Health ===\nWhile 40.5% of households in Somaliland have access to improved water sources, almost a third of households lie at least an hour away from their primary source of drinking water. 1 in 11 children die before their first birthday, and 1 in 9 die before their fifth birthday.The UNICEF multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS) in 2006 found that 94.8% of women in Somaliland had undergone some form of female genital mutilation; in 2018 the Somaliland government issued a fatwa condemning the two most severe forms of FGM, but no laws are present to punish those responsible for the practice.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nSomaliland has a population of about 3.5 million people. As of 2006, the largest clan family in Somaliland is the Isaaq, making up 80% of the total population. The populations of five major cities in Somaliland \u2013 Hargeisa, Burao, Berbera, Erigavo and Gabiley \u2013 are predominantly Isaaq. Of the minority clans, the Gadabuursi of the Dir clan comes second by population, and thirdly the Harti of the Darod clan.The clan groupings of the Somali people are important social units, and have a central role in Somali culture and politics. Clans are patrilineal and are often divided into sub-clans, sometimes with many sub-divisions.Somali society is traditionally ethnically endogamous. To extend ties of alliance, marriage is often to another ethnic Somali from a different clan. Thus, for example, a recent study observed that in 89 marriages contracted by men of the Dhulbahante clan, 55 (62%) were with women of Dhulbahante sub-clans other than those of their husbands; 30 (33.7%) were with women of surrounding clans of other clan families (Isaaq, 28; Hawiye, 3); and 3 (4.3%) were with women of other clans of the Darod clan family (Majerteen 2, Ogaden 1).\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nIt is considered polite for one to leave a little bit of food on one's plate after finishing a meal at another's home. This tells the host that one has been given enough food. If one were to clean their plate that would indicate that one is still hungry. Most Somalis do not take this rule so seriously, but it is certainly not impolite to leave a few bits of food on one's plate. Somali breakfast typically includes a flatbread called lahoh (injera), as well as liver, toast, harakoo, cereal, and porridge made of millet or cornmeal. Lunch can be a mixture of rice or pasta with meat and sauce.\nAlso consumed during lunchtime is a traditional soup referred to as maraq, which is also part of Yemeni cuisine. Maraq is made of vegetables, meat and beans and is usually eaten with flatbread or pita bread. Later in the day, a lighter meal is served that includes beans, ful medames, muffo (patties made of oats or corn), or a salad with more lahoh/injera.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nIslam and poetry have been described as the twin pillars of Somali culture. Somali poetry is mainly oral, with both male and female poets. They use things that are common in the Somali language as metaphors. Almost all Somalis are Sunni Muslims and Islam is vitally important to the Somali sense of national identity. Most Somalis do not belong to a specific mosque or sect and can pray in any mosque they find.Celebrations come in the form of religious festivities. Two of the most important are Eid ul-Adha and Eid ul-Fitr, which marks the end of the fasting month. Families get dressed up to visit one another, and money is donated to the poor. Other holidays include 26 June and 18 May, which celebrate British Somaliland's independence and the Somaliland region's establishment, respectively; the latter, however, is not recognised by the international community.\n\nIn the nomadic culture, where one's possessions are frequently moved, there is little reason for the plastic arts to be highly developed. Somalis embellish and decorate their woven and wooden milk jugs (haamo; the most decorative jugs are made in Ceerigaabo) as well as wooden headrests. Traditional dance is also important, though mainly as a form of courtship among young people. One such dance known as Ciyaar Soomaali is a local favourite.An important form of art in Somali culture is henna art. The custom of applying henna dates back to antiquity. During special occasions, a Somali woman's hands and feet are expected to be covered in decorative mendhi. Girls and women usually apply or decorate their hands and feet in henna on festive celebrations like Eid or weddings. The henna designs vary from very simple to highly intricate. Somali designs vary, with some more modern and simple while others are traditional and intricate. Traditionally, only women apply it as body art, as it is considered a feminine custom. Henna is not only applied on the hands and feet but is also used as a dye. Somali men and women alike use henna as a dye to change their hair colour. Women are free to apply henna on their hair as most of the time they are wearing a hijab.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOutline of Somaliland\nTelecommunications in Somaliland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources and references ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

        "wiki": "Debre Libanos (Amharic: \u12f0\u1265\u1228 \u120a\u1263\u1296\u1235) is a monastery in Ethiopia, lying northwest of Addis Ababa in the Semien Shewa Zone of the Oromia Region. Founded in the 13th century by Saint Tekle Haymanot, according to tradition, he meditated in a cave for 29 years. The monastery's chief abbot, called the Ichege, was the second most powerful official in the Ethiopian Church after the Abuna. \nThe monastery complex sits on a terrace between a cliff and the gorge of one of the tributaries of the Abbay River. None of the original buildings of Debre Libanos survive, although David Buxton suspected \"there are interesting things still to be found among the neighbouring cliffs.\" Current buildings include the church over Tekle Haymanot's tomb, which Emperor Haile Selassie ordered constructed in 1961; a slightly older Church of the Cross, where Buxton was told a fragment of the True Cross is preserved; and five religious schools. The cave where the saint lived is in the nearby cliffs, which one travel guide describes as a five-minute walk away. This cave contains a spring, whose water is considered holy and is the object of pilgrimages.\nAccording to David Buxton, the original route to Debre Libanos was through a cleft in the cliffs that line the eastern side of the Abay. In the later 20th century a road was laid from the main Addis Ababa \u2013 Debre Marqos highway to the monastery; it is a little more than four kilometers long.\n\n\n== History ==\nDebre Libanos suffered great destruction during the invasion of Ahmad Gragn when one of his followers, Ura'i Abu Bakr, set it on fire 21 July 1531, despite the attempts of its community to ransom the church. Although the Ichege intervened to protect the Gambos during the reign of Sarsa Dengel, the buildings were not completely rebuilt until after the visit of Emperor Iyasu the Great in 1699.In the reign of Emperor Fasilides, after invading Oromos had ravaged the monastery's lands in Shewa the Emperor granted the Ichege his palace at Azazo, where the various Ichege lived.From the 17th century until the matter was resolved in a synod convened by Emperor Yohannes II, the Ichege and the monks of Debre Libanos were the most important supporters of the Sost Lidet doctrine, in opposition to the House of Ewostatewos.\nEmperor Haile Selassie's interest in Debre Libanos dates to when he was governor of the district of Selale. The Emperor notes in his autobiography that during the reconstruction of the church at Debre Libanos, an inscribed gold ring was found in the excavations, which he personally delivered to then Emperor Menelik II.Following the attempted assassination on his life on 19 February 1937, governor Rodolfo Graziani believed the monastery's monks and novices were involved in this attack, and unwilling to wait for the results of the official investigation, ordered Italian colonialists to massacre the inhabitants of this monastery. On 21 May of that year, 297 monks and 23 laymen were killed. Although when Buxton visited Debre Libanos in the mid-1940s, he found the remains of these victims were plainly visible (\"Here were innumerable bones and skulls \u2013 bones in bags and bones in boxes, bones lying in confused heaps, awaiting burial\"); a cross-shaped tomb was afterwards built to contain their remains, which stands next to the parking lot.\n\n\n== Mosaics ==\nMosaics and stained-glass for the monastery were made and exhibited in London at the Festival Hall by E.O. Hevezi and G.J. Bajo.\n\n\n== Burials ==\nAbuna Basilios\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Saint George Sports Club (Amharic: \u1245\u12f1\u1235 \u130a\u12ee\u122d\u130a\u1235 \u1235\u1356\u122d\u1275 \u12ad\u1208\u1265, Kidus Giorgis Sport Club) is an Ethiopian football club based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. They are members of the Ethiopian Football Federation and play in the top division of Ethiopian football, the Ethiopian Premier League. Founded in 1935, the club was the first in Ethiopia and was established as a symbol of Ethiopian nationalism and resistance against the occupying forces of fascist Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nThe club was founded on 1935 at Doro Manekia in George Dukas's family house by Ethiopian Ayele Atnash and Greek George Ducas. Established in the Arada (Arada Giorgis) neighborhood of Addis Ababa during Fascist Italy's invasion of Ethiopia, the club quickly became the symbol of Ethiopian nationalism in the midst of Italian occupation. The patriotic struggle of the 1930s left an indelible mark on the club and the Arada neighborhood, defining both for centuries to come. The history of the club is often thought to be heavily influenced by this neighborhood. St George was said to have started with only 2 Tegera Birr, 1 ball, goal posts and a stamp.\nOften finding it hard to play football on local pitches due to restrictions placed on them by the Arada police, the club had to constantly move from place to place. In one instance the club members tried carrying goal posts to 'Filwehameda' ( presently located next to Custom Authorities Head Office), but were ultimately chased away by authorities. Attempts to play at  'Aroge Kera' on the 'Etege Menen' field were also unsuccessful as unhappy local villagers chased them away. Then they went to 'Belay Zeleke' 'Zebegna Sefer' village, but Arada police came and chased them away once again.\nMatches were organized against other local teams or groups in the area such as those of the Armenian community of Addis Ababa. However, because the club was short handed in the number of players they had they ended up recruiting others to play. This is how  Yidnekachew Tessema came to be a part of the team, he was found on the streets of Addis and was asked to join them for the match. It was said that he was spotted while crossing Berad Mekonnen bridge and since he went to Teferi Mekonnen School where all club members went to school,  they were familiar with him. After agreeing to join them, St. George was able to beat the Armenian team 2-0 thanks to two goals by Yidnekachew himself.\nThe club's first jerseys were brown and white, affordable cloth for the cash strapped club at the time. One of the founders, George Ducas, used scrap together money from his parents to support the club. Others in the club would go around knocking at doors singing traditional songs like \"Hoya Hoye\" in order to earn money for the club. The customary reward for their singing efforts was bread, not money, but they were able collect this bread in a sacks to sell it in laborers' villages to earn the money. Once the club was able to find some funds they were able to get a New Jersey that implies their unity with the Ethiopian flag colors.  They gave the first jersey to the second team and started wearing the new ones until pressure from the occupying police force made them have to hide this New Jersey underneath their clothing.\nAfter buying jersey with the money, the club bought food for the players with the rest of the money. The members and players of the club would to eat bread and tea after matches and training sessions.\n\n\n=== Connection to the Ethiopian Struggle ===\nWhen Italian efforts to directly destroy St. George didn't work, they forced the club to change its name and play matches against a club the Italians had created called '6 kilo'. This club was purposely created by Italians to weaken and demoralize St. George. Sponsored by the nearby factory 'Cugnac Alovo', 6 Kilo (also called 'Cenco Maje' to mean July 5), had more money and supplies than St. George. They beat St. George on multiple occasions and St. George also did the same however those matches nearly always ended with beatings by the Arada (Italian) police.\nThe ongoing Guerrilla warfare during this time was of  the utmost importance to the club and its members. Knowing this the Italians trying using the club as a propaganda tool for their own administration in order to confuse and entrap the guerilla fighters. The Italians sent a messages to resistance leaders like Ras. Abebe Aregay to \"come and see the people is in peace\" inviting him to watch a football match at JanMeda, a popular field in Addis Ababa.\nHearing this the guerilla fighters took an Italian General as leverage not trusting the Italians and Ras. Abebe Aregay sent Demissie W/Michael to investigate the situation. Having been warned before hand to peacefully play the match, St. George was picked to play against \"6 Kilo\". The game quickly turned into a physical fight after kickoff with spectators often cheering and whistling to encourage the fight rather than the game. Then the game was interrupted and the Italians' plan foiled.\nIn 1941 when Ethiopia was liberated from fascist Italian control and Haile Selassie I had returned, it was us the club supporters along with fellow Addis Ababians that sang the national anthem \"Ethiopia hoy des Yebelesh\"(to mean, Rejoice Ethiopia) to welcome him back. An anthem that was written by a huge St. George supporters Yoftahe Nigussie and produced by Captain Nalbadin.\n\n\n=== Ethiopian League Football ===\nThe first officially recognized version of an Ethiopian football league was established in 1944. Originally five teams representing the various communities of Addis Ababa including St. George (Ethiopian), Fortitudo (Italian), Ararat (Armenian), Olympiakos (Greek) and the British Military Mission in Ethiopia (BMME) contested for the title which was won by the BMME. In 1947, the country's formal national league kicked off with three teams; St. George, Mechale and Ke'ay Bahir. The club remained within the league for twenty-five years before the Derg reorganized the football leagues, and forced all existing clubs to shut down. In this process the club had its name changed to Addis Ababa Brewery in 1972 only to change it back four years later. The club switched its name back an forth for 19 years until the fall of the Derg in 1991 when the club officially changed its name back to St. George.\nSt. George enjoyed some dominance in the late 60's after which the league went through a period of relative parity in the 70's and 80's. However, during the premier league era no club has been more dominant than St. George S.C., amassing an impressive 14 titles since the start of the era in the 1997-98 season. As of 2017, the club has a combined 29 top division titles which is by far the most in Ethiopian football.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\nThe club is owned by the St. George Football Association. It is also financially supported by prominent Saudi Businessman Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi and Ethiopian businessman Abenet Gebremeskel, who is also chairman of the club.\nIn June 2018 it was announced that the club would sell most of its shares to fans.\n\n\n== Supporters ==\nSaint George have one of the largest fan bases in all of Ethiopian football and are known for their fervent displays during home matches. Often singing the club's anthem and waving yellow and orange checkered flags, the supporters of Saint George provide some of the most festive atmospheres in Ethiopian football.\nThe ultras of the club are known to be involved in hooliganism, which is a very prevalent phenomenon in the Ethiopian football. Clashes with rival support groups are common, especially during derby matches such as in the \"Sheger Derby\".\nIn the early days chants supporters of the club used to repeat went as follows:\nIn reference to their early rivals \"6 kilo\":\n\u00ab\u12ed\u132b\u12c8\u1271 \u1290\u1260\u122d \u1260\u1274\u1235\u1273 \u1260\u130b\u1295\u1263\u1363\n\u1218\u1308\u1295 6 \u12aa\u120e \u1270\u1238\u1295\u134e \u1308\u1263\u1362\u00bb meaning \"6 kilo, although playing with their legs and kicking players with headers, they always lose\"\nIn reference to founder Ayele Atnash.\n\u00ab\u130d\u1325\u121d \u12a0\u12ed\u1290\u1243\u1290\u1245\u121d \u12e8\u1265\u1228\u1275 \u12f2\u1302\u1296\u1363\n\u12a5\u1295\u12f4\u1275 \u1290\u1205 \u12a0\u12e8\u1208 \u12e8\u12a0\u122b\u12f3 \u1270\u122d\u1232\u1296?\u00bb meaning \"firm as a metal steal, how are you Ayele Atnash, Arada's Tersino?\"\nIn reference to outstanding players Elias (who later became a pilot) and Yidnekachew.\n\u00ab\u1260\u1230\u121b\u12ed \u12a4\u120d\u12eb\u1235 \u1260\u121d\u12f5\u122d \u12ed\u12f5\u1290\u1243\u1278\u12cd\u1363 \n\u1208\u1218\u1273\u1230\u1262\u12eb\u1290\u1275 \u12a5\u130d\u12dc\u122d \u1348\u1320\u122b\u1278\u12cd\u1362\u00bbmeaning \"Elias on the sky, Yidnekackew on land, God created them in tribute.\"\n\n\n== Academy ==\nIn 2017, Saint George finished construction on Yidnekahew Tessema Sport Academy, the club's first youth academy, in the city of Bishoftu (Debre Zeyit). The academy is named after Yidnekahew Tessema, a former Saint George and Ethiopian national team player who rose to prominence in African football as CAF president (1972 -1987). The academy, built at a cost of over 60 million ETB, lies on 24,000 hectares of land and is expected to accommodate over 100 youth players at one time. The facilities at the academy include: two football pitches, a cafeteria, a conference center, a game room, dressing rooms,a modern medical center, a gym, and  dormitories.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\nSaint George plays its home matches at Addis Ababa Stadium, also known as Yidnekachew Tessema Stadium. Due to it being the largest international standard stadium in the area, the ground is shared with many other Addis Ababa-based clubs including Ethiopian Coffee, Defense, Addis Ababa City, EEPCO, and formerly CBE SA.\nSince 1999, fee-paying supporters have owned St. George. In November 2007, the club had finished raising funds and would begin construction of a new stadium. Budgeted at 312 million Birr, 80% of the cost would be covered by Sheik Mohammed Al Amoudi with the balance to be contributed by the club's supporters.\n\n\n== Honors ==\n\n\n=== Domestic ===\n\n\n==== League ====\nEthiopian Premier League: 291950, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1971, 1975, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017\n\n\n==== Cups ====\nEthiopian Cup: 121952, 1953, 1957, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1993, 1999, 2009, 2011, 2016Ethiopian Super Cup: 161985, 1986, 1987,1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2017\n\n\n==== Regional ====\nAddis Ababa City Cup: 62009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2017, 2019\n\n\n== Performance in CAF competitions ==\nCAF Champions League: 9 appearances\nAfrican Cup of Champions Clubs: 10 appearances\nCAF Confederation Cup: 1 appearance2012 \u2013 First RoundCAF Cup: 1 appearance2002 \u2013 Second RoundCAF Cup Winners' Cup: 3 appearances1975 \u2013 First Round\n1978 \u2013 Preliminary Round\n1994 \u2013 Second Round\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== First-team squad ===\nAs of 12 January 2020\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

          "The man who met us at the entrance tried to overcharge us to be a tour guide, so we just visited the museum by ourselves. It's small but worth a visit by itself, with some interesting Ethiopian religious objects and paintings. Fortunately there was a power cut and we were given",
          "Well, I have to say the St Georges Cathederal is my favourite place that I have found on this Earth. The first time I went to this Church was with my Queen and we received a blessing there and it then became the Centre in my life. The vibrations at this place are very powerfull",

          "The St. George's Cathedral was the only real touristy thing I did in Addis as I was there for business but it was highly worth the visit to get a glimpse of the local culture and see this beautiful place. DO the tour for a small fare and grab a coffee beforehand at Tomoco's in",
          "It is an interesting visit but the great thing about it it is if one can hear the instruments played during ceremonies. There is a museum about the Orthodox Church and Emperors but the amazing thing about this museum is that you have to visit it with a candle that they give you",
          "Get the tour from the archdeacon! Great history, with frescoes depicting everything from St. George's victory to Haile Selassie's speech given to the League of Nations in the 1930s. There's a museum with more history regarding both the Orthodox Church as well as the emperors.",

          "I really enjoyed visiting the Cathedral when it was alive on a Sunday. It's a short walk to the top of the hill from Piazza, and well worth it. There were some excellent photo opportunities and a chance to witness the everyday religious lives of Ethiopians. It's helpful to",

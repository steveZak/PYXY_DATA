        "wiki": "The Museum aan de Stroom (MAS; Dutch for: Museum by the River) is a museum located along the river Scheldt in the Eilandje district of Antwerp, Belgium. It opened in May 2011 and is the largest museum in Antwerp.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1998 the Antwerp city council decided to build the museum at the Hanzestedenplaats. On 14 September 2006 the first brick of the building was laid. In 2010 museum objects arrived from various other museums like the Ethnographic Museum and the Maritime Museum, which both ceased to exist. The museum opened for the public on 17 May 2011.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe 60-metre-high (200 ft) MAS was designed by Neutelings Riedijk Architects. The fa\u00e7ade is made of Indian red sandstone and curved glass panel construction. It is an example of postmodern Art Deco architecture. The MAS houses 470,000 objects, most of which are kept in storage. The first visitor's gallery is the \"visible store\", which contains 180,000 items. The building is located on the spot where the Hanzehuis used to stand. International merchants worked and resided at the Hanzehuis. In the nineteenth century a fire destroyed the building.\n\n\n== Collection and exhibitions ==\nThe central focus of the MAS is Antwerp and its connection to the world. The MAS collection ranges from maritime objects which document international trade and shipping, to the history, art and culture of the port city of Antwerp and to art and culture from Europe, Africa, America, Asia and Oceania. The MAS develops thematic exhibitions which connect local and global culture, art and history. The museum is committed to informing the public using new media and immersive presentations. The museum was internationally awarded for its MAS IN YOUNG HANDS initiative, which involves youngsters from very diverse backgrounds as event organizers and curators.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website Media related to Museum Aan de Stroom at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Located along the River Scheldt of the old harbour district this gigantic Lego-like structure is visually stunning. There is an extensive art exhibit inside & free panoramic views from the roof. The curved windows give the illusion you're looking at tubes from the outside. If",
          "Whether you enjoy wandering around a museum looking at all the exhibitions or just want to get a good view this museum caters for both. It has it's permanent exhibitions on display and has different temporary exhibitions. You can have something to eat there at either the ground",
          "I have been to the museum to view the city from the top terrace which is really easy to reach. There are many exhibitions running at the same time and the view is amazing (and free).",
          "A fascinating building which houses a collection of museums with a slight focus on the Port of Antwerp, but has collections as varied as pre-Columbian art and the future of food supplies in cities.",
          "This remarkable building-museum opened just a few years ago, and is already a landmark in Antwerp, together with our Cathedral, Rubens' House and the Havenhuis by Zaha Hadid. This MAS (Museum At the Stream) houses a little bit of everything about Antwerp's past 1000 years, as",
          "Great Museum but most impressive is the top floor where you can see all of Antwerp. Can get a little windy but it is free :)",
          "At the 10th level of the MAS you can enjoy a nice open view over Antwerp. As it is free of charge, there is no reason not to do it. You can reach the top level with automatic stairs, so no much effort to do to reach the top",
          "We didn't even go into the museums, only the roof. Gives you a great view of the city. Be sure to look down to the square beneath.",
          "You've got two options here - just head past the ticket booths, up the escalators straight to the top to view the Antwerp skyline, or stop off on your way and check out the exhibits. I looked at a few of the free ones which were really good. The rooftop is open from early until",
          "We got tickets for both museums. Loved the Red Star Muse - but found that doing both was probably too much in one day. I didn't have have a clue what was in the musuem but we were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the exhibitions. Especially liked the Le Corbusier one.",
          "The house looks fantastically from the outside but the exhibitions are actually very boring. Not worth the trip.",
          "I can't say the theme of the museum is one of my top favorites, but the fact that it had many interactive things made it more interesting.",
          "MAS (Museum at the Stream) is one of the nicest museums I have seen, and I have seen many. The museum is a stacked 10 storey building were you ascent from floor to floor passing 8 different exhibitions from which half is temporary. Entering an exhibition is entering a world of",
          "The building itself is an attraction: hard to describe it though you can see the photos at the top of this page. Anyhow, its in a canal basin around 15 minutes walk fro the old centre of Antwerp and worth the walk. When you go in - unless you want to see an exhibition - ignore",
          "Thuis museum is worth visiting if only tor the view from the rooftop at the 10th floor. The exhibitionisme were okay.",
          "From the top of MAS you can see all of Antwerp. It is totally free to visit the view point. But if you want to visit the museum on your way up this cost money. Not sure how much...",
          "Went here on a friday afternoon. Each floor has its own exhibition. They all have different themes, so you go from \"parties\" to \" boats\" to \"buddha\". Which is a little bit of a shame, because although the small exhibitions are interesting, but it can be too much different",
          "The multi-level museum provides wonderful views of the city and many different levels of historical and city-oriented exhibits. few of the exhibits seemed to offer written commentary in English. On our visit we started at the top level and worked our way down. We did not have a",
          "Many people come to the MAS for the free observation deck on top of the 10th floor. It is NOT going to give you a view of historical Antwerp; it will give you a view of the modern windmills in the distance, the ferris wheel, the immediate harbor underneath it. It is still",
          "We just took the advantage on the height of this building instead of entering the internal part of the museum. The top floor of this museum offered free panoramic view of River Schelde and the surrounding area and the artistic value of the building itself was with the curved",
          "My daughter lives in Antwerp and so I have been able to visit here a few times. A few things I have done/learned about this place. I downloaded the QR reader app so I can learn a lot about each exhibit. It really enhances the experience. I don\u2019t try to see the whole museum at",
          "We didn\u2019t visit the museum itself but took advantage of the free attraction; the panoramic views at the very top of the building. Definitely worth a visit if you are walking around Antwerp.",
          "You can head to the roof for an outdoor panoramic view. It can be windy at the top! It\u2019s free to enter the museum for the view deck but you need to pay to see the museum. You can also use the toilet without paying. The building is amazing and you can see for miles from the roof.",
          "Landmark of Antwerp, it was a memorable trip indeed. Awesome landmark\ud83d\udc4dyou should visit this when your in Antwerp.",
          "Just a stunning piece of architecture. Definitely worth the time to go up to the top around sunset breathtaking",
          "If you want to see how river Schelde is coming into Antwerp the MAS rooftop is a place to visit for free.",
          "Interesting place to visit. It is a modern dynamic museum and you can even see the city from each floor. To be visited for sure.",
          "Went to visit the museum with a friend of mine. I was looking forward and had looked a lot beforehand on the MAS\u2019s homepage. I really had high expectations. It did not seem to be the most exiting place in Antwerp-region. Super nice building - nice architecture and nice view",
          "We traveled to Belgium for the beer and chocolate. We were very surprised and impressed with this museum. Lots to see, we wish we had had more time to explore. Another trip?",
          "Excellent display of art and culture. Great way to get around using the excalator and the view from up is phenomenon. Do take a thick coat because it's chilly at the top. Some exhibitions are free as is the panorama view",
          "I absolutely lover this building and it looks really nice on the skyline. It is so different and unique - one to see!",
          "A really enjoyable place to hang out, meet friends, see interesting art work and gaze down on the city from the free 10th floor roof top panorama.",
          "Each floor of this museum has different themes, the design of each area being totally different. The views over Antwerp are 360 degrees.",
          "went here for a quick stop to see a lovely view of the city. We were with a big group, and didnt visit the museum but did go on the roof terrace to see the city!",
          "Although there are exhibitions on most floors we went straight for the free panorama at the top. Lots of interesting art on the way up as well as great views once you\u2019re there. At the top there\u2019s plastic up to about six feet high with one hole on each side for you to take",
          "The rooftop is a beautiful place for watching the skyline of Antwerp. Free entrance to the terrace. Extended opening hours to this part of the museum. The other floors have free entrance every last Wednesday of the month.",
          "Our hotel suggested we \u201cwalk\u201d to the top. So we did. The walk was automated by escalators for 9 out of 10 floors which made it very easy. And the view was absolutely amazing. Did I mention it was sunset. And it\u2019s free entry. Yep. Get off your arse and check it out.",
          "This museum there isn't a lot of things to see inside but the view from the top floor is stunning. It's worth it the walk until the top to see Antwerp.",
          "We went to the MAS museum just as it was closing, so we forfeited going around every department of the museum and went straight up the stairs to the rooftop which is free to do. The view is by far one of the best views of the city you\u2019ll get, must go for any photographer.",
          "A 7 floors museum which must be visited. It is a great place to see in Antwerp. A nice idea of combining a few museums in the same building and the view of the city from the top is brilliant.",
          "A nice museum, can be visited with the family. Better to go with public transport rather than own car.",
          "Like so many others comments I have to join the general verdict: THE VIEW is worth coming for FREE, the exhibitions even if they were free (not 10\u20ac) are not worth my time. The exhibitions (especially the INSTINCT but also other) are very POORLY CURATED - a general eclectic",
          "Visited in January 2019. Really interesting building from the outside and inside. To visit each of the exhibitions you have to go up the building by escalator, there is one exhibition per floor. At the top there is a rooftop viewing platform called \u201cPanorama\u201d where you can get",
          "Very nice museum with free panoramic vieuw over the city and the harbour. If you enter the museum you can take the escallator or elevator to the rooftop for free where you can make nice panoramic photo's of the city and harbour. Also the museum is a very nice museum to visit for",
          "Such a good place to spend the afternoon. Every level is so different , I dont normally get blown away by a museum but it's that good . You wont be dissapointed . And you can go the the roof level for great photos free of charge but would be a great shame not to walk through",
          "The museum is a bit confusing with a different exhibition on each floor, the upside is it makes for larger variety. The entrance price is low and the building is very nice to visit. Each floor gives a nice view of the city with curved windows in which you can stand. The best",
          "Very interesting and modern museum of Antwerp history which located in very nice building with viewing platform on the roof. Every last Wednesday of the month is free entrance. Near the museum is located souvenir shop.",
          "It's always a pleasure to show visitors and tourists this beautiful museum with a rich and diverse collection. A must do is taking the stairs to the roof where you have a great view (60m high) over the whole city.",
          "Even though we haven\u2019t visited the museum we have climbed up to have a view of the city. Tour has escalators which makes it easy to go up. You will have excellent view of whole city.",
          "Looking at things to do in Antwerp, going to the top of the MAS building was one of the options. Easy to get to, it is free to access without entering the museum area on each floor. Ten floors, well laid out with escalators on each floor, being set at 90 degrees to the last, you",
          "We visited here late in the day so only had time to go to the viewing galleries but it was worth it for the aerial views of Antwerp. Unfortunately the day we visited was very windy so the top external viewing platform was closed but we still got stunning views from the other",
          "Although we didn't go into the museum itself, it was great to be able to go to the top to get a view of the city for free. You have to go up a bunch of escalators to get there but it's worth it. The building itself looks rather interesting as well.",
          "Walking to the MAS (Museum At the Schelde river) is certainly a must, when visiting Antwerp. Take the time to go to the top floor (using the escalators): you will have a magnificent view over the city and the harbour. The MAS also house a number of fixed and variable",
          "We did the free tour with The Legends (Very good) and they recommended to visit this museum. Indeed it was worth it. Do not forget to stand completely at/in the corner to have a strange feeling. The museum has a lot of very interesting vieuws on the city and on Antwerp.",
          "We certainly recommend this great museum for all who want to know more about Belgian + Flemish history. Tip: if you have no time to visit the exhibition, take a stunning look from the top level of this museum (accessible free of charge).",
          "We had the most pleasant experience here gathering with some clients and enjoying the exceptional architecture, views and food in this new Antwerp museum. The museum itself is is very specialized and a tour sense only if you are interested in the maritime history of the country",
          "To go in Antwerp and not to visit MAS - it is not serious! Go there to see the expositions ..and go to the top. The view is incredible and unutterable.",
          "The building has ten floors. In top you\u2019ll have a nice 360 degrees panorama and you can admire the city. There are some free-entry exhibitions.",
          "concerts, events that take occasionally are really good. It has a nice roof and also has some place for studying but a little bit noisy to study and concentrate.",
          "Although the set up of the museum is very contemporary , the subjects on display are very bizar. It feels like the city had to empty an attic and did not know what to do with the content of it. The section with the history of the port was the only interesting part for me. Try",
          "Went about 1745hrs.just in time for sun set! Awesome view. Free for sky tower access. But entry fee applies for museum. Worth a visit if around. 360 view of surrounding area.",
          "You can enter for free if you just want to go to the rooftop for the city panorama. Definately worth doing this - the views are stunning - you get 360 degree views of the city and on a clear day you can see for miles.",
          "Only visited the panorama. It looks like a great museum and would love to visit properly next time. Free to go up the escalator to the top deck.",
          "This very attractive building houses a very thoughtful set of exhibitions. What is on show is thematically arranged, topical and presented with innovation and flair. Friendly service and informative staff help to make this a memorable experience. We were especially impressed by",
          "Massive exhibition with great view from the panoramic level. Nice presentation of Antwerp.. History in art , very unique and unusual. Nice weather a lot of positive emotions.",
          "Lots of different exhibitions, permanent and temporary. With each floor you visit (in total there are 8, and a panorama roof), the view gets more and more spectacular. We almost spent 4 hours in the museum because we really wanted to see everything. Also very convenient: Storm",
          "great architecture, nice view on the marina and river scheld. The collection in the different rooms have different themes. I was particularly impressed by the collection of South American gold art from the inca times. You do not have to travel to Bogota for this , you can also",
          "The location on 't Eilandje is great, and the architecture of this building is worthwhile a visit. The views from the roof are nice and can be enjoyed without entering the museum. I found the exhibitions however lacking a clear purpose and structure. Some were traditional",
          "The museum shows different collections, check out the website of MAS to see what is going on. The building itself is beautiful if you like modern architecture. You can go to the roof by escalator, seeing some artwork and get a view of the city for free. It is really nice. There",
          "Great architecture and view of the museum on the dock and city of antwerpen. Collections are eclectic But not so interresting. In certain floor, every single explanation are in Dutsh... not even an english translation...",
          "We came here for the view over the city. I think the building is also of interest. The view of Antwerp is on the 10th floor and the route is clearly marked. You take the escalators up to the top. On route there are some snippets of the type of art showcased in the museum. There",
          "This museum has it all: various interesting exhibitions, amazing architecture and possibly the best view on Antwerp you can find. I have already visited it many times and will return again!",
          "The Museum aan de Stroom offers unbeatable panoramic views of Antwerp city. Primarily because of this, it is well worth a visit. There are also exhibits onsite, which adds to the overall experience here.",
          "This museum is worth to visit! The spectacular view over the water is just amazing. Also, very nearby there are many restaurants and coffee bars and it\u2019s just lovely to visit this area.",
          "Museum spread over 5 floors - exhibitions vary throughout the year but in my opinion not really very interesting However, go to the rooftop on the 10th floor for great views of the city",
          "Some cool piece of architecture. We did not visit the museum itself but just made use of the viewing platform - excellent (and for free).",
          "While we (two couples) were under the impression from honey who visited previously that the entire museum was devoted to a Holocaust exhibit, we were at first disappointed to learn the exhibit changes every four months. The current exhibit is Antwerp-centric. Antwerp prides",
          "We did not visit the museum, but we did take the escalators to the top for the view of Antwerp. It is a little out of the center, but worth the walk",
          "As I said is worth to visit building ,lovely view ,plenty to see and try out future gadgets ,can't fault it ,even the unfriendly guy at the ticket area didn't ruin it for us ,",
          "There a wide selection of interesting and ancient artifacts on display throughout the several floors of the building and can easily spend an hour or so viewing the exhibitions. If you only want to visit the Panorama on the 10th floor there is no charge however if you want to",
          "We caught the number 7 tram, which drops you off very close to the Museum. You can, if you wish, just use the museum as a way of getting a spectacular panoramic view across Antwerp as access to the roof is free. The museum itself is a bargain at 5 Euros (we oldies only paid 3",
          "My heart bleeds every time I think of those brilliant collections being crammed away, \"jailed\" in plain sight. Museums have to go with the flow of changing times and it's an okay building, but it's w\u00e0y too small. Previously the collections were housed in separate museums that",
          "We took the tour inside, got to see all the exhibitions. The museum has a lot of rooms with different collections and they present them in a very educational and interesting way. If you go up all the floors you end up on the roof terrace with a great view of the city of Antwerp",
          "We went after the museum itself was closed but the rooftop is open till late. The building itself is very interesting and the views on top are great. Free to go to the top, worth the visit!",
          "This museum is well worth a visit. Only 4 levels open at present but the displays are well presented. The view at top was great too.",
          "A must do if you visit Antwerp! This modern museum has a free rooftop with an amazing view on the City of Antwerp. You will find this landmark in the middle of the new district: Het Eilandje. Lot's of nice bars and restaurants in this area!",
          "We didn\u2019t actually go in the museum but we did visit the shop which has some very nice books and bits and pieces. The escalators around the side of the building to see the view from the top we\u2019re fun and we enjoyed our visit.",
          "We went to this museum as a family, not really knowing anything about it, and really enjoyed it. There are many floors and just enough to see on each level without getting bored and wanting to move on. We initially only wanted to get to the top to see the view but decided to pay",
          "This museum has temporary exhibitions and permanent exhibitions. You need to look at their website if you like the subject or not. Anyway the things on display won't dissapoint you. They retain high quality. On top of the MAS ( the name of the musea) you have a nice view of the",
          "If you like to have a nice overlook of the city, consider to go to the Mas Panoramic View. It\u2018s totaly free and if you like you also can visit the Mas Miseum ( not free). Step by Step you go higher and from each level you have a better view. I would say it\u2018s a must to-do thing",
          "MAS (Museum aan de Stroom/Museum by the River) is a fantastic new museum in Antwerp. Intriguing modern architecture and based on the River Scheldt. About 7 floors each of which have a different cultural exhibition or exposition. When I was there, there was an excellent",
          "Interesting architecture, each level contain a different exhibit a different theme, one floor had all items behind fenced area, dark lighting, and too much stuffed that was not conducive to appreciation. A great panoramic view of the city from the terrace, which ticket is not",
          "A surprisigly entartaining museum with an interesting surrounding area. Each floor had their own exhibition about different topics such as religion, sailing and consumption. The exhibitions were different, few focused on issues, raised awareness and made us think, few only",
          "So easy to get to, location fantastic alongside the marina. There were many exhibitions and museums within some free and also a cafe. However we were pushed for time so took advantage of the escalators to go to the viewing platform on the top. Views over the city brilliant, I",
          "The \"cherry\" its on his last floor.. with the view to the entire city.. but in between you get the opportunity to see amazing museums and experience different exibitions.. its near the canals and a few streets ahead you can go to the red light district of Antwerpen.",
          "The MAS museum is definitely \u201cmust-visit\u201d place! It\u2019s a great 9 floors building with a great collection, activities and just breath-taking panorama view on top. Panorama is open to public till midnight (10 pm from autumn till spring) and it is free entrance. Travelers can also",
          "I am not normally one for visiting museums so I was a bit sceptical about visiting MAS. In fact all I was really interested in was going to the top floor for the views. We thought you had to buy a ticket to get to the top floor. No! The views are free, no need to buy tickets.",
          "Free access to this spectacular 360 degrees view across Antwerp from 10th floor. The building too is an architectural delight and sits proudly on the edge of the water.",
          "I was with my one year old girl, easy to go by elevator if you leave the pram to security. It was amazing experience for both of us. Nice panorama's view.",
          "The building is interesting, the view from the top is OK no more, but the whole thing seems to lack focus. Various exhibitions, with no guiding idea or focus. It seems like they first built the building and than started to think what to do with it.",
          "Interesting variety of exhibits in a fantastic space. Signage placement was awkwardly low, and some exhibits didn\u2019t have signage in English, which was disappointing. Nonethless, we enjoyed our time there very much. Not crowded on a Tuesday mid-morning, which was quite nice.",
          "The MAS is beautifully located next to the water and has great views from every floor, but the panoramic terrace on the roof is obviously the most impressive. 6 floors with different exhibitions and a completely specific setup make it appear as if you were visiting 6 different",
          "We always bring visitors coming to Belgium to visit this museum even just going to the rooftop and enjoy the view of the city is a great experience, you can see part of the history of Antwerpen while taking the electric stairs up or down",
          "Walkable distance from the river front, accessible through tram as well from the centre. Closeby is the old port with so many old vessels",
          "We visited this fascinating museum/iconic landmark a few days ago. The building itself is worth visiting in its own right and possesses a fine view of the city from its roof top gallery, for those possessed of little time and or money the trip via escalator to the top floor is",
          "We went in to see the Michaelina exhibition (which was excellent), and went to the rooftop for a view over Antwerp. There's so much more to see though.. the museum is huge and offers various (changing) exhibitions at the same time. I plan on going back.",
          "The number of positive reviews here speaks for itself. So very briefly, a well laid out and changing museum space, with free and paid exhibits on different floors, all reached by a set of escalators separate from each museum hall. These themselves lead to a 10th floor 360",
          "Fantastic modern architecture, with a public walking way with escalators around the building to the 10th floor. Free access until 23:40 (not midnight !!!). The museum is brand new, and the top floors (4-5-6) should not be missed (on the city, etc)",
          "This museum has something for everybody. The architecture, especially the rounded glass elements on the facade are intriguing. Check-in was friendly and efficient. Remember to ask for a brochure. We started with the view from the top floor and made our way down from floor to",
          "An attractive museum building with a top terrace overlooking the city and the port. Interesting displays of the city history, old artifacts \"in storage\" and an extra ordinary female painter from the 1700-teen century. Good cafe with food and drinks on the ground floor.",
          "Had been here before by myself a few years ago and wanted to bring the family. Several different themed exhibitions. All of them weren\u2019t for me or the family but enough good content and the building itself along with the views are well worth checking this museum out.",
          "Last year we had 2 days in Antwerp and had time to do the escalator ride up to the panoramic view. This year we returned and on a hot July day spent a very happy 3 hours in the cool galleries in the middle of the day. Highlights were the really ancient American treasures and the",
          "In a prime location on the river and banks...MAS museum offers a panoramic view of Antwerp from its panorama terrace And has different galleries there to see a wide range of art.",
          "Three reasons to visit the MAS: 1) free panorama view over the city, harbor and beyond; 2) Multiple arts exhibits that change regularly; 3) Beautiful environment where you can enjoy a drink, a good meal, the architecture and the atmosphere.",
          "With 9 floors of galleries, you would think we\u2019d walk through at least one. But the graceful glide up to each floor and the stroll around the corner of the building to the next escalator all the way to the 10th floor rooftop observation deck zoned us into a smooth, passive state",
          "A modern building with free access to the roof area. You do not have to pay unless you are visiting the exibitions. Also has a cafe. A bit of a walk from the city, but a tram stops outside...great view from the roof",
          "Brilliant idea from the architect, very smart design. And amazing location too. Especially like those giant curved windows. They give a kind of vintage touch.",
          "Beautyful building in the center of Antwerp, next to the docks with lot of levels to explore. At the top of the building you have a great view over the city center. A must see!",
          "The view from the top of the museum is incredible, and you don\u2019t need to pay to get up there (What I love the most)!! And there is very nice Exhibitions all the time!",
          "This is one of the most fascinating museums I have been to in awhile. Each floor has its own exhibit and the views as you go up just keep getting better and better. Well worth the price of admission.",
          "Nice museum with a Free rooftop terras. Great views on city, harbour and river Schelde. A must do in Antwerp!",
          "Each floor with differing interest. Shipping section and pre Americas were both great. Top floor is free to access but the views are well worth the visit.",
          "Fantastic bright ten storey building in the dockland area of Antwerp. Has to be visited - each floor has its own art exhibitions. These are chargeable but MAS is free. Escalators to each floor. Top tenth floor has a magnificent view all round of Antwerp and its port. A towering",
          "A great museum and building with fantastic views at the top. There are a number of floors with some great information on Antwerp\u2019s history and general world history too. Each floor has a quirky entrance. I definitely learned a lot and this was the most informative and",
          "Since the opening in 2011 the MAS has become a fixture in the city. Although it took a while for Antwerpians to get used to the building's modern architecture they now can't even begin to imagine the city without it.The museum has played a vital role in the neighborhood' s",
          "MAS is a fairly new museum. It has some interesting collections and has special exhibitions as well...one of which we were there to see. The building itself is striking. You take a series of escalators to get to the different galleries and all the way to the top floor (actually,",
          "Our family enjoyed the MAS. We immediately bought a day pass and headed to the top floor. We took in the view of the city and was told we could see Brussels from our vantage point. We then worked our way down floor to floor viewing the exhibits. We found the themes to each",
          "First time for us to visit the Museum after so many visits to Antwerp and must say we were very impressed .",
          "You should start at the top of the building, great view over Antwerp and visit after that each level with different exhibitions.",
          "MAS looks like a stack of shipping containers crossed with a warehouse. Its light and modern with great views at each level accessed by escalators but you need to be able to climb 2 flights of stairs for the panorama at the top. I Liked the use of modern photos side by side",
          "This building is super-cool. Really interesting design with thousands of silver hand sculptures covering the outside. The route to the top takes you round a series of escalators with some interesting art and nice chill out areas with great views. The best bit though (I didn\u2019t",
          "Beautiful paintings and pieces, it is different than other museums that I visited. For English speaker, you have to scan a bar-code to know more about what are you looking at",
          "great looking building lots of different things going on from school children work shops to exhibitions and the panoramic view of antwerp which is Worth the visit alone",
          "This museum makes for a nice visit, you can select which floor(s) to roam and pay accordingly, in case you're in the mood for just a smaller portion of culture. The building is an attraction in its own right, and there were some nifty photographs on display in the public areas.",
          "Just impressive in so many ways. This new museum is a knockout. Beautiful redstone building and inside is great with great tapestry of information to give you a great inside look at the history of Antwerp. Then a bonus is the top floor which gives you a great view of the city.",
          "It is free to go to the top of the 10 levels to get the best view of the city and there are escalators up to last level. There is art on every level and a gift shop as you leave.",

          "The MAS Museum in Antwerp is one of Antwerps more recently opened museums. It is big however one doesn;t need much time to visit it. The view on top is really worht the visit and your senses will be activated on your way up...",
          "It has in total of ten floors. Artifacts from all over the world. I would suggest to take a complete day to see this place. As it's massive. And lots of interesting things to know n learn. It's so huge that one floor will never be crowded. Awesome to know world history.",
          "Went there on a Monday and unfortunately they are not open on Mondays. Shame could not get to go the top as was looking forward to seeing Antwerp from the top",
          "Very cool experience going to the roof. Wonderful view of Antwerp and its ports. Escalators and unique interior make for a neat experience.",
          "The Architecture of this building is worth the visit. Plus, the view of Antwerp from the roof top IS TRULY over the top. Breathtaking views from the glass as you spiral up the building. Plus, a study hall in action for students. Take the enjoyable Walk to MAS. A must!",
          "We spotted this off the toy train and went to visit. Can get a seniors ticket. lovely arty and modern but maybe just not what we expected. Maybe just showing the history and multicultural aspects of Antwerp. We had hoped for more paintings as they had large poster type",
          "Fantastic place to visit and very reasonably priced. A great day out. Staff very helpful, even taking me up to the floor it starts on and all the way back down in a lift. Not to be missed on your visit. Incredible building and views",
          "We spent several hours wandering around this place. Each floor has something different to view. Really loved the maritime floor. Lots of very different & interesting displays.",

          "Nice structure in the middle of the old port. Inside you find a museum but you could go on the top of the palace for free. There you could find a very nice view of Antwerp",

          "Visited this museum on a tour of Antwerp, colossal size and well worth a visit lots of visitors sitting around enjoying the view and the surrounding port..",
          "This weird building is a must visit in Antwerp, you have the changing exhibitions on each floor, but you can also get free entry to the top floor an enjoy the view. Too bad that the highest floor is not accessible by an elevator for people with disabilities",
          "Don\u2019t miss a floor. So many great things about this to explore for people of all ages. There\u2019s also spectacular view of the city.",
          "You could spend hours in this museum.,or you you could climb 10 floors on an escalator to the roof to see a fabulous view of Antwerp. The view is free, open until midnight, everyday. We didn't have time to look round the museum, but we would definitely go back.",
          "Always wanted to visit this museum. Fair price and all the way up is a great view over the city, the water, the marina. Amazing! Next time sunset!",
          "We did not view any of the exhibits, though there were a few going on while we were there that I would have liked to have taken in but we were short for time. You can enter the building and go to the observation deck for free and get a spectacular view of a lovely city that is",
          "We took our grandchildren to this museum and they loved seeing the ships and the view from the top. It was a cold rainy day but it was still enjoyable",
          "Fantastic panoramic views but be prepared to go up what seems like a million escalators and last 2 flights stairs to get to level 10 for it. The glass has a cut out circle on each side perfect to take a picture through. And it\u2019s free! I didn\u2019t visit any of the art exhibits here",
          "Definitely the one museum you have to visit in Antwerp. Every exposition was very different and the architecture (both inside and out) of the building is incredible. A new and unique take on a museum and very inexpensive (2.7 euros for students). There were interactive",
          "We traveled by tram from the centre (helpful chap at Tourist Info in train station) and was pleased to get a teacher's discount (ITIC card) to get in - so do ask! The museum is lovely: well-designed with fab views and lots to take in on the way up. Wobbly stools and super views.",
          "Free panoramic views from the top. Art displays are an optional extra and worth paying for. We were a family with kids and so chose just a few floors to explore as their interest was limited and certainly there was too much to take in. Sustainable Cities was very well done.",
          "Museum Aan de Stroom (MAS) is based in beautiful building made of red bricks and curved glass. Walking your way up to the viewpoint on the 10th floor give a unique experience whereby the gorgeous city of Antwerp reveals itself slowly. There are plenty of interesting exhibitions",
          "Great views from the platform at the top of this building on level 10. Some of the floors were closed to allow new exhibitions to be prepared but floors 5-9 were open. I particularly enjoyed the pre Columbian America with fantastic masks and pottery. Polynesian/ Papa New Guinea",
          "Often special exhibitions in addition to the usual collection. The view from the roof top (access free) is worthwhile, if you don't have time to view some of the floors.",
          "The MAS is not only a stunning building but 6/7 floors of different and changing exhibitions from the port history to 3rd world culture. We loved it as each floor brought new and interesting facts. However the best bit is the building itself especially the views from the top.",
          "The view from the top floor is free. To see the museum collection cost a few euros. The collection is varied and two of the floors were closed. There are free lockers in the basement. It was raining when we got to the top floor, so did not go outside to find out what the",
          "Nice building, nice surroundings. I can took picture from above. But when I was there, the 9th and 10th floor was closed. So I only can take pics from 8th floor",
          "Nice collection of an historical ethnographical museum well worth the 5 euro price. I particularly appreciated the south american and sail/trade section. Only downside is that most of the text was in dutch although with in app it seems you could get some info as well. Some part",
          "The building and the surrounding are absolutely stunning. You can use the escalators to go to the top of the building for free. The views are great and they change at every corner! The museum doesn't have a real collection apart from a small but beautiful Pre Colombian Art",
          "We recommend starting at the top of this interesting building and working your way down as the views from the top are marvellous! The exhibitions, especially the one about the port, are fascinating and you should probably allow several hours to do it justice",
          "MAS is a spectacular building in Antwerp. Not only its look but it is also worth to explore the exhibitions inside. I loved the fact that there were spots for students to study there, with tables facing the skyline of the city.",

          "Situated in a very pleasant area at the Bonaparte Willem docks. I only went to the top for Free for the view. \u20ac8 entrance otherwise I think. Other exhibitions you also had to pay for.",
          "We did not visit the museum itself but used the elevators on the outside of the building to ascend the nine floors to the roof for a great view of the city. Love the architecture of the building itself as well.",
          "Good for an hour to kill. Not a bad view from top. Free for a few areas and the scenic platform. Recommend.",
          "We didn\u2019t visit the museums on each floor but getting to the top is free. It was quite cold while we were there so the glass views really warmed us up! And the view from the top is really great \ud83d\udc4d",
          "We visited over the new year holidays and unfortunately we didn't see the museum proper due to holiday hours. However, the observation levels were open to us and they were well worth the visit. Great views.",
          "As if the grounds and external architecture aren't enough to amaze you,the layout, displays and activities are awesome. I was completely thrilled.",
          "The MAS offers a fantastic view all over Antwerp from the rooftop, which is accessible for free. I would recommend to visit this building once by day and once by night, as the illumination during the night gives a complete new impression and kind of \"second\" face to the facade.",
          "A really interesting museum with a variety of different exhibitions that change throughout the year. Most museums in Antwerp are free on the last Wednesday of each month. There is a platform at the top which offers a great view of the port of Antwerp.",
          "I went to see the moon trough a giant telescope!! This was a special night on the top of the museum! It was organized by the observatory of Hove (Antwerp). I enjoyed the city lights of Antwerp to!",

          "You should visit MAS if you want to have a panoramic view on the city and both sides of the river. The entrance to the top is for free.",
          "An impressive and imposing building...........but lacking in any exhibits that excite - or even interest. A curator who knows what their job is would dramatically improve the experience, and the building deserves it.",
          "We saw this building from the waterfront when we went across the river. Quite a different architecture and an attraction for the tourists.",
          "This is by one of the harbours and an interesting modern building just by itself. You can go up to the viewing platform without paying for the Museum, but they do have a variety of exhibitions which can be interesting.",
          "The MAS (Museum at the River) is a recent addition to Antwerp's museum scene. It is an architectural beauty located in the old docks, but still xithin easy walking to the historic centre. At the top you can enjoy en excellent panorama. Every floor has its own topic from (old)",
          "Visiting the MAS means exploring the building from the bottom to the top. As you make your way up, you discover that the museum is much greater than the building. The museum has a large collection, about 500,000 items, including artworks and utensils, which will tell you stories",
          "This is a new beautiful museum. This you can't miss on your trip to Antwerp. Has free storage collections and Best view of City from it's 10 the floor. If you are interested in history of city inludings it's diamond trade and and it's ports , take a paid tour from 3rd to 8th",
          "Due solely to lack of time I didn't visit the museum exhibitions themselves but at no charge one can ascend inside by flights of escalators to the roof of the building. From there through safety screens (with small apertures to allow clear photography) one can get breathtaking",
          "Interesting concept combining a museum with interesting exhibitions with nice quotes of contemporary Belgian poets and a nice terrace from which you may enjoy the view over the whole city.",
          "One of the most beautiful small museums, with a view deck on the top floor (that costs nothing) and a very interesting (paid) exploration of Antwerp's (maritime) history. If you're tired of portraits and Rubens and other Golden Age paintings which look all the same, this is the",
          "Fantastic views (and the top level panorama view - open air; be prepared!) is free. Each level offers a great view from this very modern 8 floor museum with waving glass windows intended to simulate waves. Each floor offers a different kind of exhibit. One simulates museum",
          "The MAS is not only an interesting museum with changing exhibitions, the building itself is worth a look. On the walls of the museum are tiny hands, the typical symbol of Antwerp. You can enter the museum for free, but you have to pay to see the exhibitions. A must do when",
          "This part of Antwerp which has a lot of new development is very interesting. This building which is probably 10 floors gives an impressive view of the whole city. You can even access it with a pram or a stroller.",
          "This is a unique experience, the building is amazing, the displays mind consuming, and interesting,somenot to everyone\u2019s taste, but it is a modern art experience. Very educational and thought provoking",
          "This is a museum , every floor something different, also sometimes temporary exhibition High building if you are on the top floor you can see the harbour and a view over Antwerp you can see how many churches there are To go to top is for free Downstairs you have souvenirs shop",
          "The MAS building is in the middle of the old docks area with several adjacent bar/cafes. When we visited there were fascinating/crazy living art presentations on each floor and magnificent views from the top.",
          "There's so much artwork to see here, it's highly impressive. Although there isn't so much room in here, theres a very large amount of things you can see. In matter of fact, while thinking back of my visit there I'm still perplexed at the large amount of works they have for",
          "MAS did not impressed me in the first sight in terms of architecture. However, it turned out to be amazing when I got inside. At each floor, different exhibition themes can be found and all are interesting. Finally, when I reached top of the building, fantastic view of the city.",
          "Good spot to spend time away from the hussle and bustle of the city. Good exhibits and excellent views of city.",
          "We went to the museum to go and have a look at the views over Antwerp as this place was recommended to us by some local people and on the day we visited it was free. We had to put our belongings in lockers before we could go up the series of escalators but the views were",
          "This museum is difficult to understand. It has 10 floors with wonderful views to whole city. But first couple of floors you really doesn't know what to think. It seems like chaos. Open your mind and after while the atmosphere will get you :)",
          "When we arrived, we decided just to look around and not actually go into any exhibits, which cost money. We definitely did not regret our decision. The design was amazing and it's a good place for children. I highly recommend it to anyone who is anyone.",
          "We walked to the MAS from the cathedral, about 20 minutes, and decided to climb to the top as it is free and the view over Antwerp is amazing. We did not look at the museum but I am sure it would be worth the entrance fee. The museum has escalators going right to the top so you",
          "The tall building is beautifully designed and the view from the top on Antwerp is very nice. The materials seem to be sensitive to the times, who knows. The exhibitions are childish and mostly meaningless with explanations on cards next to it, very annoying.",
          "Just go for the view from the roof. The kids will love the escalators to the top. Last Wednesdays of the month the entrance is free.",
          "The museum is great and features all major artists; however after a whole week of modern art, added by Rembrandt, Von Gogh and Rubens, our best artistic moment of the day was sunset over the city of Antwerp and the beautiful shades provided by sunset under a clear sky with",
          "The temporary exhibition \"Dazling Desire\" is about diamonds and their emotional desire. A splendid exhibition showing lots of jewelry with diamonds. Facinating! very well exposed. You need to takes the visitors guide (4 languages) to follow and understand the exhibition. Pitty",
          "So sorry for waiting and expecting to see at least something interesting.. The only interesting thing,maybe,was the view of the town from the roof and the architect design of the building!even we visited all the exibitions in the other floors, hoping to change or improve our not",
          "Nice museum on various subject. The focus however is on history of Antwerp and the harbor in specific. As such very interesting when you want to know about how Antwerp came to be. The other subjects are centered around the colonial history of Western Europe. That being said,",
          "The building and architecture is amazing. Worth the 20 min walk from city centre. The exhibitions (10 euro) I didn't like too much but you can also go visit the building including rooftop view without buying a ticket.",
          "We only went the 10 floors to see the amazing views of Antwerp and the harbor (second largest in Europe), but the museum looked amazing and wished we had the day to take this in. Don't miss the small visitor center about the harbor. It's amazing! A highlight of Antwerp, for sure!",

          "We had heard great things about Antwerp and it's architecture and the 'MAS' was supposed to be the highlight of our day trip. Sure, architecturally its quirky and different but the museum itself was a big disappointment. We got caught out on entrance by being told in no",
          "nice exhibition centre. nice free rooftop views. just incredible for sunset. a bit tiring and boring to go all around the escalators to get up and down.",
          "First, the obvious. This is a striking piece of architecture, particularly given that it is has no other tall buildings around it. And this innovation is carried on inside. It is in effect a collection of small museums with each floor focusing on a different exhibition. And many",
          "It's really must see if you want to get a nice pictures of Antwerp. Entrance is free for panorama and basic facts about city itself. You can also pay for a ticket to museum's exhibitions. On the roof you will get a chance to snap great pics of Antwerp's port and downtown area.",
          "When I visited there were no special exhibitions so I visited the standard exhibition which were O'K but not memorable. Having said that it was only 3 euros for me to get in so for the price it was fine. You can skip the exhibits and take the escalators to the top of the",
          "We took the escalators to the top for free, just for the view. Took just 15 minutes. It was beautiful. Worth going even if you don't like art for the view.",

          "MAS is a very modern museum and manages to combine various topics with the city of Antwerp, which gives the exhibitions an interesting and local spin. It's modern nature means that it impresses with high-tech features: movies, sounds, and several ways for visitors to engage with",
          "The view is the best part of this museum. Exhibits had no cohesion and really were nothing as described online while researching the place. If I were to plan my day in Antwerp over again is skip this place.",
          "I love this museum! There are both permanent and temporary excibitions, so there is always something new to see in MAS! History of the town and port, trade and ships! There are pieces of art and history even on the escalators. And the view is amazing, stretching all over",
          "Firstly, we did not have to pay to enter the building, not sure why. It is well worth the experience, the views from every floor are breathtaking and the building has been beautifully constructed and decorated. There are escalators on every floor so people who are unable to",

          "MAS is absolutely a museum to visit when in Antwerp. It is a modern building and inside you have a sense of space. The collection is well presented and you'll never get crunched in crowds... Sometimes (frequently) there are special exhibitions. A must see, for everyone",
          "We went into museum and it was modern fun so inspiring and so much culture and art everywhere it was great",
          "We visited this museum with a group of friends. It was a very varied group. The guide understood very wel that she had to adapt her text to several different kind of visitors.",
          "The view from the roof is exceptional. It's free too. It's a long ride up by escalator and it's a fair walk from the town centre but it's a great view back into the town.",
          "Nice museum with permanent and changing exhibitions. You can have a view into the museum's stock. Some exhibitions are always for free. The view from the roof terrace is spectacular. Restaurant is clos d on weekends (sic) but there are a lot opts for drink and food around.",
          "Best thing of this all is the panorama on top of the MAS is absolutely free, that's what we've done to enjoy the view. It's one of the highest points in whole Antwerp and you can really see the whole city, from the \"schelde\" to the cathedral of Antwerp. Must go if you'd ask me!",

          "My two daughters and I visited the museum today - the tickets cost me 10 euros, the girls (11 and 3) were free. The exhibits were on each floor starting with the 3rd. To tell the truth, I wasn't greatly impressed with them, some were simply shocking to see...I guess my favorite",

          "Skipped museum and walked to the terrace (by escalator)! which was free for public to enjoy the whole 360\u00ba view of the city.....just amazing....its must visit place. Surrounding was also very nice to spend some good time.",

          "It is a place you must visit when you stay in Antwerp. A lot of culture and because it is so large always a quiet place to stay. You can walk on your own or guided. Don't forget the panoramic terrace, it is worth to go upstairs.",
          "We only visited here for about an hour. we climbed to the top to see a beautiful view of Antwerp and the river. Would have like to see the whole place but our time was limited. Plan on spending a good part of a day there if you do go. The chocolate exhibit was small and a",
          "We did not enter the museum, we only went to see the view from the top of the building and was well worth the trip plus it was free I would recommend it if you have the time to view the city",
          "Spectacular building, great panoramic view of Antwerp from the rooftop. Access to the building (including rooftop) and part of the museum is free, but there is an entrance fee for the major part of the exhibition. I'm not entirely convinced by the exhibition concept. It's that",
          "Everything about this building is pleasing; it's position, design and layout are outstanding. Every floor has appeal, from the study area to the free access exhibits. The panoramic view of Antwerp is wonderful; don't forget to look down at the skull mosaic from Luc Tuymans.",
          "It all starts with the sight of the very special even futuristic design of the building. An eye catcher are certainly the large corrugated glass windows. In the museum you can, for free, the 7 (I think) escalators to go the the panorama deck and have a magnificent 360\u00b0 view over",
          "I went just for the panoramic view at the top and it was very worth it. You can clearly see the mix of old and new and have a notion of how large the port is.",
          "When I firstly arrived to Antwerp, MAS were the first choice. Museum on every floor, great terrace to see the surroundings, restaurant and a cafe to rest and eat. This was the best way for me to start a new chapter! Bravo, MAS!",
          "This is a bot out of the way, but it is worth it. Free panoramic view form the rooftop, and some exhibitions also free. Also great surrounding area to visit.",

          "Normally you go to a museum to watch what is inside, right? Try this museum when you are in Antwerp. This museum can amaze you with what is inside, but also the building itself and the location of the building has such a lot of beauty. Don't miss it when you visit Antwerp.....",
          "A stunning new building with panoramic views of Antwerp (but inly if you are able to climb the stairs to the roof) and fantastic exhibition spaces. You have to pay to visit the exhibitions but there is free and fascinating access to one of the museum's storage spaces where they",
          "The design of the building is interesting and the story behind it as well - there are hands planted on the outside of the building, and this is related to a legend of Antwerp, which I won't spoil for you now. I went to the top of the building (going to the top was free) and",
          "The profile this building commands on the old dockside is striking, and the construction of the building will live with me for a long time. It's a massive place, and lead us to a brand new part of the city, which otherwise we may not have visited. There was a lot to see, and",
          "View from the town from the top, however to be honest there isn't anything that impressive to see. The inside museum could be interesting however most details are not available in English so could catch the all meaning of all. There is one part which refer to the old time port",
          "Walking along the river, the orange MAS stands like an icon among the cafes, boats and port of Antwerp. It's worth visiting for the 360 degree panoramic view of Antwerp. The architecture is innovative, green and enhances the port. Inside are exhibitions which focus on the",
          "Well worth a visit as a historical review of this ancient seaport. The staff were excellent for there assistance and literature.",
          "There are not too many tourist visiting the museum. It is about 15 mins from the grote markt and believe me you will enjoy it. The maritime history is very rich.",
          "Unfortunately I didn't manage to see the exhibitions, just walked up to the viewing platform, which gives great views of the city. Views from each floor are also very nice.",
          "No ticket needed to enjoy a great view of Antwerp! You can easily take the escalator to the 9th floor with only one flight of stairs to the 10th floor observation deck. We honestly didn't go in to the museum areas because we were limited on time, but it was worth just enjoying",
          "The building is beautiful, or kind of, anyway. The \"hand\" -the trademark of Antwerp is dotted around ond the surface of this building. You can get to the top for free which is a great view. Beside the building is a nice area too.",
          "What a shame that such a great building gets such poor curating. Although the names of the different exhibits were very tempting & promising none of them managed to please the eye or satisfy the curiosity. Many of the rooms were overloaded with objects but not enough light to",
          "I went to this museum for the view from the rooftop, but was glad I took time to see the museum. Each floor has a theme based display of art, culture or history. The most interesting portion if the open storage which you can see. Most museums keep their storage vaults closed,",
          "For sure one of the most amazing views in antwerp , made a visit in december they had the like an exhibition about the old islamic civilization , and they had the old key of the KAABA where muslims go to hajj , again i repeat its a go to photographers on sun set .",

          "MAS is a fabulous building and suprisely good to do with kids; several search tours and they liked it a lot! The guards happy to help with searching things from the tours. We went to the caf\u00e9 on first floor, nice space and good (but expensive as always at musea) Food. Nit that",
          "You are able to go to the rooftop for free and it really is worth it. The view of the city is really beautiful. The building itself is also lovely and worth the trip just to look at it.",
          "Each floor brings it's cultural interest and the top floor / roof top offers you the panoramic view of Antwerp. Really easily accessible, the stairs and escalators are really convenient to go up the floors. Brasserie is handy. Worth visiting!",
          "Completely worth a visit. Nice view, and friendly staff there helps, and explained what exhibition there was.",
          "Did not visit the museum. But the views from the top are free and well worth a visit especially on a clear day.",

          "Entry to the building is free of charge, so no excuse not to go. You can go to the top of the building and have a look at Antwerp. The museum and temporary expositions are not free, you'll need to buy a ticket. Close by you have a small harbor and lot's of restaurants so please",
          "There is no charge if you only want to see the fantastic view. You have to ride many escalators, yes many before you are up. You get 360 surrounded view.",
          "A view from the top will leave you speechless, it's not too high offering amazing viewers of a beautiful Antwerpen. The museum collection I personally have found less interesting, but might be a good option on a rainy day.",
          "I'm not a museum type of person but my hotel suggested visit for a nice view from the rooftop terrace. Make sure you dont buy a tciket as its free to visit the terrace but thats not imediatley obviousl when you enter the building!",
          "Great view of Antwerp, city, river, ports...from this impressive building. Open to visitors for long hours. Different perspectives from each floor, and complete panorama from the top. Highly recommended.",
          "Just worth going to the viewing platform if nothing else. The artistic value of the build in itself is amazing with the curved glass walls. Great view over the city. Free to go up.",
          "My first visit of the MAS. Great and gorgeous building, but very bizarre, un-coherent exhibitions. As well, for the English native speaker: practically no translations. Very odd. The views are spectacular.",
          "You can see the view of the city from day and night. It is a must see of the city. There is no doubt for me to say that you have to go there when you pass by Antwerp, not for the exhibitions but more to see the roof top !",
          "Very interesting museum about the relationship between Antwerp and the world (city, river, port...). Impressive architecture. If on a tight schedule, at least climb to the terrace (free entrance) for breathtaking views over the city !",

          "We didn't visit any of the museum attractions but went up to the viewing gallery via the escalators, I really liked the pictures that are the backdrops to the escalators which are of local businesses both old and new-some of the pictures are quirky to say the least. Up on the",

          "The Museum aan de Stroom is a museum located along the river Scheldt in the Eilandje district of Antwerp, Belgium. The fa\u00e7ade is made of Indian red sandstone and curved glass panel construction. Included in the Antwerp half day city tour, this landmark is not to be missed,",

          "Great architecture, great views, and great exhibitions that rotate. Certainly worth a visit if you're in Antwerp.",
          "Not to be missed sight in Antwerp. High modernist landmark building rising from the old dock area. Watch the created outdoor skull motif emerge on the ground below as you ascend the escalator - referencing the Quentin Massys memorial on the front of the cathedral. Fabulous view",
          "First a caveat: I'm not usually keen on very modern art or architecture so was sceptical about this place. but it repays an exploration, both as an interestingly designed space, as an exhibition centre with very varied contents (Antwerp's boats and harbour, local folk culture,",
          "One of the iconic views in Antwerp, this impressive architecture is also worth seeing from the inside. On every floor, you can stop and watch the view from the curved windows, until you reach the roof, where you have a panoramic view over the whole city and the port of Antwerp.",
          "The MAS ( museum at the stream(river Schelde)) is a wonder of architecture. The content is not worth visiting for me, but it gives a free and astonishing view over the city, the river and the petrochemical industry. With escalators from floor to floor it is easy to reach the",
          "Great and playful way for kids (and parents) to combine art/culture with a fun afternoon Antwerp. Appealing expositions on several floors of the MAS, making it a diverse museum to visit.",
          "The MAS is well worth a visit, and towers above the Antwerp skyline. Sometimes they hold special exhibitions the details of which can be found at the National Tourist Office. It's a structurally impressive building and when you finish the tour there is a very nice restaurant",
          "Strange looking building, many like it but seems a bit busy to me! However it is well kept, clean and functions well Check to see what is on and if it interests you, if it does go there. The local area have been rebuilt and modernised with plenty of cafes and restaurants (some",
          "Beautiful building with probably the best free view over the city. The permanent exhibitions are a good introduction to the history and culture of the city and Belgium. They also have temporary interesting exhibitions. The museum is huge, so if you wanna see the whole thing,",

          "The MAS museum is very well laid out and easy to navigate. The staff are helpful and friendly. The exhibitions we viewed we multi cultural and accommodated the kinaesthetic learner\ud83d\udc4d. The view of Antwerp from the roof top is well worth the trip",
          "Arrived late so only managed to make it up to the panoramic terrace from where there are commanding views over the entire city and port - although bizarrely enjoyed more the slightly distorted views through the wavy glass! 25min leisurely walk from Central Station well worth the",

          "Wow, never ending. We were here whilst there was an exhibition of Buddhist art, which was lucky. Really worth a visit. There are sections that may not interest you but can be bypassed. The way the different collections are displayed is also cool. One thing that was super",
          "A beautiful museum to walk around. The building itself is spectacular and the exhibitions are very interesting. They did a great job in making this museum attractive. Definitely a must go while you're in Antwerp!",
          "Wonderful building situated on the quayside. I recommend exploring the building which you can do for free. The museum ,which you pay for, is lacking purpose and soul. It is as if they bought the building then thought 'what shall we do with it?' It housed the cities ethnographic",

          "We were really shocked by the photos on the walls (dead pig and cow heads - very bizarre- maybe they will add pictures of rotting corpses for our entertainment?) The curator of this museum needs to move out of the middle ages and into the 21st century. We were bored overall. The",
          "This is an amazing space, and its free to go into the building. The exhibitions were very good, with helpful guides to take you round. The views as you go up are stunning- and the rolling glass walls truly beautiful.",

          "We moved here recently and went there the other day with our guests. Great exhibitions, great architecture and great way to see beautiful Antwerpen from the rooftop terrace on 10th floor. At the ground level there is a nice bar/brasserie with tasty coconut milk soup.",
          "The building alone is worth a visit. Very different exhibitions, all well made, nice museum shop as well. The panorama terrace is great, don't miss it! What I don't get is how they could build the toilet cabins for only super slim people (I am, and I could hardly turn around",

          "Excellent collections and great interactive exhibits... The central and South American collections on the 8th floor are the best I've seen. The mobile connectivity and free wifi made it a great experience. I would thoroughly recommend this museum to everyone visiting Antwerp.",
          "We visited on Monday and the museum is closed. It was worth the walk to see the distinct architecture. Learn the story of the hands that decorate the exterior and the mythological spirit of the city.",
          "Very awesome building with a very awesome panoramic views of the city. You must go to the top of the building and enjoy the views, it's free!",
          "The highlight for most tourist however, would be the view of the whole Antwerp from the roof of the MAS. The exhibits were good and quite different. The cafe serves nice lemon cake and tea.",
          "I didn't go in the museum. I went directly to the rooftop in order to enjoy the view over the city and over the huge habor. Definitely worth it.",
          "Best museum ever visited, especially the building and the view on top of it are great. I recommend to visit Mas if you happen to be in Antwerp.",
          "We were very impressed by this museum. Alone architecture and design of this building is worth visiting. Also, you get a fantastic 360\u00b0 panorama view from the roof. It houses excellent exhibitions. Worth going there in any case!",
          "Very nice building, area and view from the top of the Museum Aan de Stroom. The expos were nicely organised and very interesting and beautiful.",
          "Some very funky exhibits, but you can take the escalators to the top for a great view of the harbor for free.",
          "The architecture itself of the museum is very interesting and particularly beautiful on a sunny day. It's very family friendly and there's a lot to see. A trip to the rooftop will afford a great view of Antwerp!",
          "Not so impressed by the exhibitions, just because it's not my aim to see. instead the building itself is originally designed, especially windows and has a great view on the city. It's even free of charge if you don't attend exhibitions.",
          "It was great to visit this museum .The building itself was different from any museum .The glass wall gives you a great view in every floor.It was great experience to my kids.",
          "Really surprising and must do. Straight to level 10! The top roof visit is free of charge and ideal for a panorama view",
          "The museum features various interesting sections, including unusual ones. What I liked the most was the possibility to use my smartphone for looking up the exhibit descriptions in English via scanning the QR code. It saves the hassle of carrying around a ton of paper brochures",
          "While we didn't have time to go through the museum the trip to the top was well worth the hike! It is free which is even better. Not sure if there are elevators though. We took the escalators and the final flight was stairs. Check before you go if you need an elevator.",
          "Amazing place to unwind and relax .. lots many amazing eat outs and joints to enjoy food, especially in evenings ..must visit for all",
          "Interesring museum in a very modern building. You can walk around in the buiding an go to the top terrace without buying i tickets. For seeying the collections you need a ticket",
          "One of my favourite spots in Antwerp, I loved to go to the roof top (you can access it for free) and enjoy the view.",
          "Absolutely fantastic museum. Great for all ages. Always exiting exhibitions and plenty to see. Reasonable prices. Must see when you come to Antwerp.",
          "I wanted to see this building as it was in a book that I had. While we did not go to the museum inside it is worth bvisiting purely because of the way it is constructed and the materials used.",
          "A great place for architecture and art lovers alike. Lovely example of sucessful interpolation into an old city, Great set of museums. interesting architecture inside out and great shows. Top terrace view is a must!",
          "This museum is housed in a remarkable building. It has been a driving force in the development of the surrounding area. It houses several temporary and a permanent exhibition. Absolute highlight is the roof terrace with views over the old city, the river Scheldt and the harbour.",
          "A friend recommended to check out this museum as you can have a 360 view of the city for free. Nothing else was open though.",
          "Excellent location and futuristic building . So nice neighborhood around it, also inside its nice to visit.",

          "Situated in marine always crowded but very interesting. Worth to go to the top and see the landscape. I would recommend to take a guide to enjoy the details.",
          "Sadly the museum was closed when we got there but the building is accessible until late at night for the panoramic view. Escalators take you up and the decoration of the building tells you a little story about Antwerp. A big sightseeing tip!",
          "apart from the much mentioned view on the (free accessible) roof top, the MAS is more visual display than content. However, The pre-Columbian collection of art of Paul and Dora Janssen alone more or less justifies the entrance fee. I'd recommend a visit by starting at the roof",
          "The people of Antwerp are usually very proud of this recent museum. I am not. I guess you should visit it and see for yourself. Some people like it a lot. Some people don't. Personally, I really don't. I'll tell you why. I think the architecture is downright ugly. I have",
          "Trip advisor asks: Is this free to the public? - Yes: The walk in the wave ascending walls to the roof with a view into the port and city is free and recommendable. - No: The MAS (museum in the stream) collects several collections in its floors that are not free for entrance."

        "wiki": "Antwerp ( (listen); Dutch: Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen); French: Anvers [\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281s] (listen)) is a city in Belgium and the capital of Antwerp province in the Flemish Region. With a population of 520,504, it is the most populous city proper in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people, it is the second largest metropolitan region after Brussels.Antwerp is on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe and within the top 20 globally. The city is also known for its diamond industry and trade.\nBoth economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt. Antwerp was also the place of the world's oldest stock exchange building, originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872.The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren (Dutch pronunciation: [s\u026a\u0272\u02c8jo\u02d0r\u0259(n)]), after the Spanish honorific se\u00f1or or French seigneur, \"lord\", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century. The city hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is New Latin.A Germanic (Frankish or Frisian) origin could contain prefix anda (\u201cagainst\u201d) and a noun derived from the verb werpen (\u201cto throw\u201d) and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit; a mound (like a terp) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf. If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean \"those who live on both banks\".There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river. He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt.\n\n\n=== Pre-1500 ===\nHistorical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952\u20131961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. The earliest mention of Antwerp dates from the 4th century.\nIn the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks.The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II, a border province facing the County of Flanders.\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon,  was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nAfter the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant, grew in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly enslaved Africans as the century progressed. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544\u20131574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became \"the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height.\" Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the \"Age of Exploration\". During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps.  Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas\".\n\nWithout a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venetian Republic, Republic of Ragusa, Spain and Portugal.  Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \"To the merchants of all nations.\" Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers.  In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth.  Numerous financial bankruptcies  began around 1557. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nThe religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries. The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury: 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over \u00a32 million sterling of damage was done.\n\n\n=== Dutch revolt ===\nSubsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa, and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock) and an access- lock and mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.\n\nIn 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chass\u00e9. For a time Chass\u00e9 subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass\u00e9 made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi)  from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAntwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During World War I, the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Li\u00e8ge. The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.\nAntwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. \nDuring World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote, V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic) Orthodox Judaism.\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into nine entities (districts):\n\nAntwerp\nBerchem\nBerendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo\nBorgerhout\nDeurne\nEkeren\nHoboken\nMerksem\nWilrijkIn 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp, the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.\n\n\n== Buildings and landmarks ==\n\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was noted for the wealth of its citizens (\"Antwerpia nummis\"). The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the Hanseatic League on the northern quays, in 1891. During World War II, the city also suffered considerable damage from V-bombs, and in recent years, other noteworthy buildings have been demolished for new developments.\n\nAntwerp Zoo opened in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the world.\nAntwerp City Hall dates from 1565, and is built primarily in Renaissance style.\nAntwerp Central Station is a railway station designed by Louis Delacenserie which was completed in 1905.\nCathedral of Our Lady. This church was begun in the 14th century and finished in 1518. The church has four works by Rubens, viz. \"The Descent from the Cross\", \"The Elevation of the Cross\", \"The Resurrection of Christ\" and \"The Assumption\"\nSt. James' Church, is more ornate than the cathedral. It contains the remains of numerous famous nobles, among them a major part of the family of Rubens.\nThe Church of St. Paul has a baroque interior. It is a few hundred yards north of the Grote Markt\nSt. Andrew's Church\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church\nMuseum Vleeshuis (Butchers' Hall) is a fine Gothic brick-built building, situated a short distance to the North-West of the Grote Markt.\nPlantin-Moretus Museum preserves the house of the printer Christoffel Plantijn and his successor Jan Moretus\nThe Saint-Boniface Church is an Anglican church and headseat of the archdeanery North-West Europe.\nBoerentoren (Farmers' Tower) or KBC Tower, a 26-storey building built in 1932, is the oldest skyscraper in Europe. It is the tallest building in Antwerp and the second tallest structure after the Cathedral of our Lady. The building was designed by Emiel van Averbeke, R. Van Hoenacker and Jos Smolderen.\nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts\nMuseum Mayer van den Bergh, with works from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nRubenshuis is the former home and studio of Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) in Antwerp. It is now a museum.\nRockox House is the former 17th-century Residence of Nicolaas II Rockox, lord Mayor of Antwerp.\nBourse of Antwerp. Originally built 1531; extensively restored 1872; now Antwerp Trade Fair.\nPalace of Justice, designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006. This building is the antithesis of the heavy, dark court building, designed by Joseph Poelaert, which dominates the skyline of Brussels. The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built on the site of the old Zuid (\"South\") station, at the end of a magnificent 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12). The building's highest 'sail' is 51 m (167 ft) high, has a floor area of 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft), and cost \u20ac130 million.\nZurenborg, a late-19th-century Belle \u00c9poque neighbourhood, on the border of Antwerp and Berchem, with many Art Nouveau architectural elements. The area counts as one of the most original Belle \u00c9poque urban expansion areas in Europe.\nMuseum aan de Stroom\nDen Botaniek or Antwerp's Botanical Garden, created in 1825. Located in the city centre, at the Leopoldstraat, it covers an area of almost 1 hectare.\nHarmonium Art museuM, a museum on pump organs in Klein-Willebroek\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (M HKA)\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\n\nAlthough Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former enceinte, only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. A replica of a castle named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais in the 19th century.\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:\n\n10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch\n12th and 13th century: canals (so called \"vlieten\" and \"ruien\") were made\n16th century: Spanish fortifications\n19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications\n20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\nThis is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.\n\n\n=== Minorities ===\nIn 2010, 36% to 39% of the inhabitants of Antwerp had a migrant background. A study projects that in 2020, 55% of the population will be of migrant background.\n\n\n==== Jewish community ====\n\nAfter The Holocaust and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic, live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff  (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk, based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Ger, Skver, Klausenburg, Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\n==== Jain community ====\n\nThe Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business. Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds. A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk).  Mr Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a full-fledged member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nThere are significant Armenian communities that reside in Antwerp, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with a smaller numbers are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church.\nOne of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel and involved in is the diamond trade business, that based primarily in the diamond district. Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nAccording to the American Association of Port Authorities, the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014\u20132020.  The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.\n\n\n=== Diamonds ===\nAntwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion. The city has four diamond bourses: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers. Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian and Maronite Christian from Lebanon and Armenian, traders become increasingly important.Antwerp World Diamond Centre, (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry. However, in recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nA six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to Brussels, Hasselt and Li\u00e8ge, Ghent, Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"Oosterweelconnection\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to Amsterdam and Paris, and national trains to Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Brussels, Charleroi, Hasselt, Li\u00e8ge, Leuven and Turnhout.\nAntwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald's haunting novel Austerlitz. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"premetro\" and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nA small airport, Antwerp International Airport, is located in the district of Deurne, with passenger service to various European destinations. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre.\nThe now defunct VLM Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport. This office is also CityJet's Antwerp office. When VG Airlines (Delsey Airlines) existed, its head office was located in the district of Merksem.Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport, is about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.\nThere is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs twice every hour on working days.\nThe runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.\nIn September 2019 Air Antwerp began operations with their first route to London City Airport with old VLM Airlines Fokker 50's.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections.\nThe current majority consists of N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld, led by mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA).\n\n\n=== Former mayors ===\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century important mayors include Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Nicolaas II Rockox.\nIn the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti\u00e8ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (New Flemish Alliance).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntwerp has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) similar to that of Southern England, while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) average highs for both July and August. Winters are more dominated by the maritime currents instead, with temps being heavily moderated.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAntwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its school of painting, which included Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the Teniers and many others.\n\nInformally, most Antverpians (in Dutch Antwerpenaren, people from Antwerp) speak Antverpian daily (in Dutch Antwerps), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other Brabantic dialects for its characteristic pronunciation of vowels: an 'aw' sound approximately like that in 'bore' is used for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the 'a' in 'hat'. The Echt Antwaarps Teater (\"Authentic Antverpian Theatre\") brings the dialect on stage.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nAntwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in the world.

In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally \"Antwerp Hands\". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.\n\n\n=== Missions to seafarers ===\nA number of Christian missions to seafarers are based in Antwerp, notably on the Itali\u00eblei. These include the Mission to Seafarers, British & International Sailors' Society, the Finnish Seamen's Mission, the Norwegian Sj\u00f8mannskirken and the Apostleship of the Sea. They provide cafeterias, cultural and social activities as well as religious services.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAntwerp is the home of the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC), founded in 1938 and located on the square Grote Markt since 1994.The band dEUS was formed in 1991 in Antwerp. dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material.

Since 1998, the club has taken Manchester United players on loan in an official partnership. Another club in the city was Beerschot VAC, founded in 1899 by former Royal Antwerp players. They played at the Olympisch Stadion, the main venue of the 1920 Olympics. Nowadays KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk plays at the Olympisch Stadion in the Belgian Second Division.\nThe Antwerp Giants play in Basketball League Belgium and Topvolley Antwerpen play in the Belgium men's volleyball League.\nFor the year 2013, Antwerp was awarded the title of European Capital of Sport.\nAntwerp hosted the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nAntwerp hosted the start of stage 3 of the 2015 Tour de France on 6 July 2015.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\nAntwerp has a university and several colleges.

          "It was amazing time for me and my family",
          "Was very saddening to see all the beautiful animals depressed in the captivity. And why on earth they have exotic animals in Belgium? Nothing natural about having animals in cages and have loud noises/kids all day around. You can learn more about these animals from documentaries, rather than in these jails, called zoos \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e",
          "Love the park, very neath. Well care of the animals. Ensure which are there. No big cats, neither big birds at our visit. Nice experience. Good to join to a visit to town or other exhibit.",

          "It's a nice place to vist but it doesn't deserve  28 euro to pay , and most of the sections are closed",
          "A great place to visit, for both kids and adults. You can spend a hole day with your family here and have a great time. For us the butterflies, the aquarium and the night animals were the most fascinating attractions.",

          "Lovely place. Clean. Tranquil. Well nourished animals. Very good coffee. Nocturama part is really dark, just for those who have bad sight. A part of the section of birds was under reconstruction. Didn't see any lions although indicated to be present. The butterfly house and aquarium section are my personal favorites.",
          "High quality zoo in the middle of the city centre! Don\u2019t forget the butterfly room.",
          "Beautiful zoo. Very surprising lay out. Shame they have had so much of it closed at peak months over the last 2 years.",

          "Much better than expected! Not the same as paira daiza but still worth taken a day to visit. The little one and we were very entertained",
          "Nice zoo, not so big so you can manage to see everything in one day. We were impressed by the gorillas and  big monkeys. Some animals would benefit from bigger enclosures though...",
          "Beautiful place well kept! Beware during the week it's full of school kids and the fish and reptile areas can get extremely loud. Tickets are around 19 Euro per adult. So it's not cheap but I guess that keeps that place really in pristine condition! Highlight was the feeding of the birds of prey and the artic penguins",
          "A very beautiful and well kept zoo, with lots of different animals. The price is a bit steep, but it makes sense in order to maintain the structure. The aquarium is gorgeous!",
          "Very good especially the aquarium.",

          "Easy to find. Just beside the central station. The price is a bit high. There is no family price. I loved the Flamigos at least I was able to peep and see them. The gift shop at the entrance is filled with very nice gift souvenirs.",
          "Very nice and tourist friendly place",
          "Remarkable place. The beautiful buildings in the park bear witness to the original concept of the \"zoological gardens\". Today the people working there are friendly and helpful, making the zoo a very attractive place.",

          "Spent a good quality time with my son",

          "Small cages for the animals. Last time I was there it was a bear walking back and forth on the same spot... This is clear signs of the animal being distressed/unhappy... Hope you can make it better for them.. until then, I will not visit this park/zoo.",
          "It is clean and plenty of animals that you can see",
          "Fun and interesting place, lots of animals all in proper \"themed areas\", easily accessible due to the train station next to it. If you're looking for a fun zoo with lots of interesting creatures you should check this one out.",

          "Nice zoo in the centre of Antwerp. Good atmosphere.",
          "One of the best city Zoo's I have visited. Next to the Antwerp Central Station it is a green oasis in the city. Children will especially love it. I recommend to include in your Antwerp visit. Come by tram or train, to drive and park is stressfull.",
          "Not the biggest zoo or with more animals but definitely one with nicest architectures and fun I have visited. Especially something different if you are not from Europe. Worths the price especially if you bring a good camera with you.",

          "Such a lovely little zoo, great fun!",
          "Very nice zoo, but rather expensive if you visit only once per year. If you visit more than once it's best to get a yearly family ticket, which covers this zoo and another one in Planckendael. The parking nearby was horrible, we even encountered a drug addict shooting his dose on the chairs (thank God the kids didn't see him)!",

          "Nice place with exceptional usage of space, very small but has many kinds of species. It's near the central station and easier to reach. Since it's small we can finish in 4-5 hours. Has lot of resting spots and few shows will make your day eventful.",

          "nice, unexpected species, but a bit pricy. restaurants are terrible.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Great facilities, large enclosures with activities for the animals. May be a little long for little legs, so for families with toddlers I recommend you take a pushchair /buggy.

          "The zoo is very big. It\u2019s appointed with numbers at each animal category. Nevertheless it was a bit confusing because there were so many hided ways to go. Felt like I missed the look at a few animals. A sad thing about the visit was that a lot of animals weren\u2019t in their",
          "Can't believe how such a big and beautiful zoo can be in the center of a city. Spent a day here and it was amazing, particularly the elephants and the red panda! Loved the number system to help you round to ensure you see everything and I really liked the skywalk so give views",
          "As an employee at a zoo, I have had many different experiences traveling around the world seeing different zoos and learning about how they operate. Without a doubt, the Antwerp Zoo is one of the most beautiful and well-done zoos I have been to. The mix of historic enclosures",
          "This zoo is right next to the railway station so is easily accessible. Lots of animals to see. I think the only downside is the price as it was \u20ac28 per adult and as there were 4 of us it was fairly expensive. We still had a good time and the butterfly house was amazing",
          "I have been to many zos around the world; this is one of the best I have ever visited. The animals are well cared for, seemingly have enough room, and live in an attractive venue -- at least for the human visitors. I especially enjoyed the butterfly garden and the amazingly",
          "Right next to the central station is a good compact zoo with a lot of different animals from butterfly to elefants and lots in between. Worth a visit",
          "Fantastic place. Clean and superbly maintained. Plenty \u201cstrange\u201d animals never seen before. Worthwhile place to visit when in Belgium.",
          "I've got a bit disappointed about how expensive is the zoo. Lots of publicity for not be so amazing how I expected",
          "Took the train in from Brussels. Let me start by saying that was the most beautiful station I\u2019ve seen so far. The zoo was spectacular. Very clean and animals seemed well care for. Variety of animals from giraffes, kangaroos, unique monkeys, birds, hippos and many more. A",
          "My friend was ill on the one day we had a whole day to explore in Antwerp and I still feel guilty about going to the zoo without her because it\u2019s incredible! The animals have lots of space and are treated with respect, it\u2019s so educational and is just. A great day out!",
          "Even if I do not recommend to exhibit animal outside their environment I have to admit that this place looks amazing for children who want to see a lot of animals in one day. There is also a few places to eat and drink and a playground for children. Funny to say but butterflies",
          "Awesome layout and maintenance. Worth watching the zoo. At entrance itself flamingoes greet their presence. Very nice.",
          "I grew up in Antwerp, so I know this Zoo quite well and it's always great to visit it thru all those years. Lots of animals ofcource but what a great garden and surroundings. They are still adding new spectacular places to watch the animals in a better way. Location couldn't be",
          "The zoo is well located near the railway station. Well equipped zoo, small but beautiful. Great for an afternoon of fun.",
          "Had a great time at this wonderful zoo. Enjoyed the sea lion show even though it was a language I didn't understand. Had the best time and the Monkeys and they have a beautiful aquarium section as well. Just make sure to have good shoes as it is quite a lot of walking.",
          "I love this place so much, and my 2 yrs son enjoying watching all the animals and his favourite one is zebba(zebra)\ud83d\ude00 I visit every week this zoo as i have yearly subscription",
          "This zoo has got lots to see. There were some empty enclosures, but the zoo itself is open about that and had explanations for why. All of the explanations around the zoo were in English, Dutch and French and was very interesting. Some of the enclosure do have some horrific",
          "The zoo of Antwerp is a real hidden gem. Although a little expensive, they do go the extra mile to innovate and present you with a wonderful experience. It\u2019s a beautiful park to walk in, let your children play and admire the animals. Due to its space, they have to be very",
          "Great location right next to Central Station. Cost is a little high at 28 Euros for an adult but this is a big zoo with lots to see. The butterfly area is amazing with big blue butterflies and other smaller ones flying around your head. The fish area is also good with a huge",
          "The toddlers had a blast. But then again, they don't reflect on paying to see animals in cages. Clean but small cages. North American Porcupine showed stress behaviour. Ape cages minimal and sad.",
          "This is a certainly a visit to do, besides the wide range of animals you can watch, there are the very beautifull gardens, which are very well maintained.",
          "We went here to see the Koala as neither of us had ever seen one 'live'! This was an experience going to a non-british zoo but was good fun. It is very unusual to have a zoo right next to a Railway station but this is. The Zoo is good and the animals varied I would recommend a",
          "We we're looking forward to combine our city trip with a visit to the zoo, so we did. Entry fee of 28\u20ac for adults and 25.5\u20ac for teenagers/students. The zoo did good effort to have nice looking animal cages and clean park. Despite the warning that animals can hide themselves from",
          "Love every bit about the zoo where nature and CSR Are big on its agenda. The penguin enclosure is an interesting sight, as well as the flamingos.",
          "No one can ever agree that a zoo is as good as the wilderness that any animal is truly home to, but I was pleasantly surprised by the space and details created by Antwerp Zoo. Still a classic city centre zoo but with many enclosures which really allow you to get up close with",
          "A surprisingly great urban zoo with plenty of spacious attractions and pleasant paths. They even have a large indoor aquarium. This was my second visit, first with my son, and it was even better than the first time.",
          "Last time I visited the zoo was with my son some 35 years ago, the then little boy loved it, and so did I. This time it was a total disappointment hardly any animals many of the displays were under construction. It would be fair from the management to notify people of the",
          "Every year I am invited to visit Antwerp zoo on my birthday. Every year I discover new places and animals I've never seen before. One can easily spend an entire day at the zoo. Don't rush yourself but enjoy the animals.",
          "Getting off the train and walking into a zoo within five minutes is amazing The layout of the zoo is well thought out and each exhibit area has multiple viewing areas so that you can get up close and personal with the animals. We s half a day here and really enjoyed it with",
          "In the hart of the city you can find this beautiful city zoo. The animals have a decent amount of space and the zoo itself is constantly changing to keep up with the latest innovations.",
          "What a pleasant surprise - a delightful oasis right next to the station (like 20 metres). Beautifully laid out with a fantastic selection of animals all in nice enclosures.",
          "We enjoyed the zoo, there were so many diverse animals, including a baby Gorilla. It took us 3 hours to see it all and worth the time to see it all. It was unusual to see the animals in a green environment while being across from the central station of Antwerp and the middle of",
          "All the birds animals, reptiles, penguins etc were all housed as close to natural habitat as possible. Most of the area was wheel chair friendly. Loved the \ud83d\udc27 s. And some of the exhibits I was seeing for the first time. So the trip was value for money. one drawback is there is",
          "we loved it. the zoo was so well laid out with moats instead of fences and the animals were given as much freedom as possible living in mixed groups. the walk in forest was a giant room with trees and rivers and full of different birds, monkeys and small reptiles etc including",
          "I personally think that this zoo is a-mazing. The animals are amazing and most of there enclosures are big and perfectly imitate there natural habitats.I got so close to a penguin I... Sadly the elephant (yes) was in such a small space I almost cried\ud83d\ude16. Still super cool.",
          "A beautiful zoo in the center of Antwerp.We love it so much that we have a one-year subscription. Now there is a baby gorilla, so cute !!! And also there a baby zebra !!! The park is well maintained, flowers trees ponds..... A nice restaurant were you can have a cup of coffee or",
          "Lovely and clean zoo, with a great array of animals. Food and drinks available though-out. The only downside was the leopard. His cage wasn\u2019t very big and he was pacing back and forth looking very disturbed. Also when looking at the birds I stepped on a dead chick (their food)",
          "This zoo is surrounded by the older looks of the city and new flourished look of the beautiful animals. Very cheap and fun to go to on a day trip, before your shopping or right when you arrive. A VERY beautiful butterfly-garden as well.",
          "Sadly when I went the indoor bird enclosure and the butterfly enclosure were both shut, but there were plenty of other animals to see. I can't wait to go back after the building work is finished.",
          "For a zoo in the middle of the city is this a good day out. Price is a bit tot mutch, try to buy online with a discount. Drinkprices are expensive, but you can bring soda from home I think. A little baby gorilla was borne in 2018, he is so cute. It was a nice day out and we",
          "I've seen better but I still had a great time at this zoo. It was summer so we had nice animals there. It's somewhat big but you can do it in one day.",
          "One of the nicest zoos in the world. Hundreds of animals with lovely habitat. Large grounds in the center of the city and right by central train station of Antwerp.",
          "A lovely city centre zoo - expensive but worth it as there is plenty to see. The indoor sections were great - aquarium, reptile house and nocturnal animals. The chimps were the best part - wow! The elephant enclosure looked small, sparse and lacking stimulation unfortunately. We",
          "Pleasant fairly small zoo with a good variety of species. The enclosures are well designed and you can get really close to some animals which also looks well looked after. A bit disappointed that the bird house was closed, as we especially travelled from UK to see that bit.",
          "What a great place! Such an amazing location and unbeatable atmosphere-/ great combination of old and new. Price very steep",
          "Antwerp Zoo is a complete treat. They have a huge collection of animals, birds, reptiles, an aquarium and butterflies. They even have penguins and kangaroos. Antwerp Zoo is right next to the Antwerp station so even if you're here for a short while, you can manage to get in and",
          "One of the oldest in the world, reflected in the beautiful architecture and the stunning landscaping. Great history, fantastic sculptures, once the home of Rembrandt Bugatti. And of course, the fabulous collection of wildlife.",
          "Though the cost of maintaining wild animals in captivity is reflected by the price of the entrance, the investment might very well being be value for money. The English garden at the heart of the Zoo has been a pleasant leisure place for over 170 years. The homes of the animals",
          "a very nice visit, the zoo have a good set up, easy to visit and with some interesting animals. close to the center",
          "I believe its one of the oldest zoo's with a beautiful entrance you will just fall in love not only with the animals but with the architect. Situated within the centre of the city you wouldn't know you where in Antwerp you can easily get lost within the sheer beauty and forget",
          "It was a magical day out with the family. A definite visit if in Antwerp. The zoo map was easy to read and the grounds and facilities were extremely clean. The kids had so much fun as there were a vast amount of animals and reptiles to see. We absolutely loved the day out and",
          "A good variety of animals to see up close here and it will take the best part of a day to get around. Good, modern restaurant with plenty of choice. A lot of animals are in small pens though and this was quite sad to see.",
          "Not only a zoo, a monument, a park a playground and a wonderful place to go for a coffee and a pancake!",
          "After some days at the bungalow park we decided to go to the zoo. A very nice combi ticket to the zoo was easily bought. It is in the towncenter next to the trainstation, just a 5 min walk. Even in the cold winter there is enough to see and the little one enjoyed the animals.",
          "We went there with our daughter 2 years old it was great as we had a beautiful day and all the animals were out of their cages! The entertaining with the sea lions was also great as the animals where not forced to participate if they didn't want to, it would be nice if the",
          "It is fun and nice for a family trip with kids, but...! The cages are too small for most animals, it\u2019s sad! And they don\u2019t even have real plants or trees in some cages! Fake trees for some apes, and fake flowers in the terrarium. The animals are very exposed too, and some look",
          "It is a great place of walking because everything is green. I don\u2019t like the zoo\u2019s because the animals suffers a lot. For that i give it only 4 stars.",
          "We went to see the Chinese Light Festival in Antwerp Zoo and it was a super experience. Very colourful, varied, lights all around. Its something, not to be missed.",
          "This is a very nice old zoo with new and old artwork in the beautiful landscaped garden of the Zoo. Beside the large collection of animals there are some nice playgrounds for the children to play in. This zoo is part of a breading plan, so it helps to protect the animals /",
          "This zoo is very easy to reach, as it is next to the main station of Antwerp, making it a great day trip destination. Quite a few rearrangements have taken place, and more improvements are under way. Considering the location, it has a rather limited space and no possibility of",
          "Strange that it\u2019s in the middle of the city and by the train station! It\u2019s a calm place in the middle of bustle! We loved it. Highly recommended",
          "In 1843 this was one of the first Zoo's in Europe. Just next door of the Central Station (also worth a visit !), this beautiful park houses a unique collection of animals. The architecture has always been exotic but has been systematically modernised in order to guarantee the",
          "Last year I went to see chinalight in the zoo from Antwerp it was beautiful even it was an evening from heavy rain Yesterday evening I went again so beautiful also the performances very good done It is a different way to feel the zoo by evening It is still open for the public",
          "We visited the zoo with our 2 year old son during a day with cold and rain. You need to go well dressed and prepared for possible rain, a rain cover would be nice if you have a stroller. overall it is worth visiting, very well maintened nice gardens and surrounding areas, places",
          "Im not fan of jailed animals, and this zoo is no different of others. Classic zoo installed in a very nice gardens. Has a good collection of animals, living in small areas. Its a good half day distraction if you around Antwerp center, just next to the Central train station.",
          "this zoo has undergone major changes in the past years, from offering all kind of species going to less species and giving the animals more space. The garden is always very well maintained and people working in the zoo are very dedicated to their jobs. A must see when visiting",
          "Wow..more than expected. The first we can see the building with full of butterfly so beautiful. And there are so much animals. My family's favourite place is big aquarium, so blue, calm amazing..",
          "Looking for a serene place to recharge for an afternoon I read that the grounds and buildings of tos city centre zoo are preserved as national monuments. I\u2019m a bit fussy about zoos, but as this one is part of the European breeding programme and has several successes I thought",
          "This is the biggest zoo in Belgium and most surprising to find it right in the centre of the city next to the impressive Central Station. Although the cost of the entrance ticket is 26.50 euro and 25.50 euro for over 60`s we still found this to be excellent value considering",
          "My boyfriend and I went on a little trip to Antwerp a few weeks ago and of course we couldn\u2019t miss out on the Zoo. The Zoo has such a funny location, next to the station, but that didn\u2019t even mean it was small. In fact, it was a huge Zoo! All the animals had a lot of living",
          "Eady to find and located on the side of the central train station. The grounds are very relaxing and attractive. There is live music played at the gazebo in the evening. Quite expensive tickets though for a small zoo (see pix).",
          "This zoo is just amazing. I loved how the animals were taken care of. The zoo is home to a big variety of species and has several buildings and statues with historical value. The gardens are lovely too. Free Wi-Fi inside.",
          "One of the best zoo I have ever been. It is like in fairy tale. You can see flamingos and room with butterflies, what is unusual. Worth to visit!",
          "Beautiful zoo, with stunning displays of animals. The place has a rich history - it\u2019s the 7th oldest zoo in the world - and its combination of modernity and heritage makes it one of the very best in the world.",
          "The Antwerp zoo is a nice place to spend an afternoon with your children. It is nicely designed, lots of greenery. You can bring your own picnic or eat in one of their restaurants. We had pizza at the Latteria, it was good. Don\u2019t expect them to be as in Italy, but they were good",
          "I have known the Zoo for ages, and it was good to be back after some time to see the changes and the evergreens. Now as an ex Antwerp citizen of course I was a bit sceptical about the big event that Pairi Daiza is. And the fact that the most honorable scientific institution",
          "Don't go there! The animals are still in tiny cages like some 20 years ago and the gorillas must be depressed and lonely. I would never recommend this place to anybody. Please do something about it, Zoo Antwerp!",
          "Very old, but modernized zoo in the middle of the city center, next door to the Centraal Station, train station. All the big and small, known animals, one next to the other are represented. You don't have to walk for miles, which is very good for children, strollers and",
          "First the negatives: admission is too expensive (25 euro for an adult, around 20 for children). Some animal cages, particularly those of apes and monkeys, seem too small. The positives: situated next to the train station, it is very conveniently located. It seems to emphasize",
          "Went on a date with my girlfriend to this Zoo. We had a lovely day looking at all kinds of animals. The Zoo has an easy pathway you can follow by numbers. Would definently recommend 10/10",
          "By the time you must be wondering what is the price? It is of approximately 56 euros for a senior and a child. Expensive, right! Your first impression is to not go there, but think! The animals in this zoo are fantastic, including hippopotamus, lions, sea-lions, giraffes,",
          "The zoo is nicely laid out & has an interactive area for children. The butterfly house is amazing. The grounds are beautiful & well kept. There are ample facilities & places to get a drink or snack. The zoo is brilliantly located right next to the Antwerp Central station, making",
          "This being the day of our anniversary, we spent it in the amazing zoo which, again, we could see from our window. One of the best I have been to in my never ending search to make best friends with apes and gorillas. Apart from the fact that is bang in the centre of the city,",
          "This zoo is amazing!!! We are on holiday from the uk This zoo is the best zoo I have been to . Lots of different types of animals to see and some that I haven\u2019t seen in zoos before like the tree kangaroo and koala. The zoo is huge all the enclosures are spacious and modern, the",
          "The zoo has beautifully kept grounds and lots of well housed, happy looking animals. A bit more pricey than Stuttgart, Munich and some of the other city zoo's we've been too but still nice. Lots of information in English, which is great and we didn't get to see everything in 3.5",
          "Usually I am not a city zoo fan as the enclosures are to small, this one is beautiful though. Outstanding selection of animals, very clean and animals seem all very well taken care off. Apart from Singapore the nicest city zoo I have been too.",
          "At least 3, preferably 4 hours are needed to justify the entrance price (concessionary discounts seemed rather stingy too) but give this city centre zoo that commitment and it will repay you. A wonderful range of traditional crowd pleasers, biologically interesting exhibits and",
          "I spent more than four hours in the Antwerp Zoo. There is a variety of animals and birds in the zoo and everything is well decorated and organized. Particularly, the butterfly section is so attractive that I wish to go there again only to spend more time in order to observe the",

          "Went here to pass some time with my cousin on Sunday. It's a beautiful little zoo with a wide range of animals. Highlight for me was the sea lion show! Only negative I have is the lack of toilets and the entry price is very expensive.",
          "We went here using some tokens my grandpa had for free entry 40 years ago! I am pleased to say that they are still accepting them. The gift shop is on the outside of the zoo, which is convenient if you are like us and your kid is still talking about a toy the next day so you",
          "We were a bit taken aback to find a zoo in the middle of a city so weren't expecting much - we were sooo mistaken. This zoo is massive. They have lions, koalas elephants, apes and all sorts of other beautiful animals. They have one of the best aquariums we have seen. Would",
          "A very well maintained zoo, very good value for money, could easily spend the whole day there, lots of animals that I had not seen before like koalas and armadillos, plenty of places to get a drink and a restaurant for food as well. Located right outside Antwerp train station",

          "The Zoo is not the biggest Zoo or the newest but they are workig hard on it. A lot of the animal cages are brand new. I especially liked the nighthouse and do not forget the aquarium. It also is not to big but beautifully calm. The butterflygarten is a must see. And ofcourse the",
          "What a great experience! I really enjoyed my visit very much, despite the crowd. I particularly liked the butterflies house, the bear cub playing with its mum, the aviary and the new aquarium. I also appreciated the old buildings still standing that give a special, nostalgic",
          "We have been to a lot of zoo\u2019s & it is very rare you get to see pretty much all of the animals out in a day, there is really a great variety of species here, some of which we haven\u2019t seen in the uk & all the animals Seem really happy in their environments",
          "Very nice zoo tucked away adjacent to the beautiful train station. This is a very beautiful zoo located near the train station. Nicely landscaped with interesting number of animals. Being from middle America I found it rather ironic that I would find the American Cardinal as one",
          "This is a wonderful, small zoo adjacent to the central train station. We couldn't help but check it out given its location, and because we arrived early to catch our train down to Luxembourg.",
          "The zoo is right besdie central station and you can wander in and see the pink brolgas. The gift shop is stacked with amazing gift ideas but we were too late in the day to see all the animals.",
          "The Zoo is very accessible from Brussels by train. The zoo is literally next to Antwerp Central Station and sign posted in the station itself, to ensure that you go to the most convenient exit. It is a great attraction and it is difficult to single out the best things, although",
          "It was a decision made overnight to visit Antwerp from Brussels. Situated just beside the station it was very easy to find.It was well signposted within the zoo. All the animals children expect to see were there including a good sized aquarium which I have not seen in many other",

          "Rented the acquarium for a walking dinner / reception. Mesmerizing place where you can have a good discussion with business associates and enjoy nature at the same time. You\u2019re surrounded by exotic as well as native fish species living their life. Who\u2019s watching who? Good",
          "We came here in April and had a lovely day. Animals looked happy and well looked after (lots of upgrades happening to enclosures) personal highlights were the butterfly house, the nocturnal animals and the elephants. We had lunch at one of the cafes, they had a good selection of",

          "First of all, the Zoo is super easy to get to if travelling by train - you literally turn left as you exit the station (maybe a few lefts, depending on where you exit from) and it's right there! A bit spendy (26\u20ac if you don't pre-buy tickets online) but it's very nicely kept and",
          "Lots to see and do. Animals clearly well looked after. Spread out over a huge area so you never feel the crowds are too much. Well worth the price of a ticket",

          "We weren't going to visit the zoo as we thought it would be small and not worth the entrance fee; but as we were trying to stay close to the train station decided to give it a go. We loved it. It felt so much bigger than we expected and had several distinct areas.Hard to say",
          "Decent zoo, kids have a lot of fun. To me the price seems a bit too much expensive co considering what is offered and other european's structures",
          "This zoo isn't incredibly large, but it is big enough to spend a nice afternoon wandering around. They have enough of an assortment of animals to keep kids and adults interested. The grounds are well maintained. I only wish that there was a larger assortment of snacks and",

          "This was a day well spent, I had so much fun here with my boyfriend. A huge variety of animals to see and one of the best zoos I have been to, particularly enjoyed how well you could see the animals (much less bars or glass displays).",
          "I visited here while spending the weekend in Antwerp between 2 business weeks. There is quite a lot of building works going on at the moment which meant a lot of the park was closed off, not really worth the money considering the state of the park at the moment. Some of the",

          "The zoo has made nice improvements, renovations, more playtime for children, new walk routes, curious what it will be when everything will be finished. Nice aquarium, butterflygarden, ...",
          "Firstly I found the cost off putting but managed a discount with one of the cards you pick up around town. First visit was butterfly's and that was good. Then as we followed the map things were closed for restructuring entered buffalo way expecting to see buffalo but it was",
          "The zoo of Antwerp has always had a certain importance. It is a big zoo and you have to take at least some 4 hours to visit it. There are a lot of visits inside as the night animals, reptiles, aquariums, monkeys and butterflies... to name some of them. It is very clean, the",
          "i loved the zoo so much, they have lots of beautiful animals like monkeys (variety of monkeys) birds elephants... If you want to visit the zoo you have to spend time there coz it is very big and you have to walk also too much but the plants and the lovely gardens make you",

          "This was one of the highlights of my one month vacation in Belgium. We were amazed when we realized how big it was and how fast time flew by. We spent a good 5 hours and it never got boring. Many different animals and species. Especially the butterfly garden was overwhelming and",

          "This Zoo is located right in the city center next to the central station and close to the shopping street (meir). It has a lot of beautiful old buildings and is a nice 'getaway' from the city. This is what makes it so special, but then again the downside is that they have",

          "You can easily combine a visit to the magnificent central station and the Antwerp zoo, because both attractions are right next to each other. I have visited the zoo many times and it has changed a lot compared to my childhood. The zoo is sitting right in the city center, so the",
          "As the person who don't like any type of zoos I must say that this one is just one of a kind! It was found in the 17th century! There are lots of pretty gardens and parks, comfortable relax corners, playground for the little ones. Just work of art in planning and architectural",
          "I have been to many zoos before and thought that the night time animal section was one of the best I have seen. There was work going on as they were building a new enclosure for the Giraffes and Zebras. The animals were only in 2's or 3's as the space is limited being in the",
          "There was far more to do than I expected after reading the reviews. The performance by the sea lion was exceptional, especially his imitation of Jaws. A display by birds of Prey was good and children were encouraged to hold out their hands to receive the final bird, as it flew",
          "To be honest I don't really like the zoo. It is very nice in the middle of Antwerp but if you put this zoo against planckendael I would recommend going there! Antwerp zoo is small, and the animals for me are in small cages. While in Planckendael you have the openess, a lot of",
          "This is not the best zoo I have ever visited but is probably the most historic. It is very old and as such is in need of constant maintenance and upgrading. This means there is always building works somewhere in the zoo. I was very impressed with the butterfly house. The Animals",
          "Every time I visit the ZOO (+- once a year) there is something new or an improvement. You can see that the ticket money goes into the ZOO! The area is little bit cramped because of the limits of the place - it is in the middle of the city unlike other ZOOs in the world. It is",
          "Ideal for family with children, nice quiet areas around the zoo to get a bit of relaxation. Gardens and property are superbly kept up and kept clean. The new aquarium installed at Easter unfortunatly was scratched at several places to my disapointment. Unfortunatly many of the",
          "Not the biggest zoo in the world but also not the busiest. Absolutely chucked it down with rain multiple times but we were happy to spend time sheltering under the trees in this lovely, quaint place. The kids loved it and i'd be happy to go back anytime. No corporate hard sell.",
          "We were pleasantly surprised bynew housings for the animals. This makes it worth returning to the zoo every 2 years. The entrance is competely changed as the new main restaurant is now in the middle of the zoo. Also new housing for several animals makes it more attractive for",
          "Very nice park to spend a day with family. Animals are well kept. A little expansive but..really nice",
          "It's really sad and embarrassing to see the bad situation of life that the animals have. Many small cages while the public open areas are huge, empty and ugly. All made in order to please people and with out the slitest attention to the animals. The cages are*decorated* with",
          "Although the Zoo is under repair the exhibits and staff were very friendly. The only issue we had was with the price being just that little to expensive for a family of 3 (67 Euros) if it was 50 Euros that would have been better. However I do recognize the need to make money to",
          "This zoo is pure nostalgia to me. I went there every year with my parents watching the dolphins (my favorite), the swimming ice bears, the sea lions, the black bears en elephants, gorillas etc... Then they gave away all large animals to their sister zoo Plankendael because they",
          "We had a great time at the zoo. The layout is good, the animals all looked clean and well looked after and there was a good variety. The gardens were also very nice with lots of flowers. A good way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "Although we didn't actually visit the zoo, we did go on the Ferris wheel close to the entrance. This was reasonably priced at \u20ac6 for an adult. The Ferris wheel went very high and gave great views over the city including into the zoo where we could see the flamingoes, and of the",

          "There is not a whole lot to do in Antwerp but visiting the Zoo is an exception. Easily located right next to the train station and approximately 10-15 minutes walk from Grote Markt. Ticket prices are pretty much in line with other major European zoos and aquaria and the park",
          "I love animals and I think they are well cared for in this zoo, but they don't offer enough variety (in animals), the main restaurant was mediocre and the free map of the zoo was irritatingly unclear. I have seen much better zoos in other countries, and even in this one I think",
          "Wonderful zoo to explore. One of the best. Lots of indoor animals too, in case you go on a rainy day. I love the way there is numerous views on the animals from various angles. It's like a labyrinth that you explore. You don't know what you'll find around the corner. I almost",

          "The Zoo is interesting for any age : from 1 to 101 years . the Zoo has undergone a sensational makeover since my last visit . You now have a sense of space and animal welfare . The animal shelters are now largely adapted and modernized. Highlights include the impressive",
          "On this moment there is a huge construction going on but there is enough space to look to the nice spots for the animals. Animals look healthy and have a lot of space. Its nice to visit with children. It is an oase in the centre of the city. I always enjoy strolling in the zoo.",

          "The Antwerp Zoo is a nice place to visit,.... when there is no construction going on. But now it gives you the impression that the whole place is a yard and the animals are hidden somewhere in a corner. Definitely not worth the money at this moment. The free coffee offered is a",
          "I went to Antwerp zoo with my husband and mother in law whilst staying in the city for a few days. We had a lovely afternoon enjoying the enclosures and the scenic gardens with the amazing background of the central station. It was easy to buy tickets, there are ticket machines",
          "The zoo would have received 5* but there were large scale building and restoration going on during the visit so numerous sites were unfortunately closed. The zoo was well laid out, it was interactive and had a clean and inviting food area. There were things to walk up, down,",

          "The zoo has a good bit of construction going on right now. Unfortunately it decided to rain a great deal the day we visited so there was lots of mud to dodge. The grounds are beautiful. Many of the animals weren't out and about, maybe due to the weather. The aquarium section was",

          "19 euros per person, but you can spend quite a bit of time. They are building several new projects so there is construction and a few animals are on vacation until construction is done. The gardens are beautiful, we went on a Monday so no crowds. A great zoo in the middle of the",

          "Was amazed to find the zoo in the heart of the city and just behind the central station. The zoo is well kept though when we visited some renovation was in progress. Rare species of different animals were well kept. Name an animal and we could see it there. Worth visiting.",
          "There is no mention that I can see that there is alot of construction work going on and not all the animals are viewable. We visited on the 4th of may. Don't book online as if you go to the desk at the moment its nineteen euros for an adult instead of twenty four. Also note",
          "Great location, right in the center of the city. Easy access. Well organized and clean. Children where happy to see all these animal. Medium to small size zoo however",
          "There is a lot of remodelling going on within the grounds of the zoo, so many areas are currently fenced off. However the existing landscaping is quite beautiful. (I guess that might be because of the spring bulb plantings.) I think the area that gave the most enjoyment was",
          "This Zoo is actually work in progress. They are rebuilding and restructuring. We go to a cup of coffee for the inconvenience. We love the Lions den, the Penguins house and the reptile house. It is amazing to see that they can simulate a thunderstorm. Also look at the night",
          "It's really fun and cool. I don't visit it every year. But every time I go there. I'm a kid all over again. Too bad entry and food inside is expensive as hell. Otherwise I would definitely go more often. Great place to come with your kids. Met them learn to respect wildlife and",
          "They are renovating the Zoo. A lot of the animals were moved to other places. It was a nice stroll, because it was a lovely sunny day and all the flowers were blooming. But I could have taken a free stroll in the park instead of paying \u20ac24 for 2 people. They did give us a",
          "It was unrenovation the time we spend there but very nice still. Some of the animals was less excited that others. In general great experience!! We received free coupons for entrance in summer when the zoo is full done. Really nice of them!!!!",

          "While you're visiting Central station, do yourself a pleasure, visit the zoo of Antwerp, you will discover off course animals of different species, but look at the architectural beauty of the zoo. Take your time, relax en feel it, you're in another timezone.",
          "Half of the exhibits had no animals. The ZOO was a muddy construction Zone. The Elephant would probably commit suicide if she could, her pen was so deplorable. The only portion of the ZOO that was impressive was the new Aquarium, everything else was 1-Star.",
          "This is a tiny zoo and it is currently under major renovation. However, we saw an amazing collection of animals in its compound. There is the ferocious great ape and many different types of monkeys. It also has a butterflies gardens, in it with beautify orchids in bloom. There",

          "As a 19th-century zoo, now remodelled so as not to be jerks to animals, this is the classic, kids'-book kind of zoo I've never got to visit before. I was continually swarmed by children on a couple of school trips, but that only added to the experience. Not ideal for wanting to",

          "We visited on New Year's Day as it was one of the only places open. Our ticket also included a free coffee or tea at the cafe which was nice. The zoo was undergoing some serious renovations and changes when we visited but there were still a lot of animals and enclosures to see.",

          "Antwerp zoo, located just next to the Central Station, is worth a visit. The variety of animals and birds is amazing. Do note that some areas are being remade and are closed to the public until somewhere in 2016.",

          "I was a little reticent, looking at the renovations and how big I assumed the Zoo would be, I thought it may have been a waste of time. Glad I went though, the ongoing work is distracting and did seem to confuse their numbering system (guide to follow when walking around) but",
          "Architecturally this has to be the finest zoo around. Stunning buildings housing beautiful creatures by a magnificent railway station! Spent the whole day there which surprised me, didn't think there would be enough for a whole day, but was wrong Would gladly have scored a 5",
          "We discovered the zoo by complete accident. Old style from our type of zoos but our son loved seeing animals and especially of those we wouldn't have here. Was under construction when we went but cannot wait to visit again",

          "Do not go to the Zoo of Antwerp at this time as you'll have trouble to find the animals. No signs to lead you to then because of renovation works everywhere... We do not understand why they had to do so much works at the same time. Everyone got lost as many alleys lead to",

          "The Antwerp city zoo, one of the very first in Belgium, really beautiful to have a walk in if it's sunny, next to the station and easy accessible. Although they do their best, its restricted in space, and for some of us, restricted for the animals, yet you do get a good look at",
          "The zoo is small and nice, very close to the Central Station. You could see not only the animals but you can assist also to their feeding and to spectacles. At the entrance you get a map of the park and a programe withe activities in order to know what is happening where",
          "My boyfriend and I had a great afternoon here - really good range of animals from cute penguins and sea lions to Bears and birds. We loved the spectacled bear - one of the best animals of the day. It was relatively quiet when we went as it was a school day but lovely all the",
          "Three things kids like: trains, animals and fish. You can do them all in one spot in Antwerp with lots of restaurants around. Adjacent to the Central train station, the Antwerp Zoo is a must for families with children. Good anytime of the year and the cost is reasonable. So",
          "Zoo claims to be one of oldest in Europe. Most likely it is true. However that means it is very small for a zoo with carefully picked animal selection. But the space planning is nice, so the animals don't seem to suffer. The location a few steps away from train station makes it",
          "This zoo is wonderful, amazingly set out and full of wonderful animals! Me and my partner absolutely loved it and spent the whole day there. Was very easy to get to as it is located just outside the train station and wasnt too expensive. Only negative thing to say was that the",
          "One of the oldest zoo's in Europe. Very well kept and updated. Located right next to the Central (Train) Station and Keyserlei. Offer family packages and discounts in combination with your train ticket.",
          "The Zoo of Antwerp is a special place. I think best described as a nice green parc with lots of old trees to walk through and on top of that, you can admire the animals also living in this parc. The other thing I like about this Zoo, is, that it has a sister Zoo in Mechelen area",
          "Amazing to see what you can organize on a very restricted area in beside Antwerp Central Station. In every season the flowers are magnificent. Large Planckendael extension between Antwerp and Brussels.",
          "Very big zoo, i've never seen bigger zoo, so much animals, very spacious. We've been there for 4 hours, you need time in there, but definately worth it. Maybe ticket price is a little bit too high but you see that just once :)",
          "Small zoo but beautifully organized and equipped. Not in the same league as the San Diego zoo but definitely worth the time when in Antwerp.",
          "The zoo is quite easy to access using public transit and it is a beautiful park with great exhibits. It is a bit expensive since children are not free like they are at many other European zoos. Be sure to catch the sea lion show!",
          "We visited the zoo with our grandchildren arriving by train in Antwerp Central station. We ordered combined train/zoo tickets via the NMBS website. The current station was built in the period 1895-1905 is well worth a visit in its own right The zoo is next to the station and is",
          "We spent the morning at the Zoo. It's very compact but worth a visit. I think it's comparable in cost to UK zoo's. Look out for the ticket machine's to buy ticket just inside the entrance instead of standing in the queue for the booth to buy tickets.",
          "Nice selection of animals , also keeps on investing in new environments for their animals and they try to keep an eye to the past as well .",
          "we had a great day at antwerp Zoo. Very interesting and entertaining parc for young and old. They have a very nice aquarium with corals. A sea-lion show, a show with birds of prey.",
          "We had a great day at Antwerp zoo, we followed the parking instructions on the zoo website which were very useful but we had to walk through a slightly dodgy area before getting to the zoo. The zoo is fab, it has all the animals that you expect to see at a zoo and more besides",
          "Set in an attractive park there are numerous animals and an impressive aquarium and reptile house. This is not a large zoo and at \u20ac 45 per couple was not cheap but the layout and manner in which the animals were displayed made for an enjoyable experience. This is an old zoo in",
          "This is one of the best--perhaps THE best--zoos we have ever visited. The zoo is well organized and well maintained. Interpretative signage is bilingual and idiomatic. The crowds were enthusiastic and well behaved. the grounds were nicely landscaped.",
          "That is all I got to say...Fantastic trip!. Whole day trip sorted. Right by the station is an amazing Zoo. Reasonably priced, lots of animals as you would expect. A seal show and opportunites to feed camels and the lions (lions only joking) Many vending machines for snacks and",
          "Caveat: zoos disturb me. I never choose to go but have been about 5 times in my adult life. I spent a day here with several small children, this is right across the central station which is also a must see and as far as city zoos go, this was alright. It doesn't take long to",
          "Well the most beautiful zoo in the world, build in the 19th century making it one of the oldest in existence. Fantastic architecture, parklike lay-out, very well maintained and a big variety of animals ranging from bugs to elephants. The elephant pavilion is like an old Egyptian",
          "So much to see in this beautiful city zoo although not all parts seem easily accessible for people in wheelchairs or families with kids in trolleys. Very well maintained and still under development. Prices for food and drinks steep as expected. Parking fee very modest at 4 euro",
          "The zoo has beautiful gardens and enclosures. The animals are well cared for. The night enclosure was great.",
          "Read the reviews before we visited and expected to be there 2 to 3 hours. We ended up spending the full day there! Turn right outside the magnificent Antwerp Central station and there it is. If travelling with SNCB by the way the B Excursion inclusive rail and entry package can",
          "The is just next to the central station making it the first thing you see when arriving in Antwerp. It is old and has a good variety. However, the small area makes much of the animals locked up in small cages. They are not properly kept. I guess Antwerp should relocate it and",
          "The zoo is very nice with lots os small paths, gardening and big trees. It keeps the 19th Century look which is lovely. The problem is that most big animals are kept in small spaces (the lion, jaguar, panther...) a really sad experience, even my kids said the animals looked",
          "It is a 19th century zoo ... I have NEVER seen a zoo with big animals looking so sad, inside their incredibly small cages (especially the big apes). So sad ...",
          "It is every time joy when you visit Antwerp zoo. You will be amazed how big it is while it is located in the very centre of Antwerp! For all age groups, believe this one worth a visit. There is also an hourly show (or a show every two hours) for seals, I did not have the",

          "The oldest zoo in the world is incredible. Where do you start? How do you end? The architecture and history surrounding God's amazing creatures are like a dream come true!",
          "A super half day visit with well planned enclosures which were not over-crowded. A good selection of animals in a pretty area. Right next to the station which itself is worthy of exploring.",
          "I think we never been to such a poor Zoo in our life. It has nothing to do with a number of animals in it. Those poor animals are closed in a very small places. They even look poor and not healthy. All Zoo stinks of mold and ...... Moreover overpriced. One adult + 1 child - 40",
          "This is a real nice zoo with original buildings. The renovated aquarium area is wonderful. The free otter show is real cool for kids! It's worth buying the family pass if you plan to visit more than once as it gives you access to Planckendael Zoo too.",

          "Whilst not that large due to being in the centre of the city, this Zoo provides high quality exhibits. All the animals appear active and in superb condition. Whilst the obvious attractions such as elephants, lions and tigers are there, the focus is clearly on conserving and",
          "Very well maintained zoo. Animals seem to be in more open areas and I have seen in many other smaller zoos. The Sea Lion Show was particularly enjoyable. The B'exursion ticket from Brussels works like a charm for a half day or full day tour.",
          "Fantastic zoo a few steps beside the train station . Great playgrounds and animals we never seen. Quite expensive but still worth it .",
          "as a kid I came to the zoo gazing at the most exotic animals. Did I know that they were housed in cages that were as far from their habitat as Pluto is from the sun. Now, I go with my grandchildren and see lions in an almost natural environment, pengiuns almost hopping onto my",

          "It's an old fashioned zoo, it's a romantic park, it's a collection of unusual historic buildings and it's right next to the station. While compact in size, there is quite a lot to see, and the 19th century atmosphere of the place is well preserved. The famous Egyptian temple is",

          "The Jardin Zoo is in Antwerp city centre in a narrow track of land beside the railway station. If it were just a city park with small animals then a stroll through the well maintained gardens would be lovely. BUT it isn't. It is home to large wild animals - elephants, giraffes,",

          "In the middle of Antwerp, next to the marvelous railway station, you will find the Antwerp Zoo. It\u2019s a great place to visit with a beautiful park and some intriguing locations to visit. Animals living during the night are an adventure for kids\u2026 dark and mysterious. Watching",

          "Its a city zoo, from a time where animals where put on display, that means space is limited and the current challenge for the zoo is upgrading it to make the animals comfortable. This is very visual here, you can see the difference between the newer sections and older parts.",
          "I love visiting zoos! While the Antwerp zoo is small, it is well done and has a great variety of animals from all over the world to experience!",
          "When I was going to Antwerp the last thing I was ready to see was zoo. I don't know why, but the zoo was definitely unexpected. I decided to visit it and must be honest - I liked it. Even though I'm not like to watch animals in cages, a lot of representatives of different breeds",
          "I've visited Antwerp several times over the past 25 years and never realised it had a zoo. And a fantastic zoo it is too. From Lions to Rhino's, giraffes to snakes or Monkeys to a brown bear, Antwerp Zoo has it all. Situated right next door to Grand central station, the Zoo",
          "The entrance is 22 EUR for an adult, but even in a bit of hurry and not browsing all of it spent 2h there.The penguins (S-African, outside) are so close you could touch them (but noone did). Plenty of monkeys, a butterfly house, reptile house, bird hous and a nice aquarium!",

          "This ZOO takes 1-3 hours based on how meticulous you are going from one corner to the other and visiting each habitat. The strongest point is the seal show and a restaurant. Also the old style of architecture is very interesting. On the other hand it is limiting the ZOO, today",

          "Not an afternoon filler, but certainly worth your while to have a look. The zoo dates from beginning of the past centuary and a lot of the quarters still breath that spirit though they are constantly renewing and improving everrything to make the stay of the animals as pleasant",

        "wiki": "Sir Peter Paul Rubens (; Dutch: [\u02c8ryb\u0259(n)s]; 28 June 1577 \u2013 30 May 1640) was a Flemish artist and diplomat. He is considered the most influential artist of the Flemish Baroque tradition. Rubens's highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, colour, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the Counter-Reformation. Rubens was a painter producing altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and history paintings of mythological and allegorical subjects.  He was also a prolific designer of cartoons for the Flemish tapestry workshops and of frontispieces for the publishers in Antwerp.\nIn addition to running a large workshop in Antwerp that produced paintings popular with nobility and art collectors throughout Europe, Rubens was a classically educated humanist scholar and diplomat who was knighted by both Philip IV of Spain and Charles I of England. Rubens was a prolific artist. The catalogue of his works by Michael Jaff\u00e9 lists 1,403 pieces, excluding numerous copies made in his workshop.His commissioned works were mostly history paintings, which included religious and mythological subjects, and hunt scenes. He painted portraits, especially of friends, and self-portraits, and in later life painted several landscapes. Rubens designed tapestries and prints, as well as his own house. He also oversaw the ephemeral decorations of the royal entry into Antwerp by the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria in 1635.  He wrote a book with illustrations of the palaces in Genoa, which was published in 1622 as Palazzi di Genova.  The book was influential in spreading the Genoese palace style in Northern Europe.  Rubens was an avid art collector and had one of the largest collections of art and books in Antwerp.  He was also an art dealer and is known to have sold an important number of art objects to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham.He was one of the last major artists to make consistent use of wooden panels as a support medium, even for very large works, but he used canvas as well, especially when the work needed to be sent a long distance. For altarpieces he sometimes painted on slate to reduce reflection problems.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nRubens was born in [Siegen]] to Jan Rubens and Maria Pypelincks. His father, a Calvinist, and mother fled Antwerp for Cologne in 1568, after increased religious turmoil and persecution of Protestants during the rule of the Habsburg Netherlands by the Duke of Alba. Rubens was baptised in Cologne at St Peter's Church.\nJan Rubens became the legal adviser (and lover) of Anna of Saxony, the second wife of William I of Orange, and settled at her court in Siegen in 1570, fathering her daughter Christine who was born in 1571. Following Jan Rubens's imprisonment for the affair, Peter Paul Rubens was born in 1577. The family returned to Cologne the next year. In 1589, two years after his father's death, Rubens moved with his mother Maria Pypelincks to Antwerp, where he was raised as a Catholic.\nReligion figured prominently in much of his work, and Rubens later became one of the leading voices of the Catholic Counter-Reformation style of painting (he had said \"My passion comes from the heavens, not from earthly musings\").\n\n\n=== Apprenticeship ===\n\nIn Antwerp, Rubens received a Renaissance humanist education, studying Latin and classical literature. By fourteen he began his artistic apprenticeship with Tobias Verhaeght. Subsequently, he studied under two of the city's leading painters of the time, the late Mannerist artists Adam van Noort and Otto van Veen. Much of his earliest training involved copying earlier artists' works, such as woodcuts by Hans Holbein the Younger and Marcantonio Raimondi's engravings after Raphael. Rubens completed his education in 1598, at which time he entered the Guild of St. Luke as an independent master.\n\n\n=== Italy (1600\u20131608) ===\nIn 1600 Rubens travelled to Italy. He stopped first in Venice, where he saw paintings by Titian, Veronese, and Tintoretto, before settling in Mantua at the court of Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga. The colouring and compositions of Veronese and Tintoretto had an immediate effect on Rubens's painting, and his later, mature style was profoundly influenced by Titian. With financial support from the Duke, Rubens travelled to Rome by way of Florence in 1601. There, he studied classical Greek and Roman art and copied works of the Italian masters.  The Hellenistic sculpture Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons was especially influential on him, as was the art of Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci. He was also influenced by the recent, highly naturalistic paintings by Caravaggio.\n\nRubens later made a copy of Caravaggio's Entombment of Christ and recommended his patron, the Duke of Mantua, to purchase The Death of the Virgin (Louvre). After his return to Antwerp he was instrumental in the acquisition of The Madonna of the Rosary (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) for the St. Paul's Church in Antwerp.  During this first stay in Rome, Rubens completed his first altarpiece commission, St. Helena with the True Cross for the Roman church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme.\nRubens travelled to Spain on a diplomatic mission in 1603, delivering gifts from the Gonzagas to the court of Philip III. While there, he studied the extensive collections of Raphael and Titian that had been collected by Philip II. He also painted an equestrian portrait of the Duke of Lerma during his stay (Prado, Madrid) that demonstrates the influence of works like Titian's Charles V at M\u00fchlberg (1548; Prado, Madrid). This journey marked the first of many during his career that combined art and diplomacy.\nHe returned to Italy in 1604, where he remained for the next four years, first in Mantua and then in Genoa and Rome. In Genoa, Rubens painted numerous portraits, such as the Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), and the portrait of Maria di Antonio Serra Pallavicini, in a style that influenced later paintings by Anthony van Dyck, Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough.\n\nHe illustrated books, which was published in 1622 as Palazzi di Genova. From 1606 to 1608, he was mostly in Rome when he received, with the assistance of Cardinal Jacopo Serra (the brother of Maria Pallavicini), his most important commission to date for the High Altar of the city's most fashionable new church, Santa Maria in Vallicella also known as the Chiesa Nuova.\nThe subject was to be St. Gregory the Great and important local saints adoring an icon of the Virgin and Child. The first version, a single canvas (now at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Grenoble), was immediately replaced by a second version on three slate panels that permits the actual miraculous holy image of the \"Santa Maria in Vallicella\" to be revealed on important feast days by a removable copper cover, also painted by the artist.Rubens's experiences in Italy continued to influence his work. He continued to write many of his letters and correspondences in Italian, signed his name as \"Pietro Paolo Rubens\", and spoke longingly of returning to the peninsula\u2014a hope that never materialized.\n\n\n=== Antwerp (1609\u20131621) ===\n\nUpon hearing of his mother's illness in 1608, Rubens planned his departure from Italy for Antwerp. However, she died before he arrived home. His return coincided with a period of renewed prosperity in the city with the signing of the Treaty of Antwerp in April 1609, which initiated the Twelve Years' Truce. In September 1609 Rubens was appointed as court painter by Albert VII, Archduke of Austria, and Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain, sovereigns of the Low Countries.\nHe received special permission to base his studio in Antwerp instead of at their court in Brussels, and to also work for other clients. He remained close to the Archduchess Isabella until her death in 1633, and was called upon not only as a painter but also as an ambassador and diplomat. Rubens further cemented his ties to the city when, on 3 October 1609, he married Isabella Brant, the daughter of a leading Antwerp citizen and humanist, Jan Brant.\n\nIn 1610 Rubens moved into a new house and studio that he designed. Now the Rubenshuis Museum, the Italian-influenced villa in the centre of Antwerp accommodated his workshop, where he and his apprentices made most of the paintings, and his personal art collection and library, both among the most extensive in Antwerp. During this time he built up a studio with numerous students and assistants. His most famous pupil was the young Anthony van Dyck, who soon became the leading Flemish portraitist and collaborated frequently with Rubens. He also often collaborated with the many specialists active in the city, including the animal painter Frans Snyders, who contributed the eagle to Prometheus Bound (c. 1611\u201312, completed by 1618), and his good friend the flower-painter Jan Brueghel the Elder.\nAnother house was built by Rubens to the north of Antwerp in the polder village of Doel, \"Hooghuis\" (1613/1643), perhaps as an investment. The \"High House\" was built next to the village church.\n\nAltarpieces such as The Raising of the Cross (1610) and The Descent from the Cross (1611\u20131614) for the Cathedral of Our Lady were particularly important in establishing Rubens as Flanders' leading painter shortly after his return. The Raising of the Cross, for example, demonstrates the artist's synthesis of Tintoretto's Crucifixion for the Scuola Grande di San Rocco in Venice, Michelangelo's dynamic figures, and Rubens's own personal style. This painting has been held as a prime example of Baroque religious art.Rubens used the production of prints and book title-pages, especially for his friend Balthasar Moretus, the owner of the large Plantin-Moretus publishing house, to extend his fame throughout Europe during this part of his career. In 1618, Rubens embarked upon a printmaking enterprise by soliciting an unusual triple privilege (an early form of copyright) to protect his designs in France, the Southern Netherlands, and United Provinces. He enlisted Lucas Vorsterman to engrave a number of his notable religious and mythological paintings, to which Rubens appended personal and professional dedications to noteworthy individuals in the Southern Netherlands, United Provinces, England, France, and Spain. With the exception of a few etchings, Rubens left the printmaking to specialists, who included Lucas Vorsterman, Paulus Pontius and Willem Panneels. He recruited a number of engravers trained by Christoffel Jegher, whom he carefully schooled in the more vigorous style he wanted. Rubens also designed the last significant woodcuts before the 19th-century revival in the technique.\n\n\n=== Marie de' Medici Cycle and diplomatic missions (1621\u20131630) ===\n\nIn 1621, the Queen Mother of France, Marie de' Medici, commissioned Rubens to paint two large allegorical cycles celebrating her life and the life of her late husband, Henry IV, for the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. The Marie de' Medici cycle (now in the Louvre) was installed in 1625, and although he began work on the second series it was never completed. Marie was exiled from France in 1630 by her son, Louis XIII, and died in 1642 in the same house in Cologne where Rubens had lived as a child.\n\nAfter the end of the Twelve Years' Truce in 1621, the Spanish Habsburg rulers entrusted Rubens with a number of diplomatic missions. While in Paris in 1622 to discuss the Marie de' Medici cycle, Rubens engaged in clandestine information gathering activities, which at the time was an important task of diplomats.  He relied on his friendship with Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc to get information on political developments in France.  Between 1627 and 1630, Rubens's diplomatic career was particularly active, and he moved between the courts of Spain and England in an attempt to bring peace between the Spanish Netherlands and the United Provinces.  He also made several trips to the northern Netherlands as both an artist and a diplomat.\nAt the courts he sometimes encountered the attitude that courtiers should not use their hands in any art or trade, but he was also received as a gentleman by many.  Rubens was raised by Philip IV of Spain to the nobility in 1624 and knighted by Charles I of England in 1630.  Philip IV confirmed Rubens's status as a knight a few months later.  Rubens was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Cambridge University in 1629.Rubens was in Madrid for eight months in 1628\u20131629. In addition to diplomatic negotiations, he executed several important works for Philip IV and private patrons. He also began a renewed study of Titian's paintings, copying numerous works including the Madrid Fall of Man (1628\u201329). During this stay, he befriended the court painter Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and the two planned to travel to Italy together the following year. Rubens, however, returned to Antwerp and Vel\u00e1zquez made the journey without him.\n\nHis stay in Antwerp was brief, and he soon travelled on to London where he remained until April 1630. An important work from this period is the Allegory of Peace and War (1629; National Gallery, London). It illustrates the artist's lively concern for peace, and was given to Charles I as a gift.\nWhile Rubens's international reputation with collectors and nobility abroad continued to grow during this decade, he and his workshop also continued to paint monumental paintings for local patrons in Antwerp. The Assumption of the Virgin Mary (1625\u20136) for the Cathedral of Antwerp is one prominent example.\n\n\n=== Last decade (1630\u20131640) ===\nRubens's last decade was spent in and around Antwerp. Major works for foreign patrons still occupied him, such as the ceiling paintings for the Banqueting House at Inigo Jones's Palace of Whitehall, but he also explored more personal artistic directions.\nIn 1630, four years after the death of his first wife Isabella, the 53-year-old painter married his first wife's niece, the 16-year-old H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fourment. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne inspired the voluptuous figures in many of his paintings from the 1630s, including The Feast of Venus (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), The Three Graces and The Judgment of Paris (both Prado, Madrid). In the latter painting, which was made for the Spanish court, the artist's young wife was recognized by viewers in the figure of Venus. In an intimate portrait of her, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fourment in a Fur Wrap, also known as Het Pelsken, Rubens's wife is even partially modelled after classical sculptures of the Venus Pudica, such as the Medici Venus.\n\nIn 1635, Rubens bought an estate outside Antwerp, the Steen, where he spent much of his time. Landscapes, such as his Ch\u00e2teau de Steen with Hunter (National Gallery, London) and Farmers Returning from the Fields (Pitti Gallery, Florence), reflect the more personal nature of many of his later works. He also drew upon the Netherlandish traditions of Pieter Bruegel the Elder for inspiration in later works like Flemish Kermis (c. 1630; Louvre, Paris).\n\n\n=== Death ===\n\nRubens died from heart failure a result of his chronic gout on 30 May 1640. He was interred in the Saint James' Church in Antwerp. A burial chapel for the artist and his family was built in the church. Construction on the chapel started in 1642 and was completed in 1650 when Cornelis van Mildert (the son of Rubens' friend, the sculptor Johannes van Mildert) delivered the altarstone.  The chapel is a marble altar portico with two columns framing the altarpiece of the 'Virgin and child with saints painted by Rubens himself. The painting expresses the basis tenets of the Counter Reformation through the figures of the Virgin and saints.  In the upper niche of the retable is a marble statue depicting the Virgin as the Mater Dolorosa whose heart is pierced by a sword, which was likely sculpted by Lucas Faydherbe, a pupil of Rubens.  The remains of Rubens' second wife Helena Fourment and two of her children (one of which fathered by Rubens) were later also laid to rest in the chapel.  Over the coming centuries about 80 descendants from the Rubens family were interred in the chapel.\nAt the request of canon van Parijs, Rubens' epitaph, written in Latin by his friend Gaspar Gevartius was chiselled on the chapel floor. In the tradition of the Renaissance, Rubens is compared in the epitaph to Apelles, the most famous painter of Greek Antiquity.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nHis biblical and mythological nudes are especially well-known. Painted in the Baroque tradition of depicting women as soft-bodied, passive, and highly sexualized beings, his nudes emphasize the concepts of fertility, desire, physical beauty, temptation, and virtue. Skillfully rendered, these paintings of nude women are thought by feminists to have been created to sexually appeal to his largely male audience of patrons. Additionally, Rubens was quite fond of painting full-figured women, giving rise to terms like 'Rubensian' or 'Rubenesque' (sometimes 'Rubensesque'). His large-scale cycle representing Marie de Medicis focuses on several classic female archetypes like the virgin, consort, wife, widow, and diplomatic regent. The inclusion of this iconography in his female portraits, along with his art depicting noblewomen of the day, serve to elevate his female portrait sitters to the status and importance of his male portrait sitters.Rubens's depiction of males is equally stylized, replete with meaning, and quite the opposite of his female subjects. His male nudes represent highly athletic and large mythical or biblical men. Unlike his female nudes, most of his male nudes are depicted partially nude, with sashes, armour, or shadows shielding them from being completely unclothed. These men are twisting, reaching, bending, and grasping: all of which portrays his male subjects engaged in a great deal of physical, sometimes aggressive, action. The concepts Rubens artistically represents illustrate the male as powerful, capable, forceful and compelling. The allegorical and symbolic subjects he painted reference the classic masculine tropes of athleticism, high achievement, valour in war, and civil authority. Male archetypes readily found in Rubens's paintings include the hero, husband, father, civic leader, king, and the battle weary.\nRubens was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci's work. Using an engraving done 50 years after Leonardo started his project on the Battle of Anghiari, Rubens did a masterly drawing of the Battle which is now in the Louvre in Paris. \"The idea that an ancient copy of a lost artwork can be as important as the original is familiar to scholars,\" says Salvatore Settis, archaeologist and art historian.\n\n\n=== Workshop ===\nPaintings from Rubens's workshop can be divided into three categories: those he painted by himself, those he painted in part (mainly hands and faces), and copies supervised from his drawings or oil sketches. He had, as was usual at the time, a large workshop with many apprentices and students. It has not always been possible to identify who were Rubens' pupils and assistants since as a court painter Rubens was not required to register his pupils with the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke.  About 20 pupils or assistants of Rubens have been identified, with various levels of evidence to include them as such. It is also not clear from surviving records whether a particular person was a pupil or assistant in Rubens' workshop or was an artist who was an independent master collaborating on specific works with Rubens. The unknowm Jacob Moerman was registerd as his pupil while Willem Panneels and Justus van Egmont were registered in the Guild's records as Rubens' assistants.  Anthony van Dyck worked in Rubens' workshop after training with Hendrick van Balen in Antwerp.  Other artists linked to the Rubens' workshop as pupils, assistants or collaborators are Abraham van Diepenbeeck, Lucas Faydherbe, Lucas Franchoys the Younger, Nicolaas van der Horst, Frans Luycx, Peter van Mol, Deodat del Monte, Cornelis Schut, Erasmus Quellinus the Younger, Pieter Soutman, David Teniers the Elder, Frans Wouters, Jan Thomas van Ieperen, Theodoor van Thulden and Victor Wolfvoet (II).He also often sub-contracted elements such as animals, landscapes or still-lifes in large compositions to specialists such as animal painters Frans Snyders and Paul de Vos, or other artists such as Jacob Jordaens. One of his most frequent collaborators was Jan Brueghel the Younger.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nAt a Sotheby's auction on 10 July 2002, Rubens's painting Massacre of the Innocents, rediscovered not long before, sold for \u00a349.5 million (US$76.2 million) to Lord Thomson. At the end of 2013 this remained the record auction price for an Old Master painting. At a Christie's auction in 2012, Portrait of a Commander sold for \u00a39.1 million (US$13.5 million) despite a dispute over the authenticity so that Sotheby's refused to auction it as a Rubens.\n\n\n== Selected exhibitions ==\n1936 Rubens and His Times, Paris.\n1997 The Century of Rubens in French Collections, Paris.\n2004 Rubens, Palais de Beaux-Arts, Lille.\n2005 Peter Paul Rubens: The Drawings, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n2015 Rubens and His Legacy, The Royal Academy, London.\n2017 Rubens: The Power of Transformation, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.\n2019 Early Rubens, Art Gallery of Ontario Toronto, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.\n\n\n== Lost works ==\nLost works by Rubens include:\n\nThe Crucifixion, painted for the Church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Rome, was imported to England in 1811.

This painting that had been deemed lost for nearly 400 years was rediscovered in 2017 in Pollok House, Glasgow, Scotland. Conservation treatment carried out by Simon Rollo Gillespie helped to demonstrate that the work was not a later copy by a lesser artist but was the original by the hand of the master himself.\n\n\n== Works ==\nEarly paintings\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nHistorical portraits\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nLandscapes\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMythological\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nNude\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nHelena Fourment and related pictures\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Drawings ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMore works\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAuwers, Michael, Pieter Paul Rubens als diplomatiek debutant.

          "Many wonderful artworks - still lifes, Biblical scenes, Marian themes - by artists from around Antwerp. A printed guidebook is available to explain some of the intricacies of many of the works. Select works have interactive multimedia \u2026",
          "It's a very luxury vila where Rubens used to live, and under the careful protection it keeps new and clean and well-organized. The exhibition is also amazing and fantastic, main collections of artist are presented.",

          "Nice museum. Art is well presented. All well kept.",
          "Must see if you're a fan of Rubens. A nice selection of his paintings including his preliminary oil sketches. Nice garden and portico as well.",
          "Very nice visit, well explained with the audioguide",
          "See the authentic atmosphere of Rubens' time and learn about his life. There are paintings of other artists, too. No air conditioning in the old premises, only in the new part. Was very hot at 35\u00b0 outside. Beautiful garden. 10 euros entrance fee.",
          "Never been into art and musea but this is really worth it !! \nCan't wait to visit again !!",
          "Had a good time visiting this local historic attraction. It's one of 10 things to do while in Antwerp and I enjoyed the spot.",
          "It is a good museum to know more about the circle of the painter, but I would like to see more pictures of the author. \nI liked the description of the different paintings. \nSpecially some of them that you can see in the photos.\nWhat I most liked it was the garden and the frontage of the Rubens' house.",
          "Very interesting in itself and good to learn about Rubens but the descriptions are lacking, even more so for someone not very knowledgeable in art",
          "Cheap and definitely worth it! Love to see and hear about Rubens.",
          "It's one of the \"must-see\" places in Antwerp. This is the house where Rubens lived and worked. There are a lot of his paintings and paintings of this peers and friends. Interior and the course itself are very beautiful. Backyard is extremely nice.",
          "Nice building. Only for Rubens or Art, in general, fans. Platin-Moretus and MAS - far more interesting expositions, than to take a look in RUBENS sleeping bed.",
          "I really really enjoyed this museum. It was \u20ac8 for adults over 26, and \u20ac6 if I remember correctly for under 26. There are handy booklets given out to each guest to read about the paintings which is great because it means people don't get bunched up to read signage. Beautiful ground. Took about 1-2 hours to get around",
          "Interesting space, you definitely can see a forward thinking mind conceived it.",
          "Nice place, amazing paintings, terrific garden in the back of the house, worths the visit!",
          "Went there early on a week day just as the house had opened, and had the privilege of seeing so many masterpieces in Ruben's actual house, with very few other visitors.  As we were leaving,  there were queues of people arriving, including many organised school trips.",
          "Great paintings and more:)  I absolutely love it",
          "On of the most beautiful baroque houses in Antwerp. The garden and his architecture alone is worth a visit. Great collection!",
          "An interesting collection of art that generally is connected to Reubens, created, owned or influenced. Nice free written guide to explain most of the display. Very much a directed tour rather than an aimless wander, security will politely \u2026",
          "Excellent place",
          "It's a highlight in Antwerpen, you can enjoy one of the most important places in the Art History. Portraits and paints by Rubens are magnific. Rates between 6 and 8 euros. The museum store is nice as well.",
          "Very interesting the Rubens house. Beautiful painting in to the owner' s private house outside with a garden. Look at it!",
          "Beautiful house with large collection of Flemish master pairings. Learn about Rubens and the painters that were influenced by him. Tickets cost \u20ac8 and the visit lasts about an hour",
          "Very interesting art pieces, artifacts and historic objects.",
          "I wanted to like it more. It\u2019s an ok place to visit. To get the pleasure of visiting Rubens's house is worth it if you\u2019re a fan. I\u2019m not sure that I would go out of my way to see it. But if you\u2019re in Antwerp and have nothing, to do why not.",
          "I loved every part of this - from the paintings to the architecture, to the decor, and the gardens.  Absolutely beautiful!",
          "Beautiful house. They are working on audio guide. So for now we just read from a booklet.",
          "Amazing museum, given the fact it was Rubens house. Has a nice selection of paintings from the masters of light. The unique thing about the house is it is like a mini palace, it has most of the elements but small, really well placed within \u2026",
          "Visiting Antwerp is a good and easy sight to visit. Recommended for art enthusiasts, you will see some nice piece of art with explanation guides for the correct price.",
          "For some reason Google will not let me insert an apostrophe in the title or remove the definite article, however, if you are in Antwerp a visit to the Artist's house is a rewarding and interesting experience. One should then continue to the \u2026",
          "Great little museum with a variety of high quality paintings - most not of Rubens himself - set in the historic context of the house that looks like time hasn't moved on since a few centuries. Recommended when in Antwerp and when you have \u2026",
          "I was flabergasted when I saw the state of this house... Superb decorations, Well preserved...Nice garden , Fun tour around the house.. when visiting Antwerp you shouldn't miss out on this museum",

          "Really excellent. A beautiful building, lovely gardens and a great art collection. Well worth a visit",
          "Superb basilica lovely structure inside and out",
          "What a lovely day at the Rubenshuis.\nWe went on the celebration of the finished restaurations, a big Italian garden feast.\n\nBecause of the feast, the museum was for free. Although with an A-card, for citizens of Antwerp you can always go \u2026",
          "Absolutely worthwhile visit. The regular adult tickets were 8\u20ac in 2019 (6 if you had a train ticket towards Antwerp) and free for children below 11yo.\nThe estate is packed with over 60 works from Rubens and his friends, collaborators, or \u2026",
          "Rich history. Lovely exhibitions",
          "I thought the statues outside in the garden were the most impressive thing I saw at the Rubens House. I would have liked to learn a bit more about Rubens, his daily life and his home in this museum. Most paintings here are not by Rubens \u2026",
          "Very nice",
          "I am not very much into arts but I enjoyed walking around the house and looking at the interior design of the house.",
          "The museum is very, very nice. It's worth the visit. The price for the tickets is very reasonable and the booklet guides are great. Don't miss the gardens: they are beautiful!",
          "An interesting historic place.",
          "Honestly a small place, not much too see.",
          "Nice museum, worth to visit since it shows the house where Rub\u00e9n lived, and some of his taste from other artists works",
          "Very interesting house of Reubens including his paintings",
          "Don't miss it. Its a great experince to see the house, his paintings and some of his colleagues.",
          "Some of the most beautiful paintings in exciting environment of place where Rubens had painted years. I have enjoyed especially the atelier with painting size of a truck. Must see in not only Antwerp but whole Belgium",

          "Really great explanation of all the art, and the path described in the info booklet makes sure you see and learn about the best art. If you're into Rubens and still life in general, I think it would be an amazing experience, but the 4 stars \u2026",
          "Very interesting museum with cool old atmosphere, as it was artist\u2019s living place.",
          "!!! Worth the price -everybody gets a little book with information. \ud83d\ude0d\nAnd those paintings",
          "I was there for the paintings and for the tour... I felt a bit claustrophobic...it had no ventilation and I felt dizzy... So 1 star taken away.Other than that... the real jems are his work...",
          "Quite a small museum, but packed with the paintings of Ruben and his assistants and contemporaries. In short you can take your time and see all the museum inside of 2 to 3 hours. Well worth a visit if you have the time and the interest in Ruben's.",
          "Huge booking office dominating the square although there were few visitors. House dark and not very clearly signed, some doors hard to open (not good for anyone with a disability?) plus many pictures weren't labelled. I did enjoy the digital shows of restoration etc.",

          "How wonderful to have a peek into an artist's house. The displays were amazing as well as the interior of the house. It was comparable to Rembrandt's house in Amsterdam. The gardens were tiny but it gave you a good example of the  type of \u2026",

          "Rubenshuis is the former house of the Flemish artist Rubens.\n\nThe Palazzo was designed by Rubens himself as both a place to live and a studio.\n\nIn 1937, the city of Antwerp acquired the house and turned it, after a nine year restoration, \u2026",
          "A must see when in Antwerp. Beautiful interior which shows at least an insight into the wealth Rubens had in his lifetime. Also intriguing to see how the well-to-do lived in that period. \n\n The art that is on expos\u00e9 has some unique pieces, \u2026",
          "Can see the real actual his paintings",
          "Amazing place to visit. Would recommend anyone to see it if travelling in Antwerp",
          "The house and the works of art are wonderful to see and the booklet describing the important items is very helpful, but it does not really show how or where the Rubens family lived.  I enjoyed going into the garden and seeing the house from \u2026",

          "This museum shows such valuable items belonging to this famous painter.\n\nThe museum is beautiful inside. On an unusually hot day, it probably is too hot but then it is a museum of one's house which makes it more authentic if stays as it \u2026",
          "Really incredible collection with absurd level of integrity from its age (1500-1600). Pedro Ruben was a genius and his art is all there available.",

          "Am excellent collection of beautiful paintings of Ruben's and his contemporaries.",
          "It was very educational visit to Rubens house, to see the premises where he worked and his collection of art, that inspired him for his work. Due to tight space, some areas were too crowded, and didn't allow proper time to study the work, \u2026",
          "Fun less busy museum that doesn't take hours to get through.",
          "Must see if you are interested in art.",

          "Absolutely marvelous painting done so many years ago. Fee little bit higher",
          "Renovations were ongoing, so only the house and garden were accessible, the 'atelier' was closed. Consequently, we didn't see a single Rubens painting... Try again when it's fully opened again",
          "Was more interesting than I imagined it to be, definitely worth the visit.",
          "Although the physical structure has been altered since Rubens day, the house still give a good feel for what kind of life the painter led. He was a prosperous middle class citizen who was a pillar of the local establishment. (As well as a truly great artist!!)",
          "The house that the artist lives for 30 years (although the setting had been altered). There is an English guidebook telling the stories of each painting which makes the experience more interesting.",

          "Be careful, it is open until 17:00 on Sundays!",
          "The private house where the master ones lived, not really a museum of his colossal works but nice for a quick stop. This summer (2018) some of his works can be seen at the cathedral, only 10 minutes away",
          "Visited right before the festival so there were some renovations happening and newly restored works on display. Such a great place to visit. Very good information available in a variety of languages and the price is more than reasonable.",
          "A fantastic museum for lovers of art",
          "This is a very worthwhile visit if you are in Antwerp and looking for something to do. This is especially true if you appreciate art. The house is full of Rubens masterpieces as well as pieces from Rubens personal collection. The latter \u2026",
          "An interesting view of the painters life and his collections. Try to go early to avoid large groups.",
          "Definitely a must see while in Antwerp.  Hire a tour guide if you can, it will help with so much additional history regarding Rubens and his pupils.",
          "A great house to explore. I think the real museum is made by the beauty of the house and not by the works of the artist!",
          "Mildly interesting",
          "This place, while lovely, has awful timings. The website says they close at 5, yet they'll kick you out of the museum at 4:45. I got to the giftshop a different day, and they said they were closed at 4:30 despite the doors being open and \u2026",
          "Great mix of architecture and paintings, well worth a visit for some history and only takes about an hour to get through.",
          "An awe inspiring experience, totally worth the price of the ticket. You get to see paintings from Rubens and from his close contemporaries, in the beautiful context of Rubens' own house. The tour goes into each of his rooms, full of \u2026",
          "This place is a must-see in Antwerp. Check out the house where Rubens lived and look at the paintings all his friends made. The house is awesome and old and you get to open some of the old doors as you move about within it. We got a discount on our admission by showing our train ticket from that day.",
          "Nice and quiet the way a museum should be, and affordable.",
          "A truly lot of pieces of art and you can go back in time to see how people used to live hundreds of years ago, seeing the house but also the paintings",
          "Tiny house full of beautiful art and the friendliest staff!! I enjoyed walking through the displays even though I took a wrong turn and missed an entire room and had to double back looking like a fool. The English pamphlet was nicely \u2026",
          "Interesting place and a \"must\" to visit for Antwerp",
          "We visited here last weekend. We had free entrance because we live in Antwerp and had our \u2018A-kaart\u2019 with us.\nThe museum is located in the old atelier of Rubens which is a big house with a quite interesting architecture and worth a visit for \u2026",

          "Great place. Very crowded.",
          "Rubens' reconstructed home was well worth a visit \u2013 but fell quite short of the mark, as we received absolutely no guidance or found even any signage for the rather steep 12 Euro entrance fee. As an art history lover, Rubens House had been \u2026",
          "It is a small museum. The paintings are of course fantastic, but it is hard to find your way around as it there are closed, unmarked doors to go though. Information about the paintings is scarce even if you pick up the booklet with extra \u2026",
          "A very nice experience indeed. \u20ac10 to get in. Pick up the free booklet as it has an explanation to each of the paintings and items on display. No explanations are provided at the house.",
          "As a cultured Alabman i understand that the Paintens are good for stuff. My sister and wife Mary-ann enjoyed the foods and i liked that them french peoples of Belguim like Americans, they speak this weird dialect called Vlaams, sounds like a confederate accent after a heavy night of drinken. God bless America",
          "The audio guide here used to be great.  Now they have an app that has all the audio files, but crashes constantly and uses up all your phone\u2019s battery life. The house is is still beautiful, the artwork is incredible, and it\u2019s interesting to \u2026",

          "Beautiful historic sensation, wonderful paintings, a must see. Adding some painters materials in the great atelier would be even nicer.",
          "The entrance to this museum is little hard to find. It really is a house built in Rubens time. Everything is small and dark and woody. There are some pieces of nice art but the biggest interest is house itself.",
          "Visit the house of one's of Europe greatest painters : Rubens. Get back in time .. in his time, in his works and spirit. A must to visit in Antwerp",
          "Not sure about the ins and outs of the location, but worth a visit if it raining in Antwerp. Brilliant painter and a renaissance man. \u20ac8 to get through it. Was not that inspired to be honest, but not my thing. Very busy, even on the 2nd January. The chap had clout. Would",
          "It was very good to see Rubens paintings and paintings from his studio and contemparies in the house that he actually lived in. We came away understanding that Rubens was a very successful commercial artist and very much a man of influence.",
          "Note: The tickets are sold at the kiosk OUTSIDE of the house, standing at the street, with the lockers for your luggage provided. Visited a Rubenshuis one a half hour before the closing time, which turned out to be a perfect choice- not too many people around. And you need some",
          "More than just paintings, although there are lots of those. Nice garden (would be better in the summer I expect). Lots of detail about Reubens life and times.",
          "If you ever look in admiration at a Ruben painting, then this is a must-see stop. The building is in two styles. One part of the house was his home. Here you can get an insight of what it was to live back then. The other portion is his workshop with many of his paintings. The",
          "The famous painter Peter Paul Rubens purchased this house in 1610 and added a semi circular sculpture museum, a workshop, a portico and a garden pavilion according to an own design. He continued living and working here until his death in 1640. Visitors can discover the house",
          "Somewhat incongruously located just off the main shopping street, the Rubenshuis is a must-do when in Antwerp - even though there are only a handful of paintings by the man himself within the house. Nonetheless, there are many works by his contemporaries on display as well as",
          "Very interesting to visit this special place. Beautiful building, extensive artworks, lovely interiors. Much about Rubens.",
          "The Rubenshuis is an example of a very nice house of a very rich person, well worth a visit. However, the number of Rubens paintings is limited, most of those are elsewhere. Lots of other, nice art however.",
          "I was not impressed. It was crowded and hard to see anything. Perhaps if I went on a weekday in off season it would have been a better experience.",
          "Visited this museum on a rainy day and we were really surprised how nice the house is . Very well preserved and wortwhile visiting",
          "The man was just incredible. A must for everyone who enjoys perfection. A story of 10 tales. Architect, diplomat, poet, businessman... and oh, yes, he also had some time to make some paintings,..... And this is the place where it all happened. Just let you get closer to the",
          "If you like art (and also a painting that David Bowie owned), you will love walking through the house of one of the masters of the renaissance! Learn how Ruben taught his students to find their speciality (animals, shrubs and forestry, human expressions and details) and",
          "This is a lovely museum that showcases the paintings and sculptures of Rubens inside of his old home. There is a self-guided tour that is very informative. The museum isn't too large and can bee seen in 1.5-2 hours max. There is also a lovely garden that you should spend some",
          "I did the self-guided tour and thoroughly enjoyed myself. The paintings, artifacts, and history in this building are amazing. A few videos offered additional information on history and restoration. I sat and stared at some paintings at my leisure, as did others. This is a hidden",
          "The Rubens house is a museum where we can see more about the great Artist!! The cathedral is under renovation, from outside it looks beautiful and you can see is under renovation. After you enter it\u2019s like a museum everywhere you look it\u2019s just gorgeous!! I spend two hours just",
          "The Rubens House is a fascinating and very well presented introduction to Rubens as painter, sculptor, mentor, world traveller and philosopher.",
          "This important town house, now a major tourist attraction, was the home of Peter Paul Rubens and is full of artefacts and displays telling the story of this famous Flemish painter and his life. He in fact designed and built the right hand side of the building which has a very",
          "I cannot claim to be any sort of amateur of the art of Rubens, but I was in Antwerp and my hotel was nearby, so I decided to check out his house. He had a large collection himself, and so there is much to see and enjoy along with some of the artist\u00b4s own creations. The guide",
          "The house is beautiful and the paintings are fantastic as are the gardens, I wish I could live there.",
          "very nice building, properly restored and maintained. some nice works of art are also displayed, a mix of great architecture and interesting paintings and sculptures.",
          "Fabulous and not to be missed. Leave plenty of time for your visit as the re is much to see and the room are well documented in the guide",
          "If you are used to thinking of artists as impoverished and only posthumously famous, Ruben's house will come as a shock. He had a wide and wealthy clientele and, in his large work studio, which you get to visit he had teams of artists working on his commissions - he might do",
          "I'm not an art person and never heard of Ruben but it's a place to see when in Antwerpen and so we did but after going to Louvre in the later part of our trip and I saw his Medici painting I knew he was a great painter which made me glad to enter and see his house earlier.",
          "Highly recommend to anyone who pass nearby Antwerp to visit this museum. A small gem plenty of Ruben's artworks and the objects of those time. Was amazed visiting it.",
          "Personally I tend to avoid visiting \u201cthe house of (fill in name)\u201d. Often these places have only a remote connection to the artist mentioned, rarely a relevant collection and usually they\u2019re an attempt by locals to cash in on the name and fame of (fill in name). None of that",
          "Really enjoyed the range of paintings this house had displayed as well as the interesting layout and history of the house. The garden is an oasis in a crowded city centre. Apparently they are restructuring the museum, at the moment you get a paper file to read descriptions.",
          "I thought it was very interesting to see where Reubens lived and learn about the restoration of one of his self portraits. We used the Rick Steves guide to tour the house, but wished we had a more detailed guide, which many others had obtained. Not sure if there weren\u2019t any left",
          "This house was owned by Rubens and is gorgeous by itself. Inside the house is artwork both completed by Rubens but also collected by him during his lifetime.",
          "Interesting museum to visit if you interested in the arts and old architecture. On display it art from a wide range of painter's. The museum is very popular so it can get busy.",
          "I enjoyed the visit at rubenshouse a lot. It\u2019s interesting and you get that feeling for the living earlier. Recommend it only for adults, I think for children it\u2019s a bit boring.",
          "Small museum housing many great works by Dutch painters. Home dates back to early 1699s, under renovation but home is intact. Gardens are special as well. Take at least 2 hours.",
          "This interesting and well-maintained museum is filled with world-class art, including some by Rubens and his contemporaries. There are useful background notes on each of the major paintings and other art objects. The courtyard garden is beautiful and calm respite from the busy",
          "Worth a visit. This isn\u2019t a huge property or garden but it\u2019s in a city centre and is interesting and doesn\u2019t take long to walk around. And obviously lots of art to view. Probably value for money",
          "It is a beautiful collection of items belongs to Rubens and his family. You will find many painting includes self portraits and furnitures. There is a pretty garden where you can rest and souvenir shop outside of the building where you purchase your tickets. It is a worth visit",
          "We spent couple of lovely hours wandering at our own pace around one of Rubens homes, good combinations of his work, life , friends, and how people of the Gentry lived in that time",
          "If you like art, this museum is a great one. Minimal cost for a fun, inspiring experience. The grounds are nice for a rest, too.",
          "Although the museum has changed since Rubens lived here, you can still picture him working here. Rubens was one of the few artists who was successful during his lifetime and this beautiful house certainly illustrates this.",
          "Amazingly preserved house! It might not be like in Rubens' lifetime, because it was owned by someone else afterwards and altered, but the portico and the garden pavilion remain more or less intact. Yes, it does not contain ONLY his works of art, yes, it does not contain his",
          "The only thing of authenticity is that Ruben once stood here, and maybe the exterior of the building would seem familiar, but there was a canal in front of it when he owned the property.... but maybe he rented? Extensively renovated and nothing original.",
          "I have found myself to Antwerp for a day trip and i had already the place on my \"to visit\" agenda. My selection worth every minute of it. It was very interesting to feel the house vibes of the famous Ruben and try to imagine the moments he had lived in. Well preserved garden and",

          "Friendly assistance offered and a detailed explanation of the museum was given. Beautiful and worth the visit. Stunning paintings and architecture.",
          "This is one of the best museum/art galleries I have visited. The intimate nature of being in the Rubenhuis, his home, made it so special. I entered close to opening time, it was not crowded being May, and people are kept moving in one direction so it is easy to view the",
          "Purchase your tickets at a ticket and information booth across from the main house. The house is organized so that you follow a specific path that will eventually lead you into the gardens. Great artwork and history. Highly recommend it.",
          "This is not full of Rubens paintings otherwise I wouldn't have enjoyed it so much. There are a few, but also many from other artists. It is interesting to see how prominent families lived at the time as you tour the house. Well worth a visit.",
          "This property is itself a very interesting historical and architectural example of what the well-healed of Antwerp were living in back in Rubens day. The art work within the house is well worth the visit on its own. Allow 2 hours and enjoy.",
          "I never loved Rubens very much. I remembre I got four nice reproductions of his paintings thanks to the Soubry spaghetti points I collected to get an Art history collection when I was a child. So I never visited the Rubenshuis when in Antwerp. And because of the Rubens year in",

However, don\u2019t expect to see that many actual work of Rubens\u2019 as most pieces on display were made by others (mostly his students) but it\u2019s definitely worth a visit. The garden is also really pretty and",

          "I understand this house has mostly been rebuilt, but it was well done. It gives a good idea of how the upper classes lived during the Golden Age of Dutch painting. No artworks really stand out, but the rooms contain many examples of the work of Rubens and his contemporaries.",

          "Beautiful house enlarged to provide space for the prolific painter who was knighted twice and was known as Sir Peter Paul Rubens. The reasonable admission was paid in a modern glass enclosure across the way where lockers were available for everything but small purses. We toured",

          "The house consists of two perts - the old with living zone which Rubens had bought and new with studio which was built by him. The museum contents many interesting pictures (Rubens himself, Van Deyk, Titian, Tintoretto), sculptires and things of the century. The gardens planned",
          "A must when visiting Antwerp. The actual house where P.P. Rubens lived and worked. His studio is available to visit as are the living areas. The garden is an oasis in the centre of Antwerp. A must.",
          "For a modest sum access to this \u201crabbit warren\u201d also gave a useful leaflet with descriptions of the principal works. The self guided tour winds in, up and around this delightful property packed full of art and effects and exposes what was once the home of Rubens. A good value",
          "Rubens house is really central and a must see stop for anyone visiting Antwerp. You don\u2019t have to be into Art to appreciate the house and it\u2019s history. The house itself is beautiful full of relics from the past and Rubens art, along with other artists of the era that he liked to",
          "If you are in Antwerp you should pay a trip to Rubens house, it is where he lived and where his atelier was. Beautiful home made to his own particular taste.",
          "The layout and guide was helpful to take you through the collection which was a fine example of 17th century works. Really liked the quotes from Rubens himself which were timeless. Some very classy examples of the genre and the era",
          "This small historical house is crammed with beautiful things, unfortunately it is also crammed with people; it is hot and stuffy, the pictures are badly lit, terribly hung and lack accompanying information. So in spite of the marvelous art the overall experience is somewhat",
          "Rubens... paintings... sublime craftsmenship, details, colors. If you love art and would like to see some unique paintings, this is the place to be. Marvels, hidden gems (yes I'm talking size) ara awaiting in the house of Rubens. Well... part of his garden is still original",
          "While you'll probably be paying most of your attention to the art here, be sure to look at the setting. This was Rubens home. Notice the fireplaces, the kitchen hearth, the woodwork and furnishings. Few of the pieces of furniture were his, but there is a chair he had designed",
          "Liked the grand looking house and all the paintings. Did not realise we had to pick up a tour guide book ourselves so couldn't read about all the history behind it. Expected more furniture in the house. The garden is has the best views.",
          "Visited this attraction on a visit to Antwerp and quite frankly, if you haven\u2019t been before..... why not? \ud83d\ude02 Beautiful gardens, a gorgeous house and absolutely incredible paintings... there is also a church nearby (just along the street) that has many of Rubens paintings too.",
          "We decided to visit Rubens House at the end of the day in Antwerp. We arrived with about 40 minutes before closing noting that last admissions were at 430pm. No sooner had we ventured inside the museum, that we were literally ushered through the rooms. It was clear that the",
          "Ruben's house is similar in architecture to the building that houses the printing museum, Plantin-Moretus. and it is well worth a visit to see the house alone. But it also houses Ruben's workshop and many of his paintings, as well as art works he collected. You get a sense of",
          "A peek into an old master's home , restored and immaculately presented. Some of works are on display too.Worth a visit.",
          "Splendid historic home, with old furniture, though not Rubens' furniture. and more non-Rubens paintings than Rubens paintings. I had hoped to see more of his work. nice garden, but the house was under renovation when we were there, so not as enjoyable as it could have been.",
          "Visited during the museum night, so maybe the museum was more limited than usually. Tip, take a paper with you where they explain all the art work, rooms, etc. No one told this to us before hand and the flyers were not available throughout the place. All in all, a nice jump back",
          "Spent around 3 hours wandering around Rubens House, admiring the artwork and furniture finishing with a walk around the garden",
          "Quite interesting tour. Purchased by Rubens in 1610. Portico and garden still as was in seventeenth century. A lot of art from time. Some art by and owned by Rubens. Felt like we stepped back in time. I found most interesting Ruben's HENRY IV AT THE BATTLE OF IVRY, an unfinished",
          "Went there on the last Wednesday of the month, free entry. The place is amazing and needs an hour to visit. They even provide a booklet to understand what you're looking at.",
          ":Located in the heart of the shopping district, Rubens House was a very nice and interesting break. Some very nice works of art displayed, and the tour of the 16th century house is very good. Gardens are beautiful.",
          "Beautiful house. Lovely garden. Great painting collection of Rembrandt & contemporaries. Free entry every last Wednesday of the month.",
          "The house and grounds are stunning. Plenty of architecture, paintings, and antiques to enjoy. We didn't take a guided tour; it is not necessary. Highly recommended!",
          "Rubens was wealthy during his time and his house is evidence of it. It is being presently restored, but his paintings and belongings are on view. It was an intimate experience to go around and view his works including a rare but beautiful \"Self Portrait'",
          "The museum is improved through the years. Is was overwhelmed by the restoration of Rubens' Self Image. Oh My God, it is the main attraction now. You can feel the energy of the master in this world class painting. This summer - 2018 - they renovate the garden building, so you",
          "The house itself is not affected by the renovation work..only the garden. Good selection of art work and a very interesting place to visit. Entry price is ok as well",
          "The museum is not bad, the lightning there is perfect, we liked the courtyard, everything's cute. But the building is very small and the amount of exhibit objects is small.",
          "This is one museum not to be missed while in Antwerp. Full of masterpieces well explained in context and Rubens connections to other great artists. Visiting his house and seeing the luxurious style in which he lived was wonderful and having the time to reflect on his life in his",
          "This was an unexpected treat. I had been expecting an empty house with a few bits of furniture but was most surprised. You can collect a booklet from the ticket office which provides insight into a number of different paintings and objects in the house, as well as some",
          "This is the house where Rubens lived. That's sufficient reason to visit this place, and explains that it can be crowded at times. Everything else depends if you do care? And explains why some people look and read or listen audio guide, and some just browse from room to room.",
          "I\u2019m not a person who visits art galleries much or has a lot of knowledge about art but I loved this place. A beautiful building, lovely gardens and the paintings on display are something special. A booklet is given to you at reception that gives information on a lot of the",
          "This was a very interesting attraction. It was fairly crowded but I think that had a lot to do with being the last Wednesday of the month which is a free entry day. Well worth a visit.",
          "The museum has a renovation, but that don\u2019t effect a visit Good presentation in several rooms. The garden is worthwile to visit",
          "If you're an art lover, this is the perfect place to go. Not only are there beautiful works done by Rubens himself, but he also had an extensive collection of other artists' works. Wonderful place to visit.",
          "shame about the exterior building works but the Inside is what it is all about not a very large museum but well laid out and a pleasure to see these great works of art one more negative is that the tour groups take up all the space",
          "It\u2019s a medium size art exhibition dedicated to Rubens in the house he reportedly resided in. Very easy to reach just off Meier street and about 12 minutes\u2019 walk from central station. You get 2 Euro discounting you\u2019ve travelled into Antwerp by train that day of the visit to the",
          "A distinct step back in time to see how Rubens would have lived. Plenty of history here and also some Rubens art to view. Lovely garden to relax in too.",
          "Wife and I explored this former home of Rubens as part of our tour of the \"Low countries\" this Spring, 2018. With the City card we purchased, the museum admission was automatically covered. Well worth the visit, although quite frankly the largest Cathedral in Antwerp had more",
          "The house was being refurbished when I visited but it was still possible to see many of Rubens' paintings. including short-term loans. It also contains a self-portrait of Van Dyck recently identified. Not all furniture was on view and the garden arch was not visible. The",
          "Lovely old home off the main shopping street. It is full of Ruben's artwork along with other Flemish painters.",
          "Studio and garden are very impressive. Lot\u2019s to see, large art collection. I like the brochure they give you with information.",
          "If you visit Antwerpen you must see the Rubens House. Many beautiful works of art as well as the grounds.",
          "Seeing the impressive paintings of this Flemish master, one can but wonder about the man and the time he lived in, or the city he came from. A real entrepreneur, he traveled Europe for the sake of art, business and politics. Born and buried in Antwerp, Rubens is everywhere. By",
          "The house is the scenario where we can appreciate paintings in every room, well presented and it is a vast collection. Highly recommended.",
          "... which I know is necessary. Also, there was no audio tour, but the guide said a new one was being developed. There is an Antwerp app that you can download, but it only somewhat worked on my phone and did not work at all for my wife. Excellent museum that focuses on, but",
          "This is definitely worth a visit! We had a local guide taking us through the life of Rubens, while visiting his chambers and seeing some of his most exquisite works. I'm not sure if experience is the same without a guide, so would recommend to take one in advance.",
          "A nice place to visit with an authentic feeling. You can still see the old windows, the leather on the walls and some of the original furniture. What i disliked is that there are allot of art pieces that have little connection to Rubens but are displayed there anyway just to",
          "Nice setup, lovely paintings, a bit crowded and hot. Again, tour groups in the way filling up the room, not keeping a path clear for people who want to keep moving. (Please restrict the size of the group) There is some construction going on which has minimal impact on the",
          "We visited. Super house, wonderful paintings and history. As we exited an employee gave us 2 tickets for free beer or water in a pavilion outside the building. What a nice touch. There is a beautiful garden. A concert was occuring. A super visit.",
          "Collection of art from around the time of Rubens. Some nice pieces, and most importantly, one gets a sense of how artists of this specific period were working. Very enjoyable, and centrally placed in Antwerp.",
          "Worth the visit while in Antwerp - not all pictures on walls are by Rubens, but by his students and friends. Even the garden was artistic.",
          "This is a beautiful house to visit. It has been restored to its original state and is full of wonderful paintings, furniture and sculpture. This is a MUST to visit. I can't wait to go back.",
          "Well worth the visit. Most of the interior is reconstructed but in the style and period of Rubens's occupation. Several Rubens paintings within.",
          "Yes, well worth a visit, but obviously all his better works are elsewhere. Could do with a few more places to sit as you tramp round.",
          "I found this museum very interesting. It\u2019s not too big & was not crowded. Some lovely Breugals. Worth a visit.",
          "I like art, Flemish Baroque included. But Rubenshuis is far from being remarkable. First, the collection consists of works by others. There are a few Rubens', but in nearby Plantin-Moretus it felt like there are more portraits by the master. Second, the early 17th century",
          "We managed to get in with a small que. It is kind of mix between art museum and house museum. You will not see Rubens' best paintings, but some pretty nice. Only thing we did not like was darkness. But it is a pretty old house.",
          "Rubens' reconstructed home was well worth a visit \u2013 but fell quite short of the mark, as we received absolutely no guidance or found even any signage for the rather steep 12 Euro entrance fee. As an art history lover, Rubens House had been high on my list to see \u2013 and, having",
          "I got lucky to be on the last Wednesday of the month. But as I came around 15.45 h I didn't have enough time to really appreciate all the beautiful painting and pieces of art. The museum was closed and I had to almost run through the rooms. Going back to Antwerp I will go again",
          "I always had the idea that most famous painters lived lives of poverty devoted to their art but Ruben's house debunked that idea!! This is a beautiful mansion located in the city centre and is well worth a visit if visiting Antwerp. Admission for a family of 4 (2 adults and 2",
          "Visited with limited mobility issues! No help, advice, suitable places to rest, etc. Staff were NOT interested in helping. As I did not need a wheelchair there was nothing to do but sit in the doorman\u2019s chair and wait until my daughter and husband returned! Will I visit again -",
          "It is here that Rubens lived with his family and worked with his colleagues and assistants in his studio. He created many of his paintings in this house, in the center of Antwerp. The city bought the house in 1937 and after an extensive restoration the Rubens house was opened to",
          "Fantastic experience to walk through the house where one of the greatest painters ever lived and worked. The house and the garden are well worth a visit on its own and furthermore there are quite a number of important pictures, also of other painters.",
          "This is a great museum to visit and you don't need to much time to do it ca 1h ( some people for sure take more and some take less depending on interest but there is some amazing items and some amazing painting on display here, a must for the one interested in art and history",
          "It's a given that anyone who loves and appreciates Rubens, or the Flemish masters in general, must visit Rubenshuis when in Antwerp. It is full of his works along with works of other artists of his period that he collected, in addition to being just a beautiful home",
          "For any admirer of Flemish art, the Ruben's house should be one of your first visits. This is where Peter Paul Reuben's worked and lived during the 16th and 17th centuries. Many paintings from other painters of that era as well.",
          "This museum hosts paintings from Rubens and those artists that he admired and worked with. An interesting place to visit for a couple of hours.",
          "You basically just get a small paper guide in your hands and need to walk through the house. Per se that is a bit boring, but the art on show and the stories are good. There are works from other painters in the house. Also a Tintoretto, that used to belong to David Bowie for 30",
          "I visited Rubens House this month and I was impressed. If you\u2019re in Antwerp is a must to visit Rubenshuis. You\u2019ll not regret for sure.",
          "\u20ac8 entrance fee. I think there are only 12 pieces of Ruben inside although works by other artists too. You are given a pamphlet/guide and follow the numbers. I was a little disappointed on the whole.",
          "It was very interesting to see the house that Rubens and his family lived in. Most of the paintings featured are not by Rubens however were part of his art collection. It now even boasts a Tintoretto that used to belong to the private collection of David Bowie. The free guide",
          "This precious building is worth to visit. If you love paintings its a must to see it. You can spend one or two hours there and looking also at the beautiful garden. The location near the Meir with is pedestrian shopping area and also loved to visit",
          "A must-see in Antwerp. This is a wonderful historic-house museum, especially the garden in the back, which was the back-drop for several of Rubens' famous portraits (used for the same purpose by his famous pupil Anthony Van Dyck). Don't expect great paintings by Rubens though -",
          "The Rubenshuis is an ok museum, but has the feeling of not being so well maintained as other museums in Antwerp. This is likely due to the fact that it is easily the busiest. Save time and just visit the Plantijn-Moretus Museum, which is far more interesting, and the cathedral",
          "Came to Antwerp to visit this house but a notice on door informed me that strike action on 19th December would stop opening. Shame as it looks like such an interesting place. Headed off to Cathedral to view 4 Reuben's masterpieces there.",
          "Just like to sit in the garden ,with the snow it was beautiful serenity,in summer I like to eat my lunch there in the garden on a bench The museum is a must to see,you also can see the furniture from in the time from Rubens You can see his bed, that time the people was still",

          "Marvelous collection of paintings at Antwerp. We paid 8 Euros per person for entrance and they have lockers for us to put our bags. This is a massive collection of amazing painting by Rubens in his house. it takes more than 1 hour to enjoy the paintings. We thoroughly enjoyed",
          "I am not normally a big fan of art and know little about famous artist but I was totally fascinated by the works of Rubens. What a lovely house. I believe all I could keep saying was WOW! I highly recommend to anyone visiting Antwerp. You don't have to be an art lover to",
          "At the moment they are restoring various parts of the Museum, so for the full experience it might be an idea to wait until this is completed, (?some time next year?}. Even so there are so very good paintings to see there, so if it is your only chance of a visit and you are a",

          "A pearl of art. If yout in to art you can't pass the famousaintings of Peter Paul Rubens. The museum has a great variety of paintings and sketches of the master and his pupils and tells more about the mans life",
          "This is Ruben\u2019s home restored to be as he had it, but is now an art museum, and contains much beautiful artwork as well as an absorbable amount of historical detail. Easy to find, tickets are available in the cabin outside ... at \u20ac7 per person the costs are modest; visitors then",

          "I learned by visiting this house that Rubens was one of those rare painters who became wealthy in his life due to his success as a painter. The house is like a small palace with authentic furniture items, paintings, wallcoverings, sculptures and other unique items such as the",
          "Peter Paul Rubens ha a profound effect on Western art. In Antwerp his home is quite a shrine to his life. The curators have worked hard to match the original house to the requirements of displaying art from Rubens, his inspirations and contemporaries. It's quite a small museum",

          "We lucked into a free visit just by being here on the correct day: the final Wednesday of the month, when admission fees are waved. Even if we had paid, the visit is well worth the cost. Besides the impressive house and art within, there is a beautiful garden in the courtyard",
          "Although I'm not a particular fan of Rubens, I completely enjoyed my trip to his beautiful home for three (3) reasons. First, his collection of art interested me more than his own work. Second, I learned a bit about how (upscale) people lived at that time - from the short bed",
          "Visit this museum if you are very interested in Rubens. A good insight of the artist and his life and times. Nice garden too.",
          "It was great to be in Rubens' family home. Great range of seventeenth century paintings and other artefacts. There is some building work going on so the garden isn't to quiet . My second visit to the Rubenshuis and will return again in my next visit to Antwerp.",

          "This is of course a must see when you are in Antwerp. A beautiful and impressive building showing the wealth of the famous painter Peter Paul Rubens who was born in Siegen, Germany in 1577. Rubens catered for the rich and famous of his time and part of their wealth spilled over",
          "I thought I was going to learn about the man himself and see his art. In fact I learned and saw little. It was a nice house though, most of it reproduction (like the ornate wallpaper) but still impressive to see. It was worth the visit, maybe I just had my hopes up. Oh and the",
          "Wow what a house! The building itself and the gardens already are spectacular, and so was the inside! Unfortunately, they don't actually have much art by Rubens himself (which they explain in their folder), but they do make up for this with other beautiful paintings and",
          "Wonderful collection of Rubens' work in a well maintained setting. A little confusing to navigate from area to area. Not much explanation of the man himself, but still very worthwhile",
          "This old house was the home of Rubens, and he did well in his time if you look around the house and garden. The ineterior itself is worth a visit, but you come here for Rubens right? Well there is a lot of of art, but not that much of Rubens, you will see a lot paintings of his",
          "This house is well worth a visit. It was Ruben's home. Some wonderful paintings and a beautiful garden.",

          "Absolutely worth the visit, mainly for the contents, but also for the building in itself. An absolute insight into the history and evolution of art at the end of the 16th century and into the 17th. Though I felt I learned more about van Dyck and Vermeer than Reubens that took",

          "The Rubens' House is worth a visit if you have a spare hour or two in Antwerp. While not much of the building dates back to Rubens' time, it's architectural features and the paintings, mostly by Rubens' contemporaries, are of interest. They no longer offer the audio guide,",

          "I'm glad we came here. I wish there had been more information about the home itself and it's architecture, but I know it's the paintings themselves which draw so many crowds. We easily spent a couple of hours here. I didn't know the home covered such a large area, and the",

          "The Rubens House was a very rewarding experience. The art of Rubens is both immense and breathtaking. You really appreciate the genius of Rubens by gazing at his beautiful masterpieces. Also, the house also has a lovely garden. Well worth the visit if you have any appreciation",

          "Rubenshuis as the name suggests is the actual house Peter Rubens liked in during his life. As if it wasn't enough just to visit the house of this great Flemish master, the museum contains many works of art by Rubens himself, plus works by other Flemish masters such as Van Dyck.",

          "I went there with my daughters (11 and 3), the ticket was 8 euros, both girls were free which was great. It is a short walk from a central train station, about 15 minutes, not too far at all. We all were impressed by the house, lots of little details,the painter was clearly",

          "After a few disappointments with artist's houses elsewhere, which were mostly modern recreations or clumsily assembled models, this was a gem. Atmosphere is somewhat gloomy, you will feel immersed in the past. Most paintings are not by Rubens, but selection is clever and tells a",
          "Nice little house of Paul Ruben now converted to museum. It's cramped inside so you have to have patience and this is definitely how handicap accessible but it is his original home. Lots of stairs too. The art is lovely though. Worth the walk through.",

          "A must see in Antwerp is Rubenshuis. It's easy to find, just off the main shopping precinct, and you can wander at leisure through the house, gallery and gardens. As a retired art teacher I found it fascinating to have an intimate view of the life of Rubens, but the appeal is",

          "Not exactly a great attraction, but plenty of very worthwhile art to view. Unfortunately, both times I visited were pretty crowded and the constant chatter of tour guides (in various languages) was very annoying. If you can get here during a quiet time, I could recommend it.",
          "My overall impression was good. My biggest criticism were the bored docents sitting in rooms. These people were a glum lot. They fiddled with their phones and looked totally miserable. No smiles or any personality whatsoever. Only one was helpful and friendly. Wax",

          "Well, another city, another famous artist's house that has been recreated to look like it did when the artist actually lived there. Still, it is certainly worth visiting if you happen to like paintings, in particular those of Rubens (though he lived somewhat earlier than the",
          "We visited this iconic building during the night of the museum in Antwerp. It is a gorgeous building with so much breathtaking artwork. This place is a must see when visiting Antwerp!",
          "We have been to a lot of museums on this trip but this one stood out because of the venue. The guide are really helpful in navigating all the different works of art.",

          "Beautiful museum, i advice it to all people who wants to deep Ruben'life and work. The only problem has been the staff: everywhere is written that the museum close at 17 and nobody told me otherwise. I arrived at 15,50 so i thought i had all the time. When i had to visit the",
          "One of several places that celebrate Rubens, this museum is quite extensive and well curated. Best to see it as part of the whole Rubens experience in Antwerp and to take in other museums and some of the churches in the same visit.",
          "One of the biggest painters in the world and in Belgium is Pieter Paul Rubens. He was a 17 century flemish baroque painter, drawer and diplomat and worked in Antwerp. The house where he worked and lived in you can visit and it's almost the same as he left it when he died in",
          "Very interesting museum gives a good insight in the life and time of this artist. Quite huge town-house for those days. Typical Rubensian paintings are not in abundance.",
          "Come here several times a years and if you have about an hour (or a bit less) time it's really worthwile. You get a good impression of the living quarters of Rubens but also a very nice collection of artworks related to him and you end in his working hall and the very nice",
          "Amazing paintings of Rubens in the beautiful House of Rubens himself. Located in the peaceful city centre of Antwerp. Worth a visit for many foreigners.",
          "This museum is a must for visitors to Antwerp. From the gilt leather walls to the four poster bed, this place was captivating. So opulent!",
          "Here one can witness how it was, the life of a master painter. How he lived, worked and some of his works are displayed and afterwards it is also interesting to visit the Cathedral, just a few steps away",
          "A trip through Antwerp`s rich history as embodied by its most famous painter/diplomat/art collector. Good information, slightly outdated displays, but they add to the charm.",
          "In the city centre of Antwerp, this impressive palazzo that Rubens called home was designed by the master himself. He lived and worked in it. Next to an interesting collection It also shows you how he lived and worked.",
          "If you dream to see how the maestro lived, the intimacy of his daily life, his atelier that produced masterpieces that can be found all over the city, you have to visit his house. Even for today standards its marvelously constructed, light flows in naturally and in summer you",

          "The Rubens House is a great museum to visit when in Antwerp. The rooms inside the museum are small because they are authentic to when Rubens lived there. The museums hosts numerous works by the master and added some other interesting pieces. Visiting this museum is like",
          "For anyone who heard about Ruben, this place is a must. Rubens built this magnificent house at the age of 33, just one year after his marriage with Isabella Brant! Very interesting fusion of local and Italian renaissance-type buildings.",

          "Even not being an art lover...I enjoyed walking through the house, studio, and garden of this famous Flemish artist. I learned a lot and that is why I take the time to tour places like this!",
          "This place had a lot of really nice artwork in a historic house, and it is one of the main attractions in Antwerp. Construction/renovation limited my enjoyment. For comparison, I enjoyed Rembrandt's house in Amsterdam much more than the Rubens house, but I'm not much on art.",
          "I had looked forward eagerly to seeing the Rubenshuis and am glad that I got to see it. The house has many beautiful and interesting features and deserves its popularity . Unfortunately, that very popularity detracts from the atmosphere. Another minor gripe is that the English",
          "This is one of Antwerp's most famous attractions and its no wonder. The staff at the ticket office are probably some of the most courteous we have ever come across and once inside the house, you cannot help but marvel at the paintings on display. 30-60 mins is all you need but",
          "Lovely old house full of interesting art and sculpture.Also nice gardens. There was a caf\u00e9 as well. In a nice position in town.",

          "The beautiful house of the famous painter Rubens. You will find the original furniture along with painting from his private collection.",
          "I felt that this museum could have made more of the architecture and furniture of the house. Signage could be improved.",

          "We began our visit by enjoying the well planted garden and then progressed to the very impressive house. We had read other reviews and followed the suggestion of the audio guide for an extra \u20ac2 per person and it was a very good investment. The audio points are well marked and",
          "While not being very enthusiastic about painting, I really enjoyed my 2-hour visit here. For 2 euros the audio guide is a useful extra, as it gives you a lot of interesting facts about the paintings you see. Naturally I didn't like all the art work in the house, but some of it",
          "Very interesting house, of two distinct halves. Enjoyed looking at the artwork but also seeing how small some of the rooms were. Beatiful garden. Everything is well maintained, which is a credit to the City,",
          "Did not expect much, but was pleasantly surprised at the house, contents and art (not just his!) in the house. Well worth a trip. But you should remember to get a combo ticket for this house and the museum Mayer Ben de Burg. A few blocks away and worth it as well",
          "Although the furniture is not original, the house represents how people lived in the golden ages of Antwerp. On top of that, you can enjoy several fantastic paintings of Rubens and his students. Certainly a highlight for people who look for culture.",
          "It is a 'must' to see for history and art lovers. If you want to avoid crowds early start on working day is recommended. The audio and booklet are good source of information. All bags need to be stored in lockers which are free of charge. The only negative point is that one",

          "I expected some more nice historical evidences in this house. Especially if you compare it with the price one pays for it. The only interesting corner were the paintings.",
          "We loved our time spent at the Rubenshuis. The audio guide was extremely helpful and gave us details we never could have learned on our own. You will be asked to store your bags, large purses etc. in the storage locker in the cashier's office which was free to do. The house is",

          "If you like art and pittoresque places this is the museum for you. It is well preserved and catapults you back in time, the time of Rubens. I used to come here all the time just to wander through the corridors and take it all in.",
          "A very well preserved interesting historical site in the middle of the Meir Street (one of Antwerp's main shopping areas).",
          "Must see when visiting Antwerp. This tour will take about an hour. Located next to main shopping street.",
          "It was a cute little museum but we didn't bring out passport so we were allow to get the audio set. Would of been nice to at least pays deposits. It's near the Meir and very easy to find",
          "If you have the chance, wait a bit with your visit. Garden and parts of the building are currently under construction (May 2016). You can still see the whole interior, which is amazing, but the scaffolding distracts a bit when you relax in the garden",
          "Ruben's House is a wonderful and charming museum. It is not too large but has many wonderful portraits and paintings to enjoy. It should be on your to do list for Antwerp",
          "Some art work but mostly very well preserved original house provides a different insight on Rubens's life",
          "I really enjoyed my visit here. It has a lovely collection of artworks by Rubens and others and one is likely to find an artistic gem that connects with you. It is relatively inexpensive with a free small guide book as well as an other slightly bigger guide book for only \u20ac2",
          "This place just breathes history. You'll expect to see the master himself in the next room. One of my favourite museums in Belgium!",
          "He is one of the most influential person in Antwerp. If you like to learn about history and Baroque, this is a place to come. Noted it is close on Monday",
          "We spent several hours here exploring his beautiful home in the city of Antwerp which dispelled the notion that all artists died poor and wretched",
          "Excellent museum, wonderful surroundings in the heart of Antwerp a fantastic place to escape the hustle and bustle of this amazing city.",
          "Situated just off the main street and with a separate ticket office we used our Eurostar ticket for a 2-4-1 deal. (If we'd visited on a Sunday it would have been free - a saving of a further 6 euros.) The house seems vast with many small rooms to see, and a garden to stroll in",
          "This is a beautiful house, palazzo, in the center of Antwerp with a special atmosphere, not only because it was the house of Rubens. Enjoy also the garden.",
          "A visit to Rubens House is an enriching experience. That's true that it's a long visit, you must put perhaps two hours to wholly catch all the highly valuable information associated to all those marvelous paintings. There are also all that beautiful furniture. You can borrow a",
          "Visited Antwerp for the first time in 1978 so enjoyed visiting Rubens House. The paintings and the architecture and his studio, refreshed memories from long ago.",
          "Rubens House took a bit od finding but now we know to turn right a the fountain! The is a very popular attraction and well worth a visit, try to avoid following an orgaised group as the rooms are small and it is better to get a chance to appreciate the setting and taking in the",
          "It's small, unassuming, and a little difficult to find, but oh, is it worth the trip. For 6/8 euros, this is a manageable home of the master. It's full of PPR's masterpieces as well as some of those of his students-van Dyke in particular. The little guide, in 4 idioms, is all",
          "We spent about 1 1/2 hours here using our audio guides which were really helpful in understanding the story behind the House of Rubens. In early April the gardens were not yet flourishing but the layout of the house and grounds were impressive. Recommended.",
          "It goes without saying that Rubens was an excellent artist but the house stands proof that, unlike many famous artists whose talent was only recognised once they were dead, Rubens was certainly rewarded well in life. The house is beautifully designed, well-maintained and after",
          "Just to admire the paintings and reminders of the life and times of Rubens. Do take the audio guide and understand how people copied his paintings. Also fascinating to see how his students would paint and he would finish the paintings as his own.",
          "I've been enchanted by this house for as long as I can remember. Having lived in Antwerp I would visit every so often and each time I felt blown away by how well this house, it's furniture and the numerous paintings on display are being preserved for future generations to",
          "We saw this on the top 10 list of things to do in Antwerp, so we decided we must go and visit Rubens House. Antwerp is very easy to navigate if you have a map which our hotel handed out for free. It costed under \u20ac10 pp to visit the house and it was worth it! We were given a",
          ".. as it was in Rubens's day and also into his career and the politics of the time. We got a joint ticket with the Mayer van den Burgh costing 10 Euros (whereas each of these cost 8 Euros each) so a good deal. FWIW: we found the Mayer museum to be excellent.",

          "As a guide in the Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam I realy had to go to The Rubens House. I prepaired myself and knew what i expected, but still it is fasinating to walk around in a house of such a great and succesfull painter of the 17th century!",

          "This was an inexpensive, relatively short (90-minute) trip that included some really interesting architecture and art. Beautiful art, really. If you're interested in exploring a 17th-century house, however, you'll be disappointed. I only realised when I got there that the entire",
          "We went on a Sunday thinking there would b less crowd but to our surprise it was packed. The tickets per person is 10 euro however since we had gone by train from eindhoven they charged us 12 euro for both of us. They give you a small booklet with details on d artist which was",
          "This place was one of our Antwerp's highlights without any doubt. Unusual but very interesting museum... It is actually the palace house where P.P Rubens lived for more than 25 years. Very beautiful house and interesting exhibition - truly recommended!",
          "We visited on the free museum day of the month so crowds were to be expected but this place was so incredibly crowded with tourists that it was hard to find enough space to appreciate the pieces of art hanging up. An interesting place to see but we certainly should have timed",
          "I went specifically to Antwerp to see Reuben house. Although they give you a guide it does not cover everything and your oblivious as to whether the furniture was his or where it came from. They tell you little about him. I would like to know how he became so prominent, about",
          "I was undecided about visiting but SO glad I did. Such an amazing building. Lots of history within the building and the paintings. Lots to see and all amazing. There are beautiful gardens to visit too.",
          "First of all, I am not an art critic or have any deep art knowledge. From my POV, going to Rubens house was an amazing experience! I like baroque paintings and Rubens' paintings stole my heart away. Not only that, they also displayed some furnitures that he used. I was really",
          "Much bigger than expected with magnificent paintings. The rooms are also interesting in themselves. Very good free guide book with entry",

        "wiki": "Antwerp ( (listen); Dutch: Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen); French: Anvers [\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281s] (listen)) is a city in Belgium and the capital of Antwerp province in the Flemish Region. With a population of 520,504, it is the most populous city proper in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people, it is the second largest metropolitan region after Brussels.Antwerp is on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe and within the top 20 globally. The city is also known for its diamond industry and trade.\nBoth economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt. Antwerp was also the place of the world's oldest stock exchange building, originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872.The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren (Dutch pronunciation: [s\u026a\u0272\u02c8jo\u02d0r\u0259(n)]), after the Spanish honorific se\u00f1or or French seigneur, \"lord\", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century. The city hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is New Latin.A Germanic (Frankish or Frisian) origin could contain prefix anda (\u201cagainst\u201d) and a noun derived from the verb werpen (\u201cto throw\u201d) and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit; a mound (like a terp) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf. If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean \"those who live on both banks\".There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river. He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt.\n\n\n=== Pre-1500 ===\nHistorical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952\u20131961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. The earliest mention of Antwerp dates from the 4th century.\nIn the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks.The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II, a border province facing the County of Flanders.\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon,  was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nAfter the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant, grew in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly enslaved Africans as the century progressed. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544\u20131574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became \"the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height.\" Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the \"Age of Exploration\". During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps.  Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas\".\n\nWithout a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venetian Republic, Republic of Ragusa, Spain and Portugal.  Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \"To the merchants of all nations.\" Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers.  In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth.  Numerous financial bankruptcies  began around 1557. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nThe religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries. The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury: 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over \u00a32 million sterling of damage was done.\n\n\n=== Dutch revolt ===\nSubsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa, and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock) and an access- lock and mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.\n\nIn 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chass\u00e9. For a time Chass\u00e9 subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass\u00e9 made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi)  from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAntwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During World War I, the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Li\u00e8ge. The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.\nAntwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. \nDuring World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote, V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic) Orthodox Judaism.\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into nine entities (districts):\n\nAntwerp\nBerchem\nBerendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo\nBorgerhout\nDeurne\nEkeren\nHoboken\nMerksem\nWilrijkIn 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp, the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.\n\n\n== Buildings and landmarks ==\n\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was noted for the wealth of its citizens (\"Antwerpia nummis\"). The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the Hanseatic League on the northern quays, in 1891. During World War II, the city also suffered considerable damage from V-bombs, and in recent years, other noteworthy buildings have been demolished for new developments.\n\nAntwerp Zoo opened in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the world.\nAntwerp City Hall dates from 1565, and is built primarily in Renaissance style.\nAntwerp Central Station is a railway station designed by Louis Delacenserie which was completed in 1905.\nCathedral of Our Lady. This church was begun in the 14th century and finished in 1518. The church has four works by Rubens, viz. \"The Descent from the Cross\", \"The Elevation of the Cross\", \"The Resurrection of Christ\" and \"The Assumption\"\nSt. James' Church, is more ornate than the cathedral. It contains the remains of numerous famous nobles, among them a major part of the family of Rubens.\nThe Church of St. Paul has a baroque interior. It is a few hundred yards north of the Grote Markt\nSt. Andrew's Church\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church\nMuseum Vleeshuis (Butchers' Hall) is a fine Gothic brick-built building, situated a short distance to the North-West of the Grote Markt.\nPlantin-Moretus Museum preserves the house of the printer Christoffel Plantijn and his successor Jan Moretus\nThe Saint-Boniface Church is an Anglican church and headseat of the archdeanery North-West Europe.\nBoerentoren (Farmers' Tower) or KBC Tower, a 26-storey building built in 1932, is the oldest skyscraper in Europe. It is the tallest building in Antwerp and the second tallest structure after the Cathedral of our Lady. The building was designed by Emiel van Averbeke, R. Van Hoenacker and Jos Smolderen.\nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts\nMuseum Mayer van den Bergh, with works from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nRubenshuis is the former home and studio of Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) in Antwerp. It is now a museum.\nRockox House is the former 17th-century Residence of Nicolaas II Rockox, lord Mayor of Antwerp.\nBourse of Antwerp. Originally built 1531; extensively restored 1872; now Antwerp Trade Fair.\nPalace of Justice, designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006. This building is the antithesis of the heavy, dark court building, designed by Joseph Poelaert, which dominates the skyline of Brussels. The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built on the site of the old Zuid (\"South\") station, at the end of a magnificent 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12). The building's highest 'sail' is 51 m (167 ft) high, has a floor area of 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft), and cost \u20ac130 million.\nZurenborg, a late-19th-century Belle \u00c9poque neighbourhood, on the border of Antwerp and Berchem, with many Art Nouveau architectural elements. The area counts as one of the most original Belle \u00c9poque urban expansion areas in Europe.\nMuseum aan de Stroom\nDen Botaniek or Antwerp's Botanical Garden, created in 1825. Located in the city centre, at the Leopoldstraat, it covers an area of almost 1 hectare.\nHarmonium Art museuM, a museum on pump organs in Klein-Willebroek\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (M HKA)\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\n\nAlthough Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former enceinte, only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. A replica of a castle named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais in the 19th century.\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:\n\n10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch\n12th and 13th century: canals (so called \"vlieten\" and \"ruien\") were made\n16th century: Spanish fortifications\n19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications\n20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\nThis is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.\n\n\n=== Minorities ===\nIn 2010, 36% to 39% of the inhabitants of Antwerp had a migrant background. A study projects that in 2020, 55% of the population will be of migrant background.\n\n\n==== Jewish community ====\n\nAfter The Holocaust and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic, live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff  (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk, based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Ger, Skver, Klausenburg, Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\n==== Jain community ====\n\nThe Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business. Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds. A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk).  Mr Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a full-fledged member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nThere are significant Armenian communities that reside in Antwerp, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with a smaller numbers are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church.\nOne of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel and involved in is the diamond trade business, that based primarily in the diamond district. Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nAccording to the American Association of Port Authorities, the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014\u20132020.  The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.\n\n\n=== Diamonds ===\nAntwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion. The city has four diamond bourses: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers. Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian and Maronite Christian from Lebanon and Armenian, traders become increasingly important.Antwerp World Diamond Centre, (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry. However, in recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nA six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to Brussels, Hasselt and Li\u00e8ge, Ghent, Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"Oosterweelconnection\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to Amsterdam and Paris, and national trains to Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Brussels, Charleroi, Hasselt, Li\u00e8ge, Leuven and Turnhout.\nAntwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald's haunting novel Austerlitz. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"premetro\" and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nA small airport, Antwerp International Airport, is located in the district of Deurne, with passenger service to various European destinations. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre.\nThe now defunct VLM Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport. This office is also CityJet's Antwerp office. When VG Airlines (Delsey Airlines) existed, its head office was located in the district of Merksem.Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport, is about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.\nThere is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs twice every hour on working days.\nThe runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.\nIn September 2019 Air Antwerp began operations with their first route to London City Airport with old VLM Airlines Fokker 50's.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections.\nThe current majority consists of N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld, led by mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA).\n\n\n=== Former mayors ===\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century important mayors include Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Nicolaas II Rockox.\nIn the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti\u00e8ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (New Flemish Alliance).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntwerp has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) similar to that of Southern England, while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) average highs for both July and August. Winters are more dominated by the maritime currents instead, with temps being heavily moderated.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAntwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its school of painting, which included Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the Teniers and many others.\n\nInformally, most Antverpians (in Dutch Antwerpenaren, people from Antwerp) speak Antverpian daily (in Dutch Antwerps), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other Brabantic dialects for its characteristic pronunciation of vowels: an 'aw' sound approximately like that in 'bore' is used for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the 'a' in 'hat'. The Echt Antwaarps Teater (\"Authentic Antverpian Theatre\") brings the dialect on stage.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nAntwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in the world. It has served as the learning centre for many Belgian fashion designers. Since the 1980s, several graduates of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts have become internationally successful fashion designers in Antwerp. The city has had a huge influence on other Belgian fashion designers such as Raf Simons, Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Theyskens and Kris Van Assche.\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nAntwerp is famous for its local products. In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally \"Antwerp Hands\". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.\n\n\n=== Missions to seafarers ===\nA number of Christian missions to seafarers are based in Antwerp, notably on the Itali\u00eblei. These include the Mission to Seafarers, British & International Sailors' Society, the Finnish Seamen's Mission, the Norwegian Sj\u00f8mannskirken and the Apostleship of the Sea. They provide cafeterias, cultural and social activities as well as religious services.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAntwerp is the home of the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC), founded in 1938 and located on the square Grote Markt since 1994.The band dEUS was formed in 1991 in Antwerp. dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material. Their musical influences range from folk and punk to jazz and progressive rock.\n\n\n=== Music festivals ===\nCultuurmarkt van Vlaanderen is a musical festival and a touristic attraction that takes place annually on the final Sunday of August in the city center of Antwerp. Where international and local musicians and actors, present their stage and street performances.Linkerwoofer is a pop-rock music festival located at the left bank of the Scheldt. This music festival starts in August and mostly local Belgian musicians play and perform in this event.Other popular festivals Fire Is Gold, and focuses more on urban music, and Summerfestival.\n\n\n=== World Choir Games ===\nThe city of Antwerp will co-host the 2020 World Choir Games together with the city of Ghent. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAntwerp held the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were the first games after the First World War and also the only ones to be held in Belgium. The road cycling events took place in the streets of the city.Royal Antwerp F.C., currently playing in the Belgian First Division, were founded in 1880 and is known as 'The Great Old' for being the first club registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1895. Since 1998, the club has taken Manchester United players on loan in an official partnership. Another club in the city was Beerschot VAC, founded in 1899 by former Royal Antwerp players. They played at the Olympisch Stadion, the main venue of the 1920 Olympics. Nowadays KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk plays at the Olympisch Stadion in the Belgian Second Division.\nThe Antwerp Giants play in Basketball League Belgium and Topvolley Antwerpen play in the Belgium men's volleyball League.\nFor the year 2013, Antwerp was awarded the title of European Capital of Sport.\nAntwerp hosted the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nAntwerp hosted the start of stage 3 of the 2015 Tour de France on 6 July 2015.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\nAntwerp has a university and several colleges. The University of Antwerp  (Universiteit Antwerpen) was established in 2003, following the merger of the RUCA, UFSIA and UIA institutes. Their roots go back to 1852. The University has approximately 23,000 registered students, making it the third-largest university in Flanders, as well as 1,800 foreign students. It has 7 faculties, spread over four campus locations in the city centre and in the south of the city.\nThe city has several colleges, including Antwerp Management School (AMS), Charlemagne University College (Karel de Grote Hogeschool), Plantin University College (Plantijn Hogeschool), and Artesis University College (Artesis Hogeschool). Artesis University College has about 8,600 students and 1,600 staff, and Charlemagne University College has about 10,000 students and 1,300 staff. Plantin University College has approximately 3,700 students.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nThe following places are twinned with or sister cities to Antwerp:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Born in Antwerp ===\n\n\n=== Lived in Antwerp ===\n\n\n== Select neighbourhoods ==\nDen Dam \u2013 an area in northern Antwerp\nThe diamond district \u2013 an area consisting of several square blocks, it is Antwerp's centre for the cutting, polishing, and trading of diamonds\nLinkeroever \u2013 Antwerp on the left bank of the Scheldt with a lot of apartment buildings\nMeir \u2013 Antwerp's largest shopping street\nVan Wesenbekestraat \u2013 the city's Chinatown\nHet Zuid \u2013 the south of Antwerp, notable for its museums and Expo grounds\nZurenborg \u2013 an area between Central and Berchem station with a concentration of Art Nouveau townhouses\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntwerp Book Fair\nAntwerp lace\nAntwerp Water Works (AWW)\nJewish Community of Antwerp\nLetterenhuis\nList of mayors of Antwerp\nPshevorsk \u2013 Hassidic Jewish movement based in Antwerp\nRoyal Antwerp F.C., local football club\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nBlanchard, Ian.

          "Great for some photo opportunities but thats about it. Makes it more worthwhile if you have a guide who can you can tell you about the history and folklore. Not open to the public inside, what parts that are open are used for children's theater training. Still worth a look and",

          "It is next to the river Scheldt and it is an architecture cocktail compared to the whole city. I am not sure if you can go inside but at least you can have really nice walk around and in it. The statue, the trees next to it and the statue in front of it are also really",

          "This edifice was the defensive gate house at the river. The old city wall extended from both sides. Remnants can still be seen. It is possible to walk inside, but not particularly worth it. It is worth a few minutes to look at it from the exterior.",
          "It's a very beautiful castle to have pictures. However, I think it needs more than just being the castle. Normally it was having a place where you could go in, but doesn't focus on the legend of the castle and his giant. Would be cool if they do that. Anyways, you can follow the",
          "You can take some cute photos of the outside, but that's basically it. The inside had been converted into what looked like a restaurant\\event venue. Whatever it is was not open when we were there. Overall, it's quite small. There's nothing to do aside from take photos there.",

          "I think the main attraction is the beatiful look from outside, and the option to walk around the place and see the details while you're outside. So it is worth to visit if you're in the area, and it is only 5 minutes from the Cathedral, so if you're not in a hurry go there. It",
          "Really nice place to visit when you are in Antwerp. Excellent location to have a quiet walk along the waterfront and perfect and save area for kids. Also, they have a nice cafe inside the castle, where you can have some nice drinks and enjoy the view. They also have some toys",

          "This is a medieval castle. It starts with a bridge, a statue then you get into the inside. The castle retains its medieval structure and is one of the oldest buildings in Antwerp. There is a cafeteria inside too. Yet I would not say it is an impressive one. The good news is that",
          "We loved walking into this historic site which is stituated along the Schelde river & just a short walk from the Grote Markt. Yes, there is not a lot to buy or do, however everyone needs to remember that we normally do not see this in North America. I found the docked vessel",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Cathedral of Our Lady (Dutch: Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekathedraal) is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Antwerp, Belgium. Today's see of the Diocese of Antwerp started in 1352 and, although the first stage of construction was ended in 1521, has never been 'completed'. In Gothic style, its architects were Jan and Pieter Appelmans. It contains a number of significant works by the Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens, as well as paintings by artists such as Otto van Veen, Jacob de Backer and Marten de Vos.\nThe belfry of the cathedral is included in the Belfries of Belgium and France entry in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before 1124 ===\nThe first christian missionaries arrived in the 7th century. The first parish church dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul was constructed in the current Sint Michielsstraat. After the Viking raids in 836, the church was damaged and restored, and subsequently dedicated to Saint Michael. In the 10th century, a group of 12 secular canons were connected to this church. They would dedicate all of their time to the Liturgy of the Hours, and mainly opposed the beliefs of the established Roman Catholic Church. Upon hearing of their dissent behavior, the bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai (to which Antwerp belonged at the time) then sent Norbert of Xanten to discipline them. In 1124, Norbert of Xanten convinces 4 of the secular canons to start a norbertine abbey and thus the parish church becomes a monastery church, known as St. Michael's Abbey. The 8 other secular canons prefer to keep their freedom and move to a different location, a chapel dedicated to Our Lady, the Virgin Mary.This chapel becomes Antwerp's new parish church, and is located between the Saint Michael residential area, and an older settlement around the area of Het Steen. \n\n\n=== Our Lady\u2019s church ===\nBecoming more popular, the chapel is demolished and replaced by a much bigger romanesque church. The three-aisled nave corresponded in width to the cathedral's current central aisle, the inner and partly the middle aisles. The cloverleaf-shaped eastern section with a full aisle had a width of no less than 42 m. In 1294, the church gets a novum opus extension, indicating the first signs of gothic architecture.\n\n\n=== Our Lady's cathedral and damage ===\nIn 1352, construction was begun on a new Our Lady\u2019s church which would become the largest Gothic church in Belgium. In the beginning, it was to be provided with two towers of equal height. In 1521, after nearly 170 years, the new church of Our Lady was ready. The south tower reached only as far as the third-string course.\nDuring the night of 5\u20136 October 1533, the new church was largely gutted by fire, however Lancelot II of Ursel managed to save the building. The completion of the second tower was therefore delayed, which led to its ultimate postponement. Moreover, the church only became the cathedral of the bishopric of Antwerp in 1559 but lost this title again from 1801 to 1961, following the Concordat of 1801. During the Iconoclasm of 20 August 1566 (part of the Beeldenstorm at the start of the Eighty Years' War), Protestants destroyed a large part of the cathedral interior. The eye-witness Richard Clough, a Welsh Protestant merchant then in Antwerp, wrote that the cathedral: \"looked like a hell, with above 10,000 torches burning, and such a noise as if heaven and earth had got together, with falling of images and beating down of costly works, such sort that the spoil was so great that a man could not well pass through the church. So that in fine [short], I cannot write you in x sheets of paper the strange sight I saw there, organs and all destroyed.\"Nicolas Sander, an English Catholic exile who was a professor of theology at Louvain, described the destruction in the  church:\n\n... these fresh followers of this new preaching threw down the graven [sculpted] and defaced the painted images, not only of Our Lady but of all others in the town. They tore the curtains, dashed in pieces the carved work of brass and stone, brake the altars, spoilt the clothes and corporesses, wrested the irons, conveyed away or brake the chalices and vestiments, pulled up the brass of the gravestones, not sparing the glass and seats which were made about the pillars of the church for men to sit in. ... the Blessed Sacrament of the altar ... they trod under their feet and (horrible it is to say!) shed their stinking piss upon it ... these false bretheren burned and rent not only all kind of Church books, but, moreover, destroyed whole libraries of books of all sciences and tongues, yea the Holy Scriptures and the ancient fathers, and tore in pieces the maps and charts of the descriptions of countries.\nLater, when Antwerp came under Protestant administration in 1581, a number of artistic treasures were once again destroyed, removed or sold. The restoration of Roman Catholic authority came in 1585 with the fall of Antwerp.\nIn 1794 the French revolutionaries who conquered the region plundered Our Lady\u2019s Cathedral and inflicted serious damage. Around 1798, the French administration intended to demolish the building but after each blow, the cathedral was able to recover. In 1816, various important works of art were returned from Paris, including three Rubens masterpieces. Over the course of the 19th century, the church was completely restored and refurnished.\nBetween 1965 and 1993, a complete restoration took place.\n\n\n=== Musical life ===\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, the cathedral's choir started developing an active musical life, and as a result, the cathedral's importance in the history of music soon soared. Johannes Ockeghem, one of the most important composers of the 15th century, served here as a vicar-singer in 1443, and so did Jacob Obrecht between 1492 and 1497. Organists who worked at the cathedral include Henry Bredemers (1493\u20131501), who went on to become a teacher to Philip the Handsome's children and the renowned English composer John Bull (1615\u20131628), who fled to Flanders from his home country escaping justice. From 1725 to 1731 Willem de Fesch served as Kapelmeester, followed from 1731 to 1737 by Joseph-Hector Fiocco, and from 1737 by Andr\u00e9-Joseph Blavier. Lesser known but locally important figures, such as Jacobus Barbireau and Andreas Pevernage, also worked at the cathedral.\n\n\n== Significant architectural details ==\nThe church's one finished spire is 123 metres (404 ft) high, the highest church tower in the Benelux. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor commented that the spire should be kept under glass, and Napoleon compared the spire to Mechlin lace. The largest bell in the tower requires 16 bell ringers.The west portal features statues which include the missionary Saint Willibrord. He is thought to have spent time in Antwerp in the 7th century.\n\n\n== Major works of art ==\n\nThe cathedral possesses some major works of art :\n\nThe Raising of the Cross \u2013 Peter Paul Rubens\nAssumption of the Virgin Mary \u2013 Peter Paul Rubens\nThe Descent from the Cross \u2013 Peter Paul RubensTwo of these artworks were confiscated by Napoleon and moved to France, The Raising of the Cross (which was actually the main altar piece of the St Walburga church) and The Descent from the Cross, but were returned to the cathedral in the 19th century.\n\n\n== Burials ==\nInside the Cathedral some important graves still can be found, amongst them family members of the noble houses of Rubens, Fourment, Goubau, Tucher, Plantin, Moretus, de Borrekens, etc. Some stones were resited there after Saint-Michael's abbey church was lost.\n\n\n== Facts and figures ==\n\n\n=== gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nRynck, Patrick (2005).

          "Go in to admire the architecture, the history, the exquisite art on canvas/the walls/the windows, or to say a prayer... it will be worth it. This is one of those unique places, where despite the tour groups and the selfie-takers rushing in and out, one feels at peace and humbled",
          "Really beautiful exterior, interior is okay but the artis more of an appeal than the actual religious elemeants. Six euros for entry is really steep!!!",

          "The visit to this wonderful cathedral was amazing. So many beautiful things to see inside. The stain glass windows are so detailed and beautiful to look at There are paintings and statues all around and there are plenty of spaces for quiet contemplation. The cost is only \u20ac6",

          "Scandalous how a church dears to treat its visitors in this manner. You are charged no less than 6 EUR for a visit. I think it is time Jesus Christ came back to Earth to drive these Pharisees out of his church. Sorry, not for me. I'll take a look a the abundant pictures taken by",

          "The Cathedral benefits from space and light and is full of splendid art, from the pictures by Rubens and other greats, to the stained glass and the modern pieces. We particularly liked Diasporia by Koen Theys.",
          "We came here as part of a 1/2 day trip to Antwerp and the Cathedral is a must see place to visit. It\u2019s architecture is stunning both inside and outside. It has a very calming feel to it, wonderful stain glass windows and on top of that amazing paintings by Antwerp artist Rubens",
          "I agree with a number of other reviewers that the entry fee does seem excessive. That said from the outside the building is very beautiful and wonderfully lit at night. Inside there is much to see including a collection of art that would do justice to any good gallery. As one",

          "The architecture of the cathedral, even from the outside is already very pretty with very intrinsec details and a richness that you will have to stare at it for a long time to start noticing all the nuances. A cathedral in the spirits of Notre Dame but for which you have to pay",

          "From the outside it is a stunn, medieval cathedral with fantastic gothic architecture. However, once you pay the, in my opinion, rather expensive entrance fee, it's a tad disappointing. The stain glass windows are a joy, and the art on display is interesting enough, but the",
          "I have visited many cathedrals across Europe and few compare to the Cathedral of Our Lady. It's shear size is overwhelming. We stayed in a penthouse flat that looked right at it so we got to see it lit up at night as well. The interior is very ornate and it an area was being",
          "We were appalled to discover we had to pay to enter this Church because of the Peter Paul Rubens paintings. We felt very underwhelmed and didn't enjoy our visit at all. My favourite painting was by Frans Floris - The Adoration of the Shepherds.",
          "I visited here in December 2016 and you could just walk in and enjoy the Cathedral.Not now ! There is a 6 Euro entrance fee.Disgusting so i walked out. I do not agree with any fees to visit places like this.",

          "This buiding shows just how rich Antwerp was. It\u2019s still the highest church tower in the low countries. You have top art works inside like Rubens paintings. Take an hour and go inside!",

          "The beautiful lacy spire dominates the city and you can see it from everywhere - it was very atmospheric on a misty November morning. The cathedral is huge and even if you don't pay to go in and look around inside, you will get a great view of the lovely building from the Grote",
          "While visiting Antwerp Belgium for the day it was hard to miss this massively impressive strcture as part of old town. There is a lot of reconstruction and some gates closed due to this ongoing maintenance, but you can see it is intricate in design and overwhelmingly beautiful.",
          "The cathedral is beautiful and it feels like there is a museum inside. Definitely worth a visit while in Antwerp",

          "Cathedral of Our Lady is a stunning place to visit, if you love history you will love this building, it\u2019s huge the out side is as stunning as the inside. There is a charge of 6 Euro But worthwhile.",
          "It is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the Storic City center of Antwerp. The Gothic is not my favorite style but definitely this cathedral is worth to be seen. Of course you cannot miss the 4 master pieces of the well known artist P.P. Rubens. Open from 10 to 17 accept payment",
          "The Antwerp cathedral is impressive with its magnificent carvings, architecture and stain glass. It is currently being renovated on the outside. The Raising of the Cross [Rubens] and the Madonna of Antwerp are highlights. It is well worth a visit if you have the time while in",
          "Entrance is 8 euros and it appears there should have been an audio guide available but there was not which did limit our time there. There is a small booklet available, which outlines the major works of art and I believe there are tours but none when we were there. Inside the",

          "Very nice stained glass windows, some Reubens, inhale the quiet. About a b minus on the cathedral scale.",

          "That towers over Antwerp. A gothic building, rising high above the city. Visit the interior with beautiful sculptures, paintings (Rubens etc...)if there is an opportunity to have a guided tour, just do it. Try to walk around the building, it tells a lot about its history.",
          "A bit strange to have to pay for entering a church (\u20ac4 for 1 adult), but otherwise ok. Very long waiting line when I was there (sunday). A stop I would recommend in Antwerp, maybe for 30min-1h to appreciate the artworks by artists such as Rubens.",
          "Came after a wander to the historic quarter. 6 euros each but worth it. Rubens and other famous painters paintings all on site. Fantastic carvings, alters and naeves. Crypt only worth it if you like archaecolgical foundations. Great architecture overall.",

          "We visit many churches and Cathedrals when in Europe but this one is particularly interesting because it contains some Pierre Paul Rubens art, in particular the famous raising and lowering of the cross paintings of Christ. Well worth popping in, especially after visiting Rubens\u2019",
          "Obviously the Rubens altarpieces etc are the main draw, and well worth seeing. However, until the Fine Art museum re-opens there is a wonderful exhibition of altarpieces that were removed during the religious troubles and for the moment they are being shown in situ. As a",
          "Just a slight inconvence but much of Antwerp is being improved or renovated including many Churches.",
          "The cathedral overlooks the city and can be seen from a distance. Standing at the front of the catherdral looking up at the tower, you get a sense of the grandness of this place of worship. Some parts are under construction/restoration. There are guided tours that end by 5pm",

          "The draw here is the alter pieces painted by Rubens. They are wonderful. But the other alter pieces are also worth a view. I enjoyed wandering around the church and viewing all of the various ones and reading about their history. The stained glass windows and various alcove",

          "We were using this landmark to guide us around the city - kind of a mistake. In several European cities, you can use the tallest cathedral as the landmark to let you know where you are, where you need to head. But in Antwerp, there are streets, neighborhoods where you can't",
          "I'm in no way a religious person nor a historian, but you can't help be drawn to visit the Cathedral. Such an imposing building. If you like your history or architecture or are religious in any way, step inside and be amazed at what you see. Walked around independently but I",

          "Its a beautiful Gothic building but seems to pay homage more to Ruben and his contemporaries than to God. There are numerous stunning paintings all through the cathedral, along with some modern sculptures and diaspora. With visitors running around with cameras , it can be easy",
          "Nice to see some changes in the display of art in the cathedral. Rubens will attract a large crowd but credits should be given to modern artists. Fabulous statue of Jan Fabre, who likes to reach out for the sky in some of his statues. Contemporary interpretation of the problems",

          "6 Euro admission for adults, but worth it. The admission fee is during tourist hours, but keep in mind that admission is paying for restoration and ongoing maintenance of the church. Well worth the price!",

          "Went to visit the cathedral which was close to the hotel. Was surprised to find that there was a charge of \u20ac6 to enter the cathedral. Doesn't the church have enough money not to make a charge - like so many other cathedrals in European cities?",
          "Seen from far and standing tall in the middle of the city, the Katedraal, is definitely worth a visit for its details + artworks (Rubens anyone?) displayed. From the top you have a 360 view of old and new Antwerp.",
          "The cathedral is a delight to visit. The gothic architecture is impressive as is the artwork by various artists that are displayed at the different alters throughout the church. Most notable are the three pieces by Peter Paul Rubens. It was so nice to wander though here and read",

          "Not only does this church have amazing religious relics and artefacts but the paintings are entirely worth a visit. We were there with our 10 and 18 year old who were also equally impressed by the splendour of the cathedral and art work. The cathedral is the largest Gothic",
          "If you are interested in gothic cathedrals, do not limit yourself to England, France or Germany. Together with Saint Stephen in Vienna, the cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp is the most impressive and enchanting example of late gothic architecture in Europe. It is a marvel!",

A couple of significant Rubens masterpieces are present but there\u2019s plenty more to see",

          "The interesting thing about this Cathedral is that it is so tucked away in central Antwerp that it is actually not easy to find! It is surrounded by the medieval buildings (now largely shops and restaurants) and only has a small courtyard in front. Once you turn the last corner",

          "It will cost you 6 euros but it is worth it to see the art from the Flemish masters. Take your time and look at each niche. Everyone is different and has its own beauty. The plaques are in over six different languages explaining the art and its painters. Don't forget to go",

          "The cathedral took 170 years to build. And has gone through a 20 year resauration. When you see the cathedral on the outside it's massive in size. And impressive. Once you're inside you will understand why it took so long to build and to renovate. The result is really worth to",
          "Magnificent interior to this cathedral built between the 14th and 16th centuries. Nice to sit down and contemplate the interior. There are several large masterpieces by Peter Paul Rubens and also an interesting contemporary bronze sculpture \"The man who bears the cross\".",
          "Absolutely stunning architecture detail on this beautiful church. You can't miss it when visiting Antwerp as the main tower dominates the skyline. Apparently there was to be a matching tower but the funds ran out so there is just one.",

          "I think there are two types of European church visitors. Those who love every church and those who see one, and kind of see them all. I normally am the second type. But this one was different - the Rubens paintings make this as much an art museum as a church. The works of",

          "I wish I could give this place a better review, but I did not leave myself enough time while I was in Antwerp to neither go around the whole outside or to go inside. The ouside is very impressive and like much of Antwerp, a must see. A person could spend hours looking at the",
          "If you thought the cathedral of Antwerp is just a \"walk in and walk out\" experience, you should rub your eyes again. A bit annoying to pay a fee, to enter the church first, but offers hundreds of christian artworks, described and analysed clearly. This is a church, yes, but",
          "Fantastic cathedral, highly worth a visit. The entrance was a little expensive (6\u20ac per person) but it was worth the price having both the architecture, pictures of Rubens and the atmosphere in one place. You can also visit the crypt under ground for those interested. I'm not",
          "The Cathedral is located in the heart of Antwerp surrounded by other historic buildings. So it does not stand apart in its own grounds like some cathedrals elsewhere but forms an integral part of the historic centre of then City. It's main draw inside are the Rubens paintings.",

          "It is one of the most beautiful churches that I have visited. The restaurations are going back into the history of the church. You can see how it was some centuries ago. The paintings of Rubens are really amazing. It's really nice to see that the different guilds are present in",
          "Really enjoyed viewing the architecture of the building as well as the collection of old paintings. We didn't have a lot of time in Antwerp, so this was high on our list to visit, and we weren't disappointed. Only tiny thing was getting used to paying an entrance fee to visit",
          "This cathedral is so interesting that it is worth paying a good guide to get information. The beautifull Rubens paintings, the mediaan indicator crossing the cathedral, the decoration,... go and see it yourself",
          "i am not a catholic man but this place is inside out very impressive ... to have build this monument gives a good view of what people are capable to, averse to connecting it with a religion ...",
          "Starting with the city's largest church, the Cathedral of Our Lady, that resembled a white rocket ship. This is a must see church in the center of the Old City and is FREE! The inside of the cathedral was mind-blowing, though the plastic seats were a bit cheesy. For more",
          "You're not seeing that much of the cathedral, it's beautiful ofcourse but not that beautiful to be honest.",
          "Cathedral of Our Lady is a beautiful cathedral with a soaring tower that can be seen from far off. It is in the heart of Antwerp's pedestrian district. What is particularly striking about the cathedral is that it has a series of large paintings by masters like Peter Paul Rubens,",
          "Beautiful cathedral, lots of chapels. Very rich decorated! I cannot recommend a visit with small children.",
          "What a beautiful church. The Ruben Art Display was on while we were there, and that was a Bonus. We tool a free guided tour by a local volunteer and it was very interesting. The guide was terrific; he know his history and presented it in humorous way. It is a Must-to-See while",

          "The Cathedral of Our Lady is beautiful on the inside and it has 3 Rubens paintings. Currently (May 2017) the Museum of Fine Arts is closed for renovations so the Rubens are in the church which was the place for which they were originally painted. This is a great chance to see",

          "We went to Sunday Mass at this cathedral. While we could not understand the language Mass is the same all over the world. It was amazing to sit in a very old church surrounded by paintings of a great master. The beauty of the building is worth the time just to stop in",
          "Begun in the mid-14th Century, the Cathedral of Our Lady was finished 170 years later, though the second tower was only partially complete. It is the largest Gothic church in Belgium. The interior is lavish, displaying Antwerp's immense wealth that could be dedicated to the",
          "I know when you think of Europe, you think of lots and lots of cathedrals.... well this one is stunning! The architecture, the work inside, the ceilings.... I cannot begin to say how mesmerized we were. The location is in the center of Antwerp with really cool shops around!",
          "As a fan of city breaks, visiting cathedrals is a must on my 'to do' list. Antwerp's Cathedral of Our Lady is lovely. It is large and spacious inside , with a lot of religious art to view- paintings, statues and some beautiful triptychs. There is a calm atmosphere here, no-one",
          "This place is unbelievable. Definitely my favorite one from all the ones I visited in Europe. A mix of styles and so much history.",

          "Some good painting are there from Ruben and nice architecture. Its not extraordinary but its best cathedral in Antwerp.",

          "It is virtually impossible to miss this tall tower and a half in old town Antwerp. The second tower began much later than the first, but was stopped well before it became the intended twin tower. The real treasures are on the inside, with great artworks and architecture, as well",
          "My wife & I caught the English speaking tour. It lasted 1 hour and was definitely worthwhile. The guide offered up a whole series of insights that would otherwise go unnoticed.... from an extraordinary carved wood pulpit to the hanging Rubens paintings. This is a \"must see\"",

          "The cathedral in the historic district of Antwerp is impressive. The spire literally soars 400 feet. We did not choose to visit the inside, but we took many shots of the church from multiple angles. It is irresistibly photogenic. There is a pleasant restaurant district one",
          "Not everyone is a fan of churches, so I try to keep the visits to special ones. This one meets the bar with its beautiful architecture and wonderful contents. Even the teenagers each found a memorable painting to gaze at.",
          "One of the most beautiful cathedrals in the world ! Worth taking the time to look all around and to listen to the carillon . Do not miss the replica close to the main entrance !",
          "From the exterior it is striking, and while I didn't go inside, the paintings in there are said to be beautiful. I particularly liked the statue outside depicting the cathedral being built. Not necessarily a stop that takes up a lot of time, but certainly one that is worthwhile.",
          "Unlike some other churches in Antwerp, this one is on nearly full display and can be viewed from many different angles. A striking view is looking towards the front of the church from near the river. The cathedral is full of interesting elements and exceptional artwork. The",

          "This was my first trip outside the U.S. and I knew we were going to visit several cathedrals. This was my favorite. It's probably because I like the Rubens works better than other artwork I saw, but there was also something about this cathedral that moved me more than the",
          "Totally worth a visit while in Antwerp. The cathedral is incredibly beautiful on the inside and there are beautiful paintings inside. Must see the Rubens paintings! We also were able to see and learn about the crypt below the cathedral. Such a marvelous building---we spent ~60",
          "Not only is the exterior well worth seeing but the wood carving within is second to none, good enough to compare with Grinling Gibbons. There are some superb 'Old Master' paintings to see too.",
          "Nobody would miss the chance to visit the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antverp during their visit to Belgium. The paintings inside the Cathedral were particularly worth for detailed viewing. Apart from internally, stroll around the Cathedral from outside and take whatever photos",
          "Walk anywhere underneath the Cathedral's tower and when the carillon starts playing, you will stop, look up and marvel. The tower is THE symbol for Antwerp and their (chauvinistic) people love the landmark. Inside there is a magnificent collection of Flemish painters, including",
          "I stayed for part of the mass at 10 am on Sunday. It's gorgeous and the story is one tower is taller than the other because the man commissioned to build it ran out of sons. Lovely art inside too.",
          "The Our lady cathedral is one of the landmarks in Antverp. The strong Roman catholic presence in medieval Belgium allowed to build such cathedrals. There are so many in a small kingdom of Belgium. We enjoyed them all.",

          "The Cathedral spires can be seen from all over Antwerp. It is crowded by many other buildings and must be seen as a whole by seeking out various vantage points. The interior is moderately well lit by usual church standards. There are many side altars and lots of great art.",
          "Though its beauty is hidden on the outside by the other old buildings, once inside you experience a real work of art. There is an entrance fee but definitely worth it.",

          "5 pieces of Rubens and many more works of his contemporaries (that we actually liked better) in the fantastic cathedral - well worth a visit.",
          "For a great Catholic Cathedral this has little gold gilt but a fantastic collection of Flemish painted alter pieces. Lovely building too and if you look at the charge as a price to see the pictures it's not such a sin!",
          "The Cathedral of Our Lady traces its origins to 1120 AD and after nearly 170 years of construction the outline of spire of the Cathedral dominated the city of Antwerp's skyline around the 16th century. The Gothic Church dedicated to Virgin Mary has many works of art by",

          "This isn't the most spectacular church on the planet especially inside, but that's beside the point....to my mind it's fundamentally and morally corrupt for the catholic church, who let's face it aren't exactly broke, to be charging people to visit an alleged house of",
          "A charge to go in and it is not a peaceful place but is set out to display the famous art works, worth seeing though and a magnificent building from the outside",

          "The exterior view and atmosphere around the cathedral was great. But in comparison with other cathedrals it has average interior. It has also beautiful paintings that's hanged from pillars. The guide notes in dutch, french, german, english and Spanish were useful.",
          "Was on Vantage river cruise, Antwerp was our last port and what a city worth visiting! Our tour guide gave us a fun and interesting city tour. Lots of belgium chocolate shops and Belgium beer cafes. One of the most beautiful square to visit. The Church of on Lady offers free",
          "As I understand it, this is the only place you can see Michaelangelos work outside Italy! The statue is beautiful and they have many other works of art on display. It is currently being renovated, but you can still see lots. You buy your ticket for entrance across the street",
          "The cathedral is free to enter if there is a mass on but you cannot wander around. If you wish to visit outside service times it is quite expensive.",
          "I was disappointed because you have to pay to visit a church. I believe that's not the point of a church, it is supposed to be a public free and safe place.",

        "wiki": "The Plantin-Moretus Museum (Dutch: Plantin-Moretusmuseum) is a printing museum in Antwerp, Belgium which focuses on the work of the 16th-century printers Christophe Plantin and Jan Moretus. It is located in their former residence and printing establishment, the Plantin Press, at the Vrijdagmarkt (Friday Market) in Antwerp, and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2005.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe printing company was founded in the 16th century by Christophe Plantin, who obtained type from the leading typefounders of the day in Paris. Plantin was a major figure in contemporary printing with interests in humanism; his eight-volume, multi-language Plantin Polyglot Bible with Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek and Syriac texts was one of the most complex productions of the period. Plantin's is now suspected of being at least connected to members of heretical groups known as the Familists, and this may have led him to spend time in exile in his native France.\n\nAfter Plantin's death it was owned by his son-in-law Jan Moretus. While most printing concerns disposed of their collections of older type in the eighteenth and nineteenth century in response to changing tastes, the Plantin-Moretus company \"piously preserved the collection of its founder.\"In 1876 Edward Moretus sold the company to the city of Antwerp. One year later the public could visit the living areas and the printing presses. The collection has been used extensively for research, by historians H. D. L. Vervliet, Mike Parker and Harry Carter. Carter's son Matthew would later describe this research as helping to demonstrate \"that the finest collection of printing types made in typography's golden age was in perfect condition (some muddle aside) [along with] Plantin's accounts and inventories which names the cutters of his types.\"In 2002 the museum was nominated as UNESCO World Heritage Site and in 2005 was inscribed onto the World Heritage list.\nThe Plantin-Moretus Museum possesses an exceptional collection of typographical material. Not only does it house the two oldest surviving printing presses in the world and complete sets of dies and matrices, it also has an extensive library, a richly decorated interior and the entire archives of the Plantin business, which were inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 2001 in recognition of their historical significance.\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\na Bible in five languages: Biblia Polyglotta (1568-1573)\nThesaurus Teutoniae Linguae by Cornelis Kiliaan\na geographical book: Theatrum Orbis Terrarum made by Abraham Ortelius\na book describing herbs: Cruydeboeck made by Rembert Dodoens\nan anatomical book made by Andreas Vesalius and Joannes Valverde\na book about decimal numbers from Simon Stevin\na 36-line Bible\npaintings and drawings by Peter Paul Rubens\nthe study of humanist Justus Lipsius and many of his works\nsome of the materials used by French type designer and printer Robert Granjon\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistory of printing\nRenaissance humanism in Northern Europe\nMax Rooses\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nVoet, Leon (1969), The Golden Compasses: a history and evaluation of the printing and publishing activities of the Officina Plantiniana at Antwerp.

          "We were really looking forward to seeing this museum but we were so utterly disappointed. First, the printing side - almost nothing is in English and there were no audio guides of any kind available. In fact, the ticket lady was so busy with her computer it took a few minutes",
          "very interesting collection of printing presses, typesetting machinery and many old books, all housed in a well preserved house that is in itself very interesting to see. Well worth the admission price and easy to find close to the cathedral in the old section of Antwerp.",

        "wiki": "The Red Star Line was a shipping line founded in 1871 as a joint venture between the International Navigation Company of Philadelphia, which also ran the American Line, and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme de Navigation Belgo-Am\u00e9ricaine of Antwerp, Belgium. The company's main ports of call were Antwerp in Belgium, Liverpool and Southampton in the United Kingdom and New York City and Philadelphia in the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe company was founded by Clement Griscom, who led it from its founding until the International Mercantile Marine Co. took it over in 1902. Red Star Line survived IMM's financial crisis in 1915. In the 1930s Red Star Line was part of Arnold Bernstein Line.The company declared bankruptcy in 1934. It operated until 1935 when it ceased trading. Its assets were eventually sold to the Holland America Line.\n\n\n== Heritage ==\n\nThe former warehouses of the Red Star Line in Antwerp were designated as a landmark and reopened as a museum on 28 September 2013 by the City of Antwerp. The main focus of the museum is the travel stories that could be retrieved through relatives of the some two million Red Star Line passengers. In the exhibition the visitor follows the travelers' tracks from the travel agency in Warsaw until their arrival in New York. The museum exhibits works of art depicting the Red Star Line emigrants by the Antwerp artist Eugeen Van Mieghem (1875-1930), together with Red Star Line memorabilia from the collection of Robert Vervoort.About a quarter of the some two million Red Star Line migrants were Jews, largely from Eastern Europe until the exodus driven by the rise of Nazi Germany.

          "The museum shows the exodus from Europe to the USA at the height of the Red Star Line, many well known names travelled through Antwerp to New York and onward; some of their stories are told.",
          "Interesting museum. I like the old building and the artifacts it had, but it would have been better if it had more artifacts. There were plenty of photos to tell the emigrants story, providing a taste of what it was like having to pass through there. What would have been nice",
          "This museum presents the history of migrants leaving Europe and heading for America. The whole process of leaving your home and heading off to the unknown is beautifully brought to life by many personal histories, photos, films etc. I enjoyed this museum immensely and advise you",
          "The theme of the museum is migrations and if you are going for ship building you may be disappointed. There are English translations throughout although they are missing in some places which was a pity. The memorabilia was most interesting.",
          "This museum brings interesting view into the history of migration with the boat to America in its time conditions, but also the link to other historical and nowadays (economical) migration is a good education, especially because of areas addressed that are not part of normal",
          "This is possibly the best museum I've ever visited. It presents a restrained yot analytical view of the whole uncomfortable process of migration through which generations of Europeans from the past went in their search for a better life across the Atlantic. Sometimes quirky,",
          "Everybody knows Ellis Island, the mandatory gateway to living in the USA for millions of European immigrants in the 19th and 20th century. But who is aware of the fact that many of those begun their Atlantic crossing in the Flemish port of Antwerp? The Museum of the Red Star",
          "The museum is located in Antwerp's upcoming trendy neighbourhood \"Het Eilandje\", home to many really nice bars and restaurants and close to the MAS museum, which is also worth a visit. Very helpful and friendly staff will greet you at the entrance in one of the original Red",

          "Very interesting museum with lots of information which will open your eyes. Good for kids and adult to refresh the memory",
          "Very interactive. You can spend many hours if you read everything. So much information. But you can make it shorter too. What I like a lot is that you learn about the Red Star Line and emigration from this side of he ocean which you can link to the museum of Ellis Island in NY",
          "If you are from North America, you would probably want to visit this museum. It shows the struggle of European immigrants in seeking new life in the new world. I am not 100% certain about this but if you know someone who was on one of their ships, you may be able to search for",
          "We were surprises hoe much we learnt about migration and most common reasons. OMG people had a lot of time spent in cleaning, travelling, bureaucracy.",
          "It was so interesting to get to know about the stories of emigrants to the US/Canada, where in Europe they came from and how it shaped the city of Antwerp. We spent almost 5 hours inside the museum, reading through the abundance of interesting stories and watching videos. It's",
          "We came here as my partner has tracked family that travelled on and worked for the Red Star Line. It was incredible to walk through the building and see the stories of emigration from all over Europe to North America - whether the attempt was successful or not. This is not",
          "Cold and raining outside, what better thing to do than step inside, pay your money and wander around this small but interesting museum? Charting the exodus of millions of people from mittel Europe to the land of hope and Trump.....",
          "Innthis museum you can see how people from Europe try to go for them the new world, the place for new beginnings In which condition they embarked on the ship How the Jewish people fled from Europe It is quite a different kind of story than what migration means now Quite a",
          "This is one of the top things to do in Antwerp. My husband and I had a great visit to this museum. Its really interesting and gives you a good insight into what life was like in the port of Antwerp back when people passed though on their way to America. It took us about 2",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Red Star Line Museum. Good for all ages - a lot of interactive exhibits. Our kids enjoyed learning about emigration from Europe via Antwerp. We spent about 2 hours going through the museum.",
          "The role played by the Red Star Line of ships transporting people from Antwerp to America throughout the history of the shipping line is very well explained. It gives political, historic and economic aspects as well as following the lives of individuals who travelled aboard the",
          "We like to go to a museum every time we go on holiday. This museum took us on a trip from Antwerp to America as third class passengers. There is an area downstairs with lockers to leave Ur bags. The guy on the desk will give u a ticket for the locker. There looked to be a",

          "Visited here via train from Liege, Belgium (transferred in Brussels North Station). When you arrive in Antwerp Central Station, take bus #17 (3 euros) to the terminus. When you get off here, there are some signs posted to guide you to the MAS museum. I bought a combo ticket,",
          "This museum was by far, the best museum I've ever been to. It was very spacious, full of interesting and true stories and interactive for children. Highly, highly recommend this incredible place",
          "Very nice exhibition about the mass migration to USA and Canada. But it seemed the staff are not used to children visitors and kept telling us off and lecturing us about our chidren (8,6 and 4 yrs old). Not very relaxing.",
          "A bit of the beaten track but definitely a must when learning about the history of Antwerp. Everybody knows that the harbor played an important role in the development of the city. Next to the goods however this museum tells the story of the people that briefly inhabited Antwerp",
          "Very good museum. Explains the whole situation of the European exodus to America in great detail and in some cases very harrowing. Highly recommended",
          "I was a little wary since there were very few people around but it was a great experience. Less people is good anyway. Gave us time to read most of the information as there is a lot.",
          "First a couple of practical things. This museum does not take cash for its entry fee, you will need to take a credit card, and if you are an English speaker make sure you are given the little book they keep for exhibits not in English. Much of the museum has English captions but",
          "The museum is quite interesting. To see some personal stories of the people who left and why was touching and made the experience personal. Then you go through everything that happened here and also they show you what the voyage was like. All of this was done through personal",
          "It is about 20min walk from city centre and 5min walk from Mas Museum (very cool building). The museum is fascinating, everything designed for visitors and with the book you get while paying for tickets you will learn a lot of things. Museums content is very rich, also at the",
          "This was a very interesting 2 hours. Learning about Europeans struggles and reasons for hoping for a new life in North America was insightful. The displays are quite interesting and mostly eye catching. They're are parts solely in Dutch but if you tell them you speak English",
          "Fantastic museum, well roganized, excellent content, and an engaging flow to the exhibits. An absolute treasure.",
          "This is a fascinating museum which tells the story of emigrants from all over Europe to the US and Canada. It sets this in the context of an ongoing history of immigration. The story is told through imaginative and interesting interactive displays. Almost everything is",
          "Very enjoyable visit to this museum whilst in port on CMV's Columbus. Recommended by friends it was not included in our port guide and we were glad to have heard about it. I believe that it is has only been open for two or three years and is very well set out. There is a",
          "Visitors buy an entrance ticket which looks like a ticket to board the ship... inviting them to go on the same voyage thousands of people have taken when they fled to the promised land. You walk in their footsteps, see the place they were checked for lice, the luggage, the",
          "This museum is almost a mirror image of Ellis Island. It tells the history of the migration of 20 million Europeans to the US and Canada. It is very well done and well laid out. You get a feel for what it must have been like to leave Europe and head to North America. Would",
          "With photo's, pictures, films, documents and personal luggages the museum gives a very nice and interesting overview of the emigration from Europe to America in the first half of the 20th century, before and after the 1st World War and before the 2nd World War. It summarizes",
          "It's sometimes amazing what you find out about a cities past. 12m people from all over Europe sailed from Antwerp to USA ant the sorry of those travellers also amazing. Take your time to hear some of the stories.",
          "See this masterpiece for yourself. Leave 2-3 hours minimum and step into our history. Good for all ages.",
          "My husband and I went to the Red Star Line Museum with much anticipation for a great experience and we were not let down. I am a teacher and my husband an immigrant from Ireland to the U.S. and a lover of history. The museum explained immigration and emigration from not only",
          "Take at least half a day to visit this lovely museum. Interesting stories of (descendants) of people who emigrated to the USA or Canada from Antwerp in the late 19th / early 20th century. Interactive, videoclips etc. Also interesting history of the Red Star Line company.",
          "This museum tells the history off people from Belgium, France, Germany and Russia, and many more to go overseas to the new world America to try and find a better life. In this museum you will be able to follow the voyages off these people, but also find familymembers who live",

          "I could have spent all day here. We came because we've traced family members traveling through this port back on the 1890s. It was amazing being where they stood and learning about what they did in those places while trying to move to the US. If you are an American with any",
          "After work a guide tour in the Museum. Also possible with audio guided tour if you want to do it on your own tempo. A must do when you are in Antwerp. Near to the MAS",
          "This museum is really well set out and covers all aspects of The Red Star line in a really interesting manner. The renovation of the premises itself is superb and there is a large area to sit and have a snack/beer at the end of the tour. Highly recommended",

          "This museum tells the story of 2 million Europeans who left Europe to try their luck in the new world. We saw on Ellis Island their arrival in America. We saw here the start of their journey!",
          "I suppose it's quite interesting when one of your family members has been one of the crew or travelers on the boat, then it would've been very interesting. But for me as an outsider it was (sorry) not interesting.",
          "This museum brings you the story of the many emmigrants that travelled through Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century to make their way to America via the ships of the Red Star Line. The museum is located in the buildings where potential emmigrants were checked for",
          "If you have gone to Ellis Island you need to see this museum. This is the other side of the story, why people left everything to come to America. We learned what people gave up and left behind to come to America to pursue their dreams. Plan to spend a few hours here and",
          "Very interesting and informative exhibition. A clear and logical setup for visiting, museum map is included in ticket. That the museum is actually located in the original building of the RSL makes it even more exciting. You can also climb up to the, kind of modern, observation",
          "This is a great museum, and well worth the effort. I had no idea of the extent of the migrant trail which took place through Antwerp to North America. Some of the stories were quite vivid depictions of the harsh conditions, both before and during the voyages. It is very well",
          "Ellis Island is an iconic place & time in American history. This museum focuses on the point of embarcation for most Europeans emigrating to the USA through Ellis Island. It's a fascinating story and not to be missed.",
          "The red star line museum organised A special event at the museum with songs and literature. We went and enjoyed.... the building and location all add to a Great Discovery of the museum. Also the fact of having the personal stories of people going to America was nice.",
          "In this great building a remarkable story is being told. But for some reason my hunger for information was not satisfied afterwards. It is centered around the personal stories of people who emigrated via the Antwerp harbor which makes it very touching. But the stories seem to",
          "Very interesting museum as it presents the life of an immigrant on such high detail: reasons, illegal border passing to Antwerp, medical tests, life on the ship, real letters sent back home from the USA. This topic may be a niche, but if you're interested in modern history,",
          "I had no idea that there was a Red Star Shipping Company nor the famous people (Albert Einstein, Irving Berlin) who were lucky enough to escape Europe and come to the USA.",
          "Look for a Red Star building and find the entrance at the flags on the end but mind the trash from the night clubs. good history of emigration post sailing ship (go to Cork, Ireland for that) with most but not all in English. The museum is clearly developing and the store",
          "The Red Star Line Museum presents an interesting view of 19th and early 20th century emigration from continental Europe through the harbor of Antwerp. It is, in a sense, the other end of the line from Ellis Island and many other ports of entry in the Americas. Many interesting",
          "Amazed by the authenticity of the story. Last year also visited New York and Ellis Island, the other side of the trip. In fact, The Red star Line Museum was way better!",

          "If you want to feel and understand how it can be to leave home, relatives, friends, everything behind, or if you would like to see the recent wave of migration in a historic context, come here for two hours. The museum is in the same building and the exhibition brings you",
          "Interesting museum depicting the experiences of the many people who boarded a ship at Antwerp to emigrate. Plenty of personal accounts add to the authenticity of this museum. Basic information is written in 3 languages in each new section, however you will need to read further",
          "Many immigration museums are at sites of arrival; this one is interesting because it's at a site of departure. There's lots to see, so don't spend too much time on the initial exhibit on worldwide migration (besides, there are some debatable perspectives), but move on to the",

          "This is a lovingly presented tribute to the million people who left from here to go to North America. Some of the film is not of Antwerp, but the overall effect is very powerful. I much prefer it to the MAS.",
          "A very interesting, very in-depth look at the Red Star line and the role it played in the emigration of millions to the US over the years. Some sad stories, some uplifting, and you really get a sense of being part of that history while walking through the exhibits. Well worth a",
          "Fascinating and very well done museum which chronicles Antwerp's role as the departure point for the mass migration from Europe to North American between 1850 and 1930. Not to be missed if your ancestors immigrated to the US or Canada during this period. The exhibits tell the",

          "The investment in making this side of Antwerp's history come alive was clearly considerable and for the most part successful. There is some very good multi media material with stories of emigrants on their way to the USA . The criticism I would make is that the Flemish pride",
          "I only wish I'd allowed myself more time to spend at the Red Star Line Museum. It's a fascinating museum with displays about the boats, the passengers and the processes as well as about migration throughout history. I particularly enjoyed the little information panels talking",

          "The museum is north of the city centre in an area of dockland undergoing redevelopment. Once we had navigated through the roadworks to support the tram extension we found the museum, located in the former Red Star Line buildings. The museum tells the store of the shipping line",

          "The story of this museum is unique, well, except for Ellis Island in New York. It gives a good insight in how it must have felt for those people that left Europe for a better life in America. It is not a huge museum and it uses a quite traditional approach for a museum, but that",
          "We visited this museum. It was easy accessible for our wheelchair bound loved one. Having visited Ellis island near New York City, USA, this Belgian museum provided a pre-immigration perspective on how the USA government pushed immigration to the departure locations. The museum",

        "wiki": "Antwerp ( (listen); Dutch: Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen); French: Anvers [\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281s] (listen)) is a city in Belgium and the capital of Antwerp province in the Flemish Region. With a population of 520,504, it is the most populous city proper in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people, it is the second largest metropolitan region after Brussels.Antwerp is on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe and within the top 20 globally. The city is also known for its diamond industry and trade.\nBoth economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt. Antwerp was also the place of the world's oldest stock exchange building, originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872.The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren (Dutch pronunciation: [s\u026a\u0272\u02c8jo\u02d0r\u0259(n)]), after the Spanish honorific se\u00f1or or French seigneur, \"lord\", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century. The city hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is New Latin.A Germanic (Frankish or Frisian) origin could contain prefix anda (\u201cagainst\u201d) and a noun derived from the verb werpen (\u201cto throw\u201d) and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit; a mound (like a terp) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf. If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean \"those who live on both banks\".There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river. He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt.\n\n\n=== Pre-1500 ===\nHistorical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952\u20131961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. The earliest mention of Antwerp dates from the 4th century.\nIn the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks.The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II, a border province facing the County of Flanders.\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon,  was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nAfter the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant, grew in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly enslaved Africans as the century progressed. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544\u20131574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became \"the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height.\" Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the \"Age of Exploration\". During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps.  Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas\".\n\nWithout a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venetian Republic, Republic of Ragusa, Spain and Portugal.  Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \"To the merchants of all nations.\" Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers.  In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth.  Numerous financial bankruptcies  began around 1557. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nThe religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries. The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury: 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over \u00a32 million sterling of damage was done.\n\n\n=== Dutch revolt ===\nSubsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa, and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock) and an access- lock and mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.\n\nIn 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chass\u00e9. For a time Chass\u00e9 subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass\u00e9 made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi)  from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAntwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During World War I, the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Li\u00e8ge. The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.\nAntwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. \nDuring World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote, V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic) Orthodox Judaism.\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into nine entities (districts):\n\nAntwerp\nBerchem\nBerendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo\nBorgerhout\nDeurne\nEkeren\nHoboken\nMerksem\nWilrijkIn 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp, the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.\n\n\n== Buildings and landmarks ==\n\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was noted for the wealth of its citizens (\"Antwerpia nummis\"). The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the Hanseatic League on the northern quays, in 1891. During World War II, the city also suffered considerable damage from V-bombs, and in recent years, other noteworthy buildings have been demolished for new developments.\n\nAntwerp Zoo opened in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the world.\nAntwerp City Hall dates from 1565, and is built primarily in Renaissance style.\nAntwerp Central Station is a railway station designed by Louis Delacenserie which was completed in 1905.\nCathedral of Our Lady. This church was begun in the 14th century and finished in 1518. The church has four works by Rubens, viz. \"The Descent from the Cross\", \"The Elevation of the Cross\", \"The Resurrection of Christ\" and \"The Assumption\"\nSt. James' Church, is more ornate than the cathedral. It contains the remains of numerous famous nobles, among them a major part of the family of Rubens.\nThe Church of St. Paul has a baroque interior. It is a few hundred yards north of the Grote Markt\nSt. Andrew's Church\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church\nMuseum Vleeshuis (Butchers' Hall) is a fine Gothic brick-built building, situated a short distance to the North-West of the Grote Markt.\nPlantin-Moretus Museum preserves the house of the printer Christoffel Plantijn and his successor Jan Moretus\nThe Saint-Boniface Church is an Anglican church and headseat of the archdeanery North-West Europe.\nBoerentoren (Farmers' Tower) or KBC Tower, a 26-storey building built in 1932, is the oldest skyscraper in Europe. It is the tallest building in Antwerp and the second tallest structure after the Cathedral of our Lady. The building was designed by Emiel van Averbeke, R. Van Hoenacker and Jos Smolderen.\nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts\nMuseum Mayer van den Bergh, with works from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nRubenshuis is the former home and studio of Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) in Antwerp. It is now a museum.\nRockox House is the former 17th-century Residence of Nicolaas II Rockox, lord Mayor of Antwerp.\nBourse of Antwerp. Originally built 1531; extensively restored 1872; now Antwerp Trade Fair.\nPalace of Justice, designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006. This building is the antithesis of the heavy, dark court building, designed by Joseph Poelaert, which dominates the skyline of Brussels. The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built on the site of the old Zuid (\"South\") station, at the end of a magnificent 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12). The building's highest 'sail' is 51 m (167 ft) high, has a floor area of 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft), and cost \u20ac130 million.\nZurenborg, a late-19th-century Belle \u00c9poque neighbourhood, on the border of Antwerp and Berchem, with many Art Nouveau architectural elements. The area counts as one of the most original Belle \u00c9poque urban expansion areas in Europe.\nMuseum aan de Stroom\nDen Botaniek or Antwerp's Botanical Garden, created in 1825. Located in the city centre, at the Leopoldstraat, it covers an area of almost 1 hectare.\nHarmonium Art museuM, a museum on pump organs in Klein-Willebroek\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (M HKA)\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\n\nAlthough Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former enceinte, only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. A replica of a castle named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais in the 19th century.\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:\n\n10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch\n12th and 13th century: canals (so called \"vlieten\" and \"ruien\") were made\n16th century: Spanish fortifications\n19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications\n20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\nThis is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.\n\n\n=== Minorities ===\nIn 2010, 36% to 39% of the inhabitants of Antwerp had a migrant background. A study projects that in 2020, 55% of the population will be of migrant background.\n\n\n==== Jewish community ====\n\nAfter The Holocaust and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic, live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff  (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk, based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Ger, Skver, Klausenburg, Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\n==== Jain community ====\n\nThe Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business. Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds. A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk).  Mr Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a full-fledged member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nThere are significant Armenian communities that reside in Antwerp, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with a smaller numbers are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church.\nOne of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel and involved in is the diamond trade business, that based primarily in the diamond district. Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nAccording to the American Association of Port Authorities, the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014\u20132020.  The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.\n\n\n=== Diamonds ===\nAntwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion. The city has four diamond bourses: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers. Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian and Maronite Christian from Lebanon and Armenian, traders become increasingly important.Antwerp World Diamond Centre, (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry. However, in recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nA six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to Brussels, Hasselt and Li\u00e8ge, Ghent, Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"Oosterweelconnection\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to Amsterdam and Paris, and national trains to Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Brussels, Charleroi, Hasselt, Li\u00e8ge, Leuven and Turnhout.\nAntwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald's haunting novel Austerlitz. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"premetro\" and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nA small airport, Antwerp International Airport, is located in the district of Deurne, with passenger service to various European destinations. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre.\nThe now defunct VLM Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport. This office is also CityJet's Antwerp office. When VG Airlines (Delsey Airlines) existed, its head office was located in the district of Merksem.Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport, is about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.\nThere is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs twice every hour on working days.\nThe runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.\nIn September 2019 Air Antwerp began operations with their first route to London City Airport with old VLM Airlines Fokker 50's.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections.\nThe current majority consists of N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld, led by mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA).\n\n\n=== Former mayors ===\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century important mayors include Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Nicolaas II Rockox.\nIn the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti\u00e8ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (New Flemish Alliance).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntwerp has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) similar to that of Southern England, while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) average highs for both July and August. Winters are more dominated by the maritime currents instead, with temps being heavily moderated.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAntwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its school of painting, which included Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the Teniers and many others.\n\nInformally, most Antverpians (in Dutch Antwerpenaren, people from Antwerp) speak Antverpian daily (in Dutch Antwerps), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other Brabantic dialects for its characteristic pronunciation of vowels: an 'aw' sound approximately like that in 'bore' is used for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the 'a' in 'hat'. The Echt Antwaarps Teater (\"Authentic Antverpian Theatre\") brings the dialect on stage.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nAntwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in the world. It has served as the learning centre for many Belgian fashion designers. Since the 1980s, several graduates of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts have become internationally successful fashion designers in Antwerp. The city has had a huge influence on other Belgian fashion designers such as Raf Simons, Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Theyskens and Kris Van Assche.\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nAntwerp is famous for its local products. In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally \"Antwerp Hands\". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.\n\n\n=== Missions to seafarers ===\nA number of Christian missions to seafarers are based in Antwerp, notably on the Itali\u00eblei. These include the Mission to Seafarers, British & International Sailors' Society, the Finnish Seamen's Mission, the Norwegian Sj\u00f8mannskirken and the Apostleship of the Sea. They provide cafeterias, cultural and social activities as well as religious services.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAntwerp is the home of the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC), founded in 1938 and located on the square Grote Markt since 1994.The band dEUS was formed in 1991 in Antwerp. dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material. Their musical influences range from folk and punk to jazz and progressive rock.\n\n\n=== Music festivals ===\nCultuurmarkt van Vlaanderen is a musical festival and a touristic attraction that takes place annually on the final Sunday of August in the city center of Antwerp. Where international and local musicians and actors, present their stage and street performances.Linkerwoofer is a pop-rock music festival located at the left bank of the Scheldt. This music festival starts in August and mostly local Belgian musicians play and perform in this event.Other popular festivals Fire Is Gold, and focuses more on urban music, and Summerfestival.\n\n\n=== World Choir Games ===\nThe city of Antwerp will co-host the 2020 World Choir Games together with the city of Ghent. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAntwerp held the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were the first games after the First World War and also the only ones to be held in Belgium. The road cycling events took place in the streets of the city.Royal Antwerp F.C., currently playing in the Belgian First Division, were founded in 1880 and is known as 'The Great Old' for being the first club registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1895. Since 1998, the club has taken Manchester United players on loan in an official partnership. Another club in the city was Beerschot VAC, founded in 1899 by former Royal Antwerp players. They played at the Olympisch Stadion, the main venue of the 1920 Olympics. Nowadays KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk plays at the Olympisch Stadion in the Belgian Second Division.\nThe Antwerp Giants play in Basketball League Belgium and Topvolley Antwerpen play in the Belgium men's volleyball League.\nFor the year 2013, Antwerp was awarded the title of European Capital of Sport.\nAntwerp hosted the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nAntwerp hosted the start of stage 3 of the 2015 Tour de France on 6 July 2015.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\nAntwerp has a university and several colleges. The University of Antwerp  (Universiteit Antwerpen) was established in 2003, following the merger of the RUCA, UFSIA and UIA institutes. Their roots go back to 1852. The University has approximately 23,000 registered students, making it the third-largest university in Flanders, as well as 1,800 foreign students. It has 7 faculties, spread over four campus locations in the city centre and in the south of the city.\nThe city has several colleges, including Antwerp Management School (AMS), Charlemagne University College (Karel de Grote Hogeschool), Plantin University College (Plantijn Hogeschool), and Artesis University College (Artesis Hogeschool). Artesis University College has about 8,600 students and 1,600 staff, and Charlemagne University College has about 10,000 students and 1,300 staff. Plantin University College has approximately 3,700 students.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nThe following places are twinned with or sister cities to Antwerp:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Born in Antwerp ===\n\n\n=== Lived in Antwerp ===\n\n\n== Select neighbourhoods ==\nDen Dam \u2013 an area in northern Antwerp\nThe diamond district \u2013 an area consisting of several square blocks, it is Antwerp's centre for the cutting, polishing, and trading of diamonds\nLinkeroever \u2013 Antwerp on the left bank of the Scheldt with a lot of apartment buildings\nMeir \u2013 Antwerp's largest shopping street\nVan Wesenbekestraat \u2013 the city's Chinatown\nHet Zuid \u2013 the south of Antwerp, notable for its museums and Expo grounds\nZurenborg \u2013 an area between Central and Berchem station with a concentration of Art Nouveau townhouses\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntwerp Book Fair\nAntwerp lace\nAntwerp Water Works (AWW)\nJewish Community of Antwerp\nLetterenhuis\nList of mayors of Antwerp\nPshevorsk \u2013 Hassidic Jewish movement based in Antwerp\nRoyal Antwerp F.C., local football club\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nBlanchard, Ian.

          "This attraction is a UNESCO world heritage, and it fully deserves it. The buildings surrounding the square, the statue in the middle explaining the city's name, all are just great!",

          "You're in the Grotemarkt, so Brabo is pretty difficult to miss. A nice piece of sculpture and a landmark of the area. There are two Irish pubs nearby, so once you've finished marveling at Brabo you can cool down with a pint of the black stuff.",
          "The statue is associated with a myth of a Roman soldier defeating a giant. It stands in Grote Markt and has a fountain. Although the statue is very symbolic to Antwerp, it is not an old one. It was sculptured in the 19th century. You will simply pass by it when you stroll in the",

        "wiki": "Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum (Dutch Beeldentuin Middelheim Museum) is a sculpture park of 30 acres in the park part of the Middelheim Nachtegalen Park at Antwerp.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1342, Middelheim is mentioned as a stede geheten Middelheim. Since the 16th century, it was used as a summer residence for rich merchants from Antwerp. In the 18th century, Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Gisbert van Schorel, Lord of Wilrijk brought an important art collection in the castle featuring notable artworks from Rubens and Van Dyck among others.\nThen, the estate was ceded to the Knight Parthon de Von where he wrote the Fables and dedicated himself to horticulture. In 1842, it was sold to the Le Grelle family, which sold it to the Antwerp municipality in 1910.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Middelheimmuseum park is known for its sculpture, which arose from the 'Biennale Middelheim', which was held in the park every two years since 1951. After twenty episodes of this sculpture exhibition in 1989 they decided to choose another way to supplement the image collection. The layout of the sculpture park has the shape of four fluttering strips on both sides of the Middelheimlaan, that cuts through the middle of the park.\nThe collection comprises two hundred images, including several dozen installed in the city of Antwerp. In addition, the Open Air Museum has hundreds of sculptures which are displayed through temporary exhibitions in the Braem Pavilion. In this pavilion fragile pieces are lined up that can not be place outdoors. The Burgemeester Lode Craeybeckx documentation centre of the sculpture park is located in the Orangerie of the Middelheimpark.\nIn 2012, the botanical garden Hortiflora with an area of 5 hectares was added to the existing sculpture park. This creates a natural connection to the Nachtegalen Park. On the side of the Hortiflora the architect Paul Robbrecht designed a new half open exhibition building called The House. This is a five meter high transparent semi volume with a clear geometry. In his own words the designer sees the building as an intimate building, populated with temporary residents. It wants to be a space that nurtures and protects. Not oversized, like most contemporary museums but on a human scale: A pavilion that makes possible a temporary one-to-one relationship with art. The planner has also outlined new lines into the existing landscape.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe collection includes works by many leading sculptors of modern and contemporary visual art, among others:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Beeldentuin Middelheim Museum at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "The Port of Antwerp is the port of the City of Antwerp. It is located in Flanders (Belgium), mainly in the province of Antwerp but also partially in the province of East Flanders. It is a seaport in the heart of Europe accessible to capesize ships. It is Europe\u2019s second-largest seaport, after Rotterdam. Antwerp stands at the upper end of the tidal estuary of the Scheldt. The estuary is navigable by ships of more than 100,000 Gross Tons as far as 80 km inland. Like Hamburg, the Port of Antwerp's inland location provides a more central location in Europe than the majority of North Sea ports. Antwerp's docks are connected to the hinterland by rail, road, and river and canal waterways. As a result, the port of Antwerp has become one of Europe's largest seaports, ranking second behind Rotterdam by total freight shipped. Its  international rankings vary from 11th to 20th (AAPA).\nIn 2012, the Port of Antwerp handled 14,220 sea trade ships (190.8 million tons of cargo, 53.6% in containers), 57,044 inland barges (123.2 million tons of cargo), and offered liner services to 800 different maritime destinations.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAntwerp's potential was recognized by Napoleon Bonaparte and he ordered the construction of Antwerp's first lock and dock in 1811. Called the Bonaparte Dock, it was joined by a second dock - called the Willem Dock after the Dutch King - in 1813. When the Belgian revolution broke out in 1830, there was a well-founded fear that the Dutch would blockade the Scheldt again but, in the event, they contented themselves with levying a stiff toll.\nFortunately, the young Belgium had friends in Britain and particularly in the person of Lord Palmerston, who believed the existence of Belgium would be beneficial to Britain, and that, in consequence, it was important to make sure that the newly born state was economically viable.\nWith his support, the Belgian government was able to redeem the Dutch Toll in 1863. By that time, the Kattendijk Dock had been completed in 1860 and the all important Iron Rhine Railway to the Ruhr had been finished in 1879. Antwerp then experienced a second golden age and by 1908 eight docks had been constructed. The opening of the Royers Lock, commenced in 1905, meant that ships drawing up to 31 feet (9.4 m) of water were able to enter the existing docks and access the new Lef\u00e8bvre and America docks.\nSuch was the situation at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. The British, and Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, in particular were well aware of the Port of Antwerp's strategic importance, so much so that Churchill arrived in Antwerp on 4 October 1914 to take charge of the defence of the city and its port.\nIn 1944 during the Second World War Allied forces liberated Antwerp on 4 September. The port and facilities were relatively undamaged and no major reconstruction work was required. However the port could not be used until 28 November, after the estuary approaches were cleared by the Battle of the Scheldt. Walcheren was the key that allowed use of the port, located further upstream on the right bank of the southern estuary of the river. Walcheren was attacked by Canadian and British forces and on 8 November all German resistance on the island had been overrun. An agreement assigned a large portion of the northern section of the port to the Americans and the southern section and the city of Antwerp to the British forces. The first US cargo vessel James B. Weaver arrived on 28 November 1944 with men of the 268th Port Company and their equipment on board. By mid-December the port was operating in high gear and, on average, some 9,000 civilians were employed by the Americans. Despite enemy air attacks, rockets and buzz bombs, operations were never entirely halted, although they were interrupted. In the first half year of 1945, the average amount of cargo discharged was around 0.5 million tons per month. After the close of the hostilities in Europe, the port was used for shipments of ammunition, vehicles, tanks and personnel to the Pacific. After the capitulation of Japan, shipments were directed to the United States. As from November 1945 the activities declined and by October 1946 all US Army operations ceased.\nWhen peace returned work started on the Grote Doorsteek, an ambitious plan which ultimately resulted in the extension of the docklands on the right bank of the Scheldt to the Dutch border. The construction of the Berendrecht Lock was the crowning element of this plan. It was the world's largest shipping lock when inaugurated in 1989. Since 1989, development has been concentrated on the creation of fast turnround tidal berths, both on the Right Bank (Europa Terminal and the North Sea Terminal) and on the Left Bank (Deurganck Dock).\n\n\n== Port lay-out ==\n\n\n=== The Right Bank ===\nWith the opening of the Berendrecht Lock (1989), a crowning achievement in developing the right bank dock complex was obtained. With a length of 500 m between the lock gates and a width of 68 m, the Berendrecht lock was the largest lock in the world when it was built (overtaken by the Kieldrecht lock on Antwerp's Left bank). This lock has a depth of 13.50 m, which makes the sill depth at mean high water equal to 17.75 m. Apart from the Lock, still further development of the right bank has been undertaken on the banks of the Scheldt outside the dock complex. Two large container terminals have been opened here. In 1990, the Europe terminal was operative, while secondly, the North Sea terminal became operative in 1997.\nThe older areas of the port, such as the Bonaparte dock, are being modernized as needs dictate to make them suitable for modern cargo handling operations. Among this modernisation, an upgrade of the Amerika dock, the Albert dock and the third harbour dock are being done to make them accessible to Panamax ships, which have a draught of 42 feet (13 m). Other modernisation projects being undertaken is the Bevrijdings dock(formerly known as the Delwaide dock), which will soon be able to serve the latest generation of container vessels. The Southern part of the Delwaide dock, used to be the MSC Home Terminal, a partnership between PSA Hesse-Noord Natie and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), before it moved to the newly built Deurganckdok on the left bank, to avoid passage through the locks. Due to a total quay length of more than 2 km, several ships can be handled at the same time. The MSC Home Terminal has an annual capacity of more than 3.6 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU).\n\n\n=== The Left Bank ===\nThe first plans for the development of the Waaslandhaven on Antwerp\u2019s left bank were prepared in the boom years of the 1960s. At that time, it was hoped that agreement could be reached with the Dutch on the construction of the Baalhoek Canal, which would have run from Kallo in Belgium through the Drowned Land of Saefthinge (on Dutch territory) into the Western Scheldt. This grand concept had the advantage that it would cut off the difficult bend known as the Bocht van Bath and facilitate access to deep draught ships.\nWork started on the Kallo Lock in 1979, and by the end of the 1980s the basic outlines of the Waaslandhaven were by and large complete. The main constituents are the Waasland Canal, the Verrebroek Dock, and the Vrasene Dock. The abandonment of the Baalhoek Canal project meant that an additional dock, known as the Doel Dock, would never be fitted out for shipping.\nThe development of the sites in the new docklands got off to a slow start, but took off in the 1990s. Nowadays, the trades handled in the Vrasene Dock include forest products, fruit juice, cars, plastic granulates, scrap and bulk gas.\nThe equipping of the Verrebroek Dock started in 1996 and saw the arrival of its first seagoing ship in 2000. When finalized, this dock will offer a total of 5 km of berths with a draught of 14.5 m.\n\n\n=== The Deurganck Dock ===\nSince the existing container terminals on the right bank of the Scheldt have reached their maximum capacity and the container freight volume keeps increasing (in 2007 it expanded by 8.2% to 8 million TEU), a new dock complex was constructed: the tidal Deurganck Dock, which is open to the river and which does not require vessels to pass through any lock. The first terminal in this dock was opened on July 6, 2005. The full capacity of the dock is estimated at more than 8 to 9 million TEU. The Deurganck dock has a wharf length of 5.5 km and consists of a total of 1,200,000 cubic metres of concrete. The Kieldrecht Lock, a new lock at the end of the Deurganckdock, giving access to the docks in the port area on the left bank opened in June 2016 and is the largest lock in the world. The lock is deeper than the Berendrecht Lock, the previous largest, in response to the trend towards ever-larger ships. The lock, which represents an investment of 340 million euros, is the second lock into the enclosed harbours and represents a failsafe feature; had the sole lock failed, any vessels inside would have been trapped, whereas it is highly improbable that both locks might simultaneously fail. On the landward side, facing the dock complex, the lock leads into the Waasland canal. From there the ships have easy access to all the other docks on the left bank: the Doel dock, the Verrebroek dock, the Vrasene dock and the North and South mooring docks. Since 2015, the north side of the dock is operated by the joint venture between MSC and PSA international, commonly referred to as MPET. The south side of the dock is operated by DP world, the terminal is known by the name 'Antwerp Gateway'.\n\n\n== Recent History ==\nIn October 2010, the port approved a long-term investment plan, worth 1.6 billion Euros over the next 15 years. The port would improve existing facilities, and acquire land from General Motors which is closing its Antwerp factory.\nUnlike the Port of Rotterdam, which has been able to expand westwards along the river Maas to Europoort and extend into the North Sea with Maasvlakte, Antwerp has little scope for further westward expansion. The northern (right bank) docks already reach the Dutch border, and on the left bank Belgium has a nuclear power plant downstream of the Deurganck dock.\nIn October 2019, the Port of Antwerp began using a hybrid tug that is powered by hydrogen and diesel.\n\n\n== Lillo Port Centre ==\nOn the east bank of the river Scheldt, but to the west of the main port area lies the old village of Lillo, where the Port of Antwerp has built a new visitor centre. Coach parties can arrive here, and (after a brief introduction and the donning of hard hats and hi-viz jackets) an official guide boards the coach and directs the party to visit places that would otherwise be prohibited under ISPS.In July, 2020, The total throughput of the Port of Antwerp fell by 4.9% in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFlanders Institute for Logistics (VIL)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Port of Antwerp at Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe port of Antwerp in pictures\nhttp://www.32cup.com/shipping/port-of-antwerp-the-current-situation",

          "The city in general is well worth a visit. From my arrival at the beautiful train station I was impressed. I then spent many hours wandering the city. I explored the outdoor shopping area, a few cafes, shopped in many of the artisan boutiques, and enjoyed a spectacular meal or",
          "We discovered the Antwerp Port Tours motor coach tour online while searching for some way to see the massive port during the winter months. We found the tour to be unique and really well-executed. The bus leaves at 1, 3, and 5pm, Wed. - Sun. from by the flags in front of the MAS",
          "The entire area of the old harbour district is stunning. One of the best many dining locations. Even spare ribs are a classic, with homemade BBQ jerk. Delicious! Antwerp is the worlwide top location for Belgium chocolate and pralinees and for the Jewish diamond trade with",
          "Our cruise ship was able to dock right in the town, so it was easy to get on and off at will. There was a lovely bridge and a castle in the distance",
          "We came from Namur on a WWI pilgrimage. Namur was an unexpected high point in our trip. The Engineer museum was astonishing! Vincent as our guide was wonderful! We will go back! Have to go back! Please can we import him for our trip. The museum is only open on a Wednesday but",
          "A port of call on our cruise, Antwerp's port is a short walk away from the main shopping area. The port is easy to manouvre - just watch out for the cyclists! We visited the main cathedral, which was just stunning, before heading off to sample Belgian Hot Chocolate and buy some",
          "We had a 3 hour cruise of the port of Antwerp, the second biggest in Europe after Rotterdam. It is slightly interesting in the first 30 minutes and then becomes quite dull. How many containers with bananas can you keep on spotting? It must be fantastic if you are fond of tankers",
          "It was just the first place I stayed in Europe. Oh Antwerp Port. It was magical, and a great economical site. There you're near to everything. Few steps forward and you will have everything you need. It's a great place for long walks, breath and relax, the scenic view is all",
          "I have visited the Port of Antwerp many time in business and by now it feels very much home. A very important European port which is to consider as a gateway out and in. Port of Antwerp is the third biggest port in Europe after Hamburg and Rotterdam and many important shipping",
          "We had a tour on the flandria boats around the port, impressive and interesting. You get a good idea of the activities and incredible business around If you have a little time, enjoye",
          "a nice place to take a walk with friends at sunset, windy though. Take a jacket along. Enjoy watching the population coming and going...just appreciate the time and the company.",
          "I enjoyed walking by the port, especially given my interest in shipping and the historical significance it represents here. I kinda walked by it quickly, and that's it. There isn't to much to do here, per se.",
          "The Port area at Antwerp is not a pretty place. The area looks like it has not been touched for many years. There is some works underway but it looks like it will be many years until this becomes an interesting place to visit.",
          "We walked to the port but you can also take public transport. The Museum Mas is an interesting building, moreover you can go up the escalators to reach the top floor with magnificient views of the city. Definitely well worth a visit.",
          "The our of the Port of Antwerp is really a great way to spend an afternoon. It was especially good for our family because we were accompanied by our friend and relative that used to work here. It was a beautiful sunny day and the harbour boat was very nice and clean.",
          "We took the train from Brussels and walked all over Antwerp. We covered miles but are fit so it wasn't a problem at all. We walked from the train station to the port going through the city center and enjoying all the old buildings and shops. The city is known for it's diamond",
          "Our tour was part of a canal tour, and it is huge. World War II in Europe was won from this port, as the Allies went across Europe most every thing needed came here. Know your History, it makes travel so much more fulfilling.",
          "my mum and I went on a cruise from Southampton to Antwerp it was a lovely few days and great places to visit to and we went on a tour bus which was very informative and had drinks and cake with a friend in a typical belguim tea room and when we departed the port a musical send",
          "During a city trip to Antwerp, we took 1 day to get acquainted with the antwerp port side. Absolutely worthwhile. Best thing to do, is to start of from the north of Antwerp center toward the region they call \"Eilandje\", and then enter the actual heart of the port from there.",
          "Not far away from Grote Markt. Not more than half an hour along the river. Very beautiful. The MAS museum building reminds Centre Pompidou in Paris. Watch open hours if you want visit the museum, but the building is open till late. Go to last flour to see a panoramic view of",
          "It's not a \"Port\" in the traditional sense - it's massive beyond anything I have seen before. On a morning we must have seen well over 100 lorries during the 10 minute walk to the bus stop. Cranes and ships everywhere interspersed with little cafes.",
          "Admiring the sunset there was superb! There are many restaurants and bars nearby, so great place to hang out in the evening!",
          "After having lunch you can walk on the kai along the river and have the best view. You find a lot of interesting buildings in a mix of old and modern belgian architecture",
          "The port of Antwerp is a quiet and historic worth the visit and walk by, either before or after the typical fine dining.",
          "It is different to say that you have done the port as it goes on for miles up towards the sea. However, the main part is around the Mas Museum, where there are lots of boats moored, including the beautiful Marjorie - a three masted schooner - unless she is out on a cruise.",
          "We visited the harbor with two couples. Because of time constraints we could not take a boat and we drove with the intention to see the succession of locks on the right bank, they have grown bigger and bigger by the years. We started with the tiny ones at Willem- and",
          "a bit overrated. good views and a port sense of open space but nothing more than that. Visit only if u have time",
          "Just happened to see that there was a 2 1/2 hour trip round the port available: some uncertainty over where the tickets were being sold from but so glad we persevered: it was fascinating. Spacious boat, with drinks available. Descriptions in 4 languages, including English, but",
          "I work there The first thing i do when i have visitor's from abroad my city is to give them a siteseeing tour of the port The port must be around 6 to 8 times bigger than the city itself. It's whole infrastructure is incredible and It has the biggest lock of the world Anyway",
          "Close to the old town the port is worth a look at. Cross the main road for a view of the river and any cruise ships that are in town, although only the smaller ones make it here. You can walk right next to them on a raised pathway.",
          "If you are at the port and the weather is nice, make sure you check out \"Bocadero\"! It is a city beach at the docklands. They created a sandy beach, put some sun beds, have a DJ playing electronical music all day and there's a bar that also serves tapas at certain timings.",
          "Bold building in the middle of an otherwise fairly understated old port area housing part free & part ticket exhibits. But even if you don't want to visit the exhibits the free trip to the top of this 8 ? storey building is a must for the views over Antwerp and its river.",
          "visiting bij \"linkeroever\", after walking trough the \"voetgangerstunnel\" you have a nice look at Antwerp and his port. Walking along the wather, you can discovver marvelous vieuw and places, ols shipping hangars, etc. At \"rechteroever\" you can visit the realy workin ghabour by",
          "It's not so beautiful at rechteroever but linkeroever is very good! Go under the water by metro or you can also walk in voetgangerstunnel. The best at the port is you can sit at the water and it's very when the weather is good! at the water you have free parking! In the winter",
          "All nice things can be visited by using public transport or just by a full day walk. Public transport is easy to use and rather cheap.",
          "Oh boy, what a delight! We woke up, opened our curtains and the window was full of a view of Antwerp cathedral. We had decided not to head of to Bruges and were so glad that we stayed in Antwerp. There where lots of small Christmas markets, brightly lit trees, squares all decked",
          "Yes, Antwerp has one of the busiest ports in Europe, but there's not much to see as a tourist. The real commercial harbour has long ago left the city and moved north about 20km. The harbour in the city itself is deserted.",
          "Close to the port there is a nice Castle and some goods restaurants. It's nice to visiti the port but nothing special.",
          "The port was very nice and displayed some historic points that we weren't aware of from World War II. There was a long boardwalk to go down and take pictures. An old castle type building was right there as well to go through.",
          "Well worth getting a guided tour around the old port and a view off the MAS museum. Get a great view across the new ports and into the Netherlands",
          "I took a boat trip on with Flandria boats - 2.5 - 3 hours long. It was really interesting, and a guide spoke to the guests on board in about 6 languages about what we were seeing. The hot cup of coffee on board is a welcome relief from the cold outside, but outside is where",
          "We too a 3 hour boat trip around the docks and found it very interesting. There was a bar on board which also served hot drinks. The captain gave a very good commentary in 3 languages, which was very informative. We thought the whole thing was very good value and the beer was",
          "You can visit the impressive port of Antwerp by boat. A tour can take between 3 to 5 hours and while there are quite a lot of nice views its mostly the history that brings it alive. All the boats have a bar so you can lean back and relax and listen to the guide. A nice way to",
          "I had a great day going to the MAS (museum) which is in the port area. The port area is one of the next new places for restaurants, bars, dance, and is great to walk around especially since the port is a very important part of Antwerp's past and future.",
          "Well worth the 2.5 hour cruise during which one sees the different docks in the Antwerp Port. Guide made the tour interesting and informative.",
          "The Port Of Antwerp is really impressionant! The tours organised by the boat company Flandria are good but also interesting is a tour with the people of the Port's Center (Havencentrum) in Lillo a small village in the middle of the port. The drive around with you and show you",
          "Great to see ships come and go. If you like some ship spotting, I know some nice places where you can go.",
          "We went on the Flandia line harbour cruise for over 3 hours. The harbour is enormous, and there are some really big ships to look at. The container ships are the most exciting, but you can also see coal and salt being loaded, and a oil refinery. The harbour trip involves",
          "The flandria boats give a tour in the harbor. The harbor itself is not nice to see, but as with any world port it is amazing. The flandria boats give you a nice time and good view of the industry.",
          "a lot of activity is going on in Antwerp's Port as it is one of the largest ones in the world. We did a trip by car and had an excursion by boot We ate in \"spek en eieren\" (bacon and eggs) and enjoyed the place aswell as the people",
          "Thanx to port management. they gave all the details. Not boring at all even u may not be into ports or containers. It makes u understand why antwerp is a trade city",
          "The best way to visit the port of antwerp is by boat. You can book a tour nearby at Flandria for a guided tour in the port of Antwerp for 50 minutes (short tour) for only around 10\u20ac. It gives you a small impression of the old harbour fading into the modern harbour and the pretty",
          "Antwerp Port has the largest land area of any port in the world. Other than a world class port they have villages in the port area. Some fantastic restaurants and the MAS Museum which brings the people of Antwerp closer to the Port. A pleasure just to walk or cycle in the port",
          "Antwerp Port is one of the largest in the wsorld, and has some surprises, including nature reserves where birds of all sorts stay and bread. I did not know that; on top of that is offers some great cycling routes, and is quiet during the weekend... Visit LILLO, the smallest",
          "You can enjoy nice views from the promenade deck at the Antwerp port and you can also make boatrips in the harbour area which are interesting",
          "As far as medievil city goes Antwerpen (Antwerp for non flemish) is quite a nice port town. Unpretentious, and easy to navigate, the old city is filled with history and the Old Castle, is an example of a real (not petty) working castle to servein defence of the city in a bygone",
          "This has so uch history built into the walls (and river). A great place to take a strole and look at the liners if any are in port. However, it can become deserted in the evenings and a hangout for young people drinking.",
          "The port is what made Antwerp great ! So have a visiting tour with for example a Flandria boat and relax while looking at the activity alongside the port.",
          "the best way to visit it is on bike, but if you cannot : take public transport : check the website of De Lijn, buy an inexpensive ticket and gawk. or spend some more money and take the boat : Flandria is offering several possibliities",
          "I really like the port (I like ports) but it's probably better not to go there at night since some parts are quite lonely then. However in the streets close to the port (the 'Kaaien') there are some nice restaurants and it's not far from the centre of town. I really love the",
          "We came in on a Fred Olsen cruise and you can walk to everything from the port -- its a great base location for touring Antwerp! Plus its in a very safe area! You should feel comfortable walking around here at any time of day!",
          "Is one the biggest in the whole world! We really liked it! deserve to go!",
          "The Antwerp Soho. You can see the MAS building with incredibly views of the city. Antiques shops and nice walk."

          "I'm less familiar with graphic art and really enjoyed the visual story of Goya, Munch and Rops and their artistic performances. The other artists in the collection rightly contribute to this story. Museum de Reede is a nice place to be and radiates style, unity and care. A visit",

        "wiki": "Turnhout (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8t\u028frn\u0266\u028cut]) is a Belgian municipality located in the Flemish province of Antwerp. The municipality comprises only the city of Turnhout proper. On January 1, 2015, Turnhout had a total population of 42,637. The total area is 56.06 km2 (21.64 sq mi) which gives a population density of 835.5 835.5/km2 (2,164/sq mi). The agglomeration, however, is much larger, accounting up to 81,473 inhabitants.\nTurnhout is known for its playing card industry, as it houses the head office of the world's largest manufacturer of playing cards, Cartamundi. Turnhout is also the capital of the administrative district with the same name. The Turnhout city council often promotes the city as \"the capital of the Kempen area\". This designation is entirely unofficial, since the Kempen area is far larger than the Turnhout district and does not form an administrative unit.\nTurnhout serves as the economic and cultural center for other communities in the immediate vicinity with more than 40 schools. There is also an important services sector with two hospitals, a two-stage theatre, an eight-screen cinema and one of the largest cultural centres of Belgium.\nTurnhout is located at about 51.3 North and 4.9 East, 42 km (26 mi) from the centre of Antwerp, 30 km (19 mi) from Breda and Tilburg, 40 km (25 mi) from Eindhoven. The football club of the city is K.V. Turnhout.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurnhout originated on the crossroads of two major trade routes and in the protection of the hunting castle of the Dukes of Brabant that seems to have existed since 1110 or earlier. This hunting past is still reflected in the city's coat of arms. The small community that developed obtained its Libertas as a \"free city\" from Henry I, Duke of Brabant in about 1212. In 1338, the privilege of organizing a market on Saturday was granted, a tradition that still holds today. In 1466, a traveler described the well-built houses and paved roads, and counted five churches.\n\nBy the 16th century, Turnhout had become a wealthy commercial center. Unfortunately, the end of the century brought war, fire, confiscations and epidemics. Suppression and inquisition made many progressive citizens  to take refuge in the Dutch Republic, leaving the land of Turnhout impoverished. The further history of Turnhout consists of a series of ups and downs. Many times, the city and surroundings were the playground of armies, resulting in two major battles named after Turnhout: one in 1597 and one in 1789 are referred to as Battle of Turnhout.\nIn 1830, Belgium became independent, and Turnhout fell just south of the new border with the Netherlands. The period of peace between 1831 and 1914 saw the digging of the canal (1846) and the construction of the railroad (1855).\nIn the late Middle Ages, Turnhout was a well-known center for the weaving of bedding articles and of the linen trade. At the start of the 19th century, these trades were replaced by industries based on the use of paper. Pieter Corbeels and Philippus Jacobus Brepols are considered to be the founders of this industry. Turnhout retains much of this industry today. Numerous graphics companies are located in the region, such as Brepols, Group Joos, Proost International Book Production, Van Genechten Packaging, and last but not least Cartamundi, the world market leader of the playing card industry. In addition, the Belgian Centre for the Graphics Industry, and the Flemish Innovation Center for Graphic Communication (Campus Blairon) are located in Turnhout. Soudal, whose headquarters is located in Turnhout, is one of the leading companies in sealants.\n\n\n=== Postal history ===\nThe Turnhout post office opened before 1830. It used postal code 122 with bars (before 1864), and 367 with points before 1874.Postal code since 1969: 2300.\n\n\n== Sights ==\nArchitectural sights worth visiting are the 12th century castle of the Dukes of Brabant, the Gothic church of St. Peter, the beguinage (begijnhof) dating from the 13th century, the 14th century Gothic chapel of Theobald and the Taxandria museum housed in a prestigious Renaissance mansion. Of particular interest is the Museum of the Playing Card. This is located in an old factory building downtown and houses a beautifully restored steam engine.\nThe beguinage was recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1998.\n\n\n== Events ==\nTurnhout is host to the biannual comic festival Strip Turnhout, the oldest comic festival of Flanders, and one of the largest.\nEvery year, there is also the film festival MOOOV (the former Open Doek) which promotes cultural movies.\nDuring the summer months, the \"Vrij-dagen\" are organised. For a certain period, every Friday (vrijdag in Dutch) two artists or bands give a live performance. The event is completely free (vrij in Dutch) and attracts large crowds, strongly benefitting the local economy. Due to budgetary issues however, the \"Vrij-dagen\" have been discontinued since 2009, when the last edition was held.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nMarc de Bonte (born 1990), kickboxer\nPhilippus Jacobus Brepols, founder of Brepols\nSven Breugelmans (born 1979) motocross world champion\nPieter Corbeels, printer and a leader of the Boerenkrijg\nFilip Daems, footballer (born 1978)\nBart Dockx, professional cyclist for UCI ProTeam Predictor-Lotto\nDidier de Chaffoy de Courcelles (born 1953), scientist and businessman\nFran\u00e7ois du Four, printer and mayor.\nPaul Geerts, comics artist, successor of Willy Vandersteen as artist and author for the Spike and Suzy comics (born 1937)\nJoris Hendrickx, 2009 Sidecarcross world champion\nConstant Janssen, father of Paul Janssen and founder of the N.V.

        "wiki": "Antwerp was developed as a fortified city, but very little remains of the 10th century enceinte. Only some remains of the first city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht, and a replica of a burg (castle) named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais during the 19th century. Parts of the canals that protected the city between the 12th and 16th century have been covered and used as a sewage system. Both the 16th century city walls and the 19th century fortifications have been covered up by major infrastructure works during the 19th and 20th century.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in six phases:\n\nFirst fortification 980 AD: first fortified wall and ditch, improved around 1100\nSecond fortification 12th century: first vlieten and ruien (city canals) were dug\nExpanded second fortification during 13th and 14th century:\nexpansion to the north with more ruien\nexpansion to the south with vesten\nThird fortification before the 16th century: on the south and east side of the city\nFourth fortification, 16th century: construction of the Spanish fortifications\nFifth fortification, early 19th century: construction of a 1st ring of Brialmont fortresses about 10 km from the original burg\nSixth fortification, 19th century after the independence of Belgium: construction of a 2nd ring of Brialmont fortresses about 20 km from the original burgFrom the 18th century major works and construction projects have changed the nature of the original innercity canals, and in the 19th and 20th century the projects for the development of the port have destroyed all visible signs of the fortification works and made the canals disappear from view.\nSome of the fortifications are still being used as military installations.\n\n\n== First fortification ca. 10th century AD ==\n\nSince the Treaty of Verdun (843) the river Scheldt was the natural and political border between the County of Flanders (belonging to the Kingdom of France) to the west and the German Empire. In 980 the German Emperor Otto II awarded Antwerp a margraviate, and ordered a fortification built on the wharf, part of his fortification program for his western border. Around 1106 the Counts of Leuven, the later Dukes of Brabant, acquired the Margraviate of Antwerp, and it continued to be part of the Duchy of Brabant until the end of the Ancien R\u00e9gime.The first fortification consisted of a wall and ditch surrounding an enceinte built partly on the wharf. The wall was about 5 metres (16 ft) high and 1.35 metres (4.4 ft) thick and the ditch (on the north and southside of the fortification wall) was about 5 metres (16 ft)-10 metres (33 ft) wide. The ditch wa located at the north and eastside at the current location of the  street called Burchtgracht (a name that translates literally into \"fortress ditch\"), in the south it was at the Palingbrug. In 1104 Emperor Hendrik IV reinforced the walls to 12 metres (39 ft) high and 2 metres (6.6 ft) thick. The remnants of this wall can still be seen near the west face of the Vleeshuis at the end of the Vleeehuisstraat\" .\nThe wharf was a dry landmass, a dry hill protruding about 30 m into the main track of the river Scheldt (measured from the current 19th-century Scheldt-quayside). The enceinte within the wall was about 2.5 hectares (270,000 sq ft) in size, and contained 3 streets: the old Steenstraat (the current ramp leading to the het Steen building), the Zakstraat and the Mattestraat, and there was a square : the Burgplein. The rivershore sloped steeply into the river at the south and west of the wharf and more gently at the northside (the quays in the drawings to the right were constructed at a later date). On the westside there was only a fortification wall (no ditch) facing the river with a tollhouse at the wharfgate.  Within the enceinte the most important buildings were:\n\nhouse het Steen, (part of the current monument),\nhouse het hof van Cruyninghe (the Margrave's residence),\nthe church dedicated to St Walburga, (which has entirely disappeared)\nthe Vierschaer (the tribunal)\na refuge of the Affligem Abbey\na brewery.During recent excavations behind the Vleeshuis on the intersection of the current Vleeshuisstraat and Burchtgracht, the remainder of the medieval wall structure was excavated and also the floor of the cellar of house De Gans (The Goose, an inn) and a well. Another part of the fortification wall that had been enclosed in the old \"badhuis\" building (formerly the public baths) was made visible again when that building was demolished (a new structure has been built on the badhuis site, but the remainder of the medieval fortification wall is now better preserved, see gallery).\n\n\n== Before the 13th century ==\nThe city developed quickly outside its initial fortification, and by 1200 it had quadrupled in surface. Because trade had become the main activity of the city, canals were dug around its extremities, to allow barges to bring cargo into the city to and from the ships moored at the wharf. Those canals were called ruien . The canals flooded at high tide and emptied at low tide. The canals that connected with the main river Scheldt were called vliet\nInitially the barges moored in the early canals would come to rest on the muddy bottom making cargo handling nearly impossible. So at certain places attempts were made to build wooden jetties and stone fortified quays to replace the sloping embankments of the canals such that barges could be moored alongside and be discharged and loaded even if the canal was empty of river water.\nThe canals were considered the second fortification of Antwerp. The triangle of canals (ruiendriehoek) enclosed about 20 hectares (2,200,000 sq ft). All of the ruien and vlieten of the ruiendriehoek heve been covered and served as the city sewage system, the system is open for visits by tourists. The current street names still remind of the \"rui\", \"vliet\" below it and the \"brug\" (bridge) reminded of bridges allowing access to the city. \nThe ruiendriehoek  consisted of following streets : \n\nKoolkaai is the remainder of the Holenvliet\" or \"Kolenvliet\" which was covered in the 13th century where charcaol would come to the city,\nKoepoortbrug is the first visual remainder of the first canal system, through the Koepoortbridge and citygate cattle would be brought to the nearby cattlemarket (Veemarkt) where it was bought by the butchers; the cattle went directly to the Vleeshuis (which was a nearly industrial slaughterhouse in that era).\nMinderbroedersrui is over the actual location of this pre 13th century canal, and refers to the order of the Minderbroeders (Order of Friars Minor)\nWijngaardbrug was the most eastern corner of the city (at the end of the current Wolstraat),\nJezu\u00eftenrui is partly on the map but is not aligned with the old canal, the canal runs in a fairly straight line form the Wijngaardbrug under the Saint Carolus Borromeus church towards the Melkmarkt,\nReinoldsbrug (current Melkmarkt) has disappeared but would have been at the intersection of the Melkmarkt and Korte Nieuwstraat\nKaasrui was moved north to its current location, but runs in a fairly straight line to the Suikerrui\nalso the Broodbrug has disappeared currently the intersection of Suikerrui and 'Hoogstraat\nSuikerrui is not on top but on the south embankment of its covered namesake\nBotervliet was the most southern canal but it has disappeared completely with the 19th century works on the waterfront.\n\n\n== During the 13th century ==\nHowever, buildings would soon be constructed on the outside of the ruien, and as trade increased two expansions occurred during the 13th century.\nBefore 1250 an extension of the ruien was dug to the south. The canals were named vliet (connected to the Scheldt and vest.\nthe St Cathelijnevest, connected at the Wijngardbridge to the Jezuitenrui  and the Minderbroedersrui,\nanother vest (name lost, but suspected Huidevettersvest) at the current trace of the Wiegstraat\nand then right back to the Scheldt Lombardenvest\nSt Jansvliet.To the north the Dominican order decided to build a monastery, the \"Predikherenklooster\". The Holenrui was filled up again, which meant there was no waterpassage between the end of the Kool- or Kolenvliet (a current street, name Koolkaai) and the Minderbroedersui and Koepoortbridge.  In order to create a passage to the Minderbroedersrui 3 new canals were dug around the monastery, the Verversrui, Falconrui and one of which the name has disappeared from the maps. North of the Koolrui a new access canal was dug between the Scheldt and the Verversrui: the St Pietersvliet.\nAt the end of the 13th century (1295) John II, Duke of Brabant decided to create new fortifications, which made the city grow to 156 hectares (0.60 sq mi). He started in the south incorporating the St Michielsadbij that had been built south of the St Jansvliet) inside the fortifications, and built the Kronenburg-tower on the river bank. The fortification went in a nearly straight line  east to the Bluetower (currently Blauwtorenplein) where the fortification went north through the Wapper (where Rubens had his residence and atelier) and Cauwenberg right up to the Paardenmarkt (horse market) where it joined the north fortification of the Falconrui.\n\n\n== 16th century ==\n\nThe 16th century \"Spanish fortifications\" and the old citadel defended by General Chass\u00e9 in 1832, have totally vanished. Modern Antwerp's broad city-center boulevard (Italielei, Frankrijklei, Britselei and Amerikalei) marks the position of the original (second) Spanish fortifications.\n\n\n== 19th century ==\nAt the time of the establishment of Belgian independence, Antwerp was defended by the citadel and an enceinte around the city. In 1859, seventeen of the twenty-two fortresses constructed under Wellington's supervision in 1815\u20131818 were dismantled and the old citadel and enceinte were removed. A new enceinte 8 miles (13 km) long was constructed, and the villages of Berchem and Borgerhout, now boroughs of Antwerp, were absorbed within the city.\nThis enceinte is protected by a broad wet ditch, and in the caponiers are the magazines and store chambers of the fortress. The enceinte has nineteen openings or gateways, but of these seven are not used by the public. As soon as the enceinte was finished, eight detached forts from 2 to 2.5 miles (3.2 to 4.0 kilometres) from the enceinte were constructed. They begin in the north near Wijnegem and the zone of inundation, and terminate in the south at Hoboken. In 1870 Fort Merksem and the redoubts of Berendrecht and Oorderen were built for the defence of the area to be inundated north of Antwerp.\nIn the 1870s, the fortifications of Antwerp were deemed to be out of date, given the increased range and power of artillery and explosives. Antwerp was transformed into a fortified position by constructing an outer line of forts and batteries 6 to 9 miles (14 km) from the enceinte.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDe Stad Antwerpen van de romeinse tijd tot de 17de eeuw , Topografische studie rond het plan van Virgilius Bononiensis 1565; Authors: Voet, Asaert, Soly, Verhulst, De Nave & Van Roey; 1978; Publisher: Gemeentekrediet van Belgie, Brussels.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "If you are a germ freak, do not visit this place. So my brother wanted to visit because in the website it looked so cool and beautiful. They gave us boots, coveralls, backpack to put everything in, and ipad and headphones. It took about 90 minutes from putting on everything till",
          "I went to De Ruien with my boyfriend because looking on the website it looked so interesting. When we went to get the boat tour, the woman on the desk seemed annoyed and stated it was not running because of \u201ctechnical problems\u201d (despite this not being displayed online or in",
          "I found this a very interesting attraction, which was really well organised. My only complaint was to do with the language used. The speech was perfectly given in 3 languages by the lady upstairs, we had earphones which were really not needed as the iPad we were given to work",

          "Wanted to do something a bit different while in Antwerp and a sewer tour popped up. Turned up to do the 2 hour tour of the sewers and it was fully booked, we should have booked in advance. Who knew sewers were so popular. We were offered the 15 minute boat ride up and down one",
          "First off all, its not dangerous, filty or as hazardous as a view reviews below. Simply because there isn\u2019t any sewerstuff floating thru De Ruien anymore, that is all contained in sewerpipes which are located inside. The water you encouter is streetwater. This said, you do have",

          "This tour is not for everyone. It stinks. It\u2019s dark. The tablet tour guide videos are hard to understand in English. That said, I love any kind of underground adventure and I thought it was great. Don\u2019t bring any luggage or bags, as you put on tyvek overalls and carry only",
          "This is a literal trip into the bowels of the city. It was not at all as advertised on the website. Imagine spending two hours slogging through puddles of ancient and modern toxic waste, surrounded by trails of toilet paper, rats and spiders, all while breathing in toxic mold",
          "Interesting tour, but many negatives! Tour desk wouldn\u2019t accept MasterCard or Visa! Maximum number of people on \u201cself-guided\u201d tour is 15, so we had to wait a few hours...Tour quite interesting but everything in Dutch! Tablet had English option but speaking still in Dutch with",

          "There are 15, 90, and 120 minute options. Luckily picked up the 15 minute boat option. The smell is overwhelming and almost makes you vomit. The commentary was short and the tour consisted of the boat moving in a straight line for about 10 minutes, with the rest of the time",
          "Waiting for the boat ride took longer than the ride itself. It is just a ride between two spots with nothing interesting to look at. If you know what a sewer looks like, then skip out on this waste of money. It also smells like, you guessed it, a sewer. The commentary is",
          "We went on the short boat tour. It was cheap and quite impressive. You went on a short boat tour though a very cool lit sewer getting some information when you were on it. Afterwards I wished I had gone on the longer walking tour as well but I didn't have time this trip.",

          "Read about this in Trip Advisor and booked a tour right away. This was such a unique experience. The tablets weer a huge help. They said the tour was in English, but that's not exactly true. The tablets that you read from can be set to English but the guide we had did not speak",

          "Sadly, the guided walk was fully booked, so we could only do the 15min boat tour. This left us hungry for more and for sure we will come back for the whole experience! The 15mins in the boat were great, so much more interesting and beautiful than expected!",
          "Guide was brilliant, although his English was sometimes difficult to understand (much better than my non existent Dutch though!). Make sure you take ID with you as they require it for the full tour.",
          "We just wanted to do something cultural since we have been bar hopping and learning nothing. We decided to visit this place. Totally different scenery and almost like a spooky ride. I enjoyed the cold moist air and didn't mind the smell. Good and interesting tour guide. This is",

          "Did the visit with my son of 10 which is the minimum age. I am originally of Antwerp but never had the chance to the tour. It was great to experience a different way of learning the history of Antwerp. As the walk provides you with a tablet that holds 4 languages (Dutch,",
          "The best thing I did in the city! So much fun. After a short intro, we were given our coveralls and boots (know your European shoe size and wear/have socks). Then we got tablets that have 4 language options including English. We boarded a boat for a short 3 min ride and then",
          "Antwerp once had a network of canals that ran throughout the city. Over time, these canals became filthy open sewers, so the city encouraged residents to build over the canals, eventually encasing them all underground. This is still a part of Antwerp's storm sewer system, but",
          "If you are in Antwerp do visit De Ruien at Suikerrui 25. Make a reservation and discover the old sewer system from the MA. You get boots and a suite for protection. Then your journey under the old city starts. The walk is about 1.2 km and shows vaults, spiders and rats. You can",
          "This is definitively an off-the-beaten-path attraction. A guide takes you first on a short boat trip back-and-forth towards the Schelde river. After that you walk in De Ruien, the canals of Antwerp that Napoleon ordered to be roofed over to contain the smell. And indeed the",
          "I went on this tour with my cousin and both our mums. We joined a group which so happened to be all girls so we made for a 100% female visitors tour which apparently is quite uncommon at this place :) Anyway the tour... Was cool. We did the tablet guided version. When you",
          "I just finished this tour and it was wonderful! The guide was great, the audio guide on the tablet was great as well. Very cool way to learn about the history of Antwerp!",
          "It takes about 15 minutes to climb in the boat, take the tour and leave the boat again. It is nice to have a glimp of what`s beneath streetlevel, but it is just not good enough.",
          "The highlight of the weekend, if that's not a contradiction for something underground. A fantastic experience and a very personable guide.",
          "You can follow the ruien under the ground in Antwerp. It smells, is dirty and wet but it was nice to hear the history of it and to visit.",
          "we were just walking past and decided to pop in to see if we could book. They were very accommodating as we explained that we only had a short amount of time. It was interesting and a must to while you are in Antwerp",
          "Nice to do this activity, won't say that when on citytrip maybe, but a guided tour underground, different languages on tablet, time flew and nice and friendly personel",
          "This is just a comment that the underground museum/drains looked really interesting but sadly tours were not available for non native speakers. Hope to have an opportunity for an English language (or even French) tour in the future",
          "If you want to do something special in Antwerp city ... this walk through the underground waterways of Antwerp is special. The guide will tell you a lot of stories about the history of this city. Take 4 hours for this visit!",
          "Good fun for the afternoon. You report early afternoon, get protective clothing and boots on and down you go in unused sewers. And it's awesome! It is very very informative, all sorts of quirky stories and at the end of the tour you're taken round the same route where you were",
          "Walk through the underground waterways of Antwerp. And listen to the guide who will tell you some history. A \"rui\" is a natural waterway that has been covered by arches of bricks in the middle ages. The tour starts with a short boattrip. Halfway the tour you will return to"

        "wiki": "Viktor & Rolf is a fashion house which specialises in creating conceptual and avant-garde designs. It was founded in 1993 by Dutch designers Viktor Horsting (born 1969, Geldrop) and Rolf Snoeren (born 1969, Dongen). For more than twenty years Viktor & Rolf have sought to challenge preconceptions of fashion, and bridge the divide between fashion and art. Viktor & Rolf have designed both haute couture and ready-to-wear collections. The duo is renowned for their avant-garde designs, which rely heavily on theatrical and performative fashion runways.\n\n\n== Background ==\nViktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren first met while studying at the Arnhem Academy of Art and Design in 1989.  Upon graduation in 1992, the pair began working together and relocated to Paris. Initially, Viktor & Rolf were shunned by the fashion industry, however, the designers were received well by the art world. Subsequently, art institutions such as the Groninger Museum began to acquire garments from the designers.\nInitial collections established the extravagant silhouettes, witty use of materials and irreverent concepts the designers would come to be known for. In 2000, Viktor & Rolf launched their company logo of a wax seal bearing the monogram V&R, and began to devote their artistic talent to ready-to-wear collections.   In 2003, the designers launched a Menswear collection which co-existed alongside the women\u2019s line until 2009.  Additionally, Viktor & Rolf created perfumes: the female fragrance Flowerbomb (2004) and the male fragrance Antidote (2006).  In 2015, the designers halted ready-to-wear production and returned once more to haute couture citing that they wanted to \"explore the limits of wearability, function and form.\"\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe fashion company has created both ready-to-wear and haute couture fashion collections. Below is a comprehensive anthology of all Viktor and Rolf collections.\nEarly haute couture collections\n\nHyeres (1993)\nL\u2019Hiver de l\u2019Amour (1995)\nL\u2019Apparence du Vide (1995)\nLaunch (1996)\nFirst Couture (Spring/Summer 1998)\nAtomic Bomb (Autumn/Winter 1998-99)\nBlack Light (Spring/Summer 1999)\nRussian Doll (Autumn/Winter 1999-00)\nBells (Autumn/Winter 2000-01)Ready-to-wear \n\nStars & Stripes (Autumn/Winter 2000-01)\nThere\u2019s no Business Like Show Business (Spring/Summer 2001)\nBlack Hole (Autumn/Winter 2001-02) (Content warning: blackface)\nWhite (Spring/Summer 2002)\nLove Live the Immaterial (Bluescreen) (Autumn/Winter 2002-03)\nFlowers (Spring/Summer 2003)\nOne Woman Show (Autumn/Winter 2003-04)\n\u2018Monsieur\u2019 (Autumn/Winter 2003-4)\nThe Red Shoes (Spring/Summer 2004)\nThe Hunt (Autumn/Winter 2004-05)\n\u2018Monsieur\u2019 (Autumn/Winter 2004-05)\nFlowerbomb (Spring/Summer 2005)\n\u2018Monsieur\u2019 (Spring/Summer 2005)\nBedtime Story (Autumn/Winter 2005-06)\n\u2018Monsieur\u2019 (Autumn/Winter 2005-06)\nUpside Down (Spring/Summer 2006)\n\u2018Monsieur\u2019 (Spring/Summer 2006)\nSilver (Autumn/Winter 2006-07)\n\u2018Monsieur\u2019 (Autumn/Winter 2006-07)\nBallroom (Spring/Summer 2007)\n\u2018Monsieur\u2019 (Spring/Summer 2007)\nThe Fashion Show (Autumn/Winter 2007-08)\n\u2018Monsieur\u2019 (Autumn/Winter 2007-08)\nHarlequin (Spring/Summer 2008)\n\u2018Monsieur\u2019 (Spring/Summer 2008)\nNO (Autumn/Winter 2008-09)\n\u2018Monsieur\u2019 (Autumn 2008)\n\u2018Monsieur\u2019 (Spring 2009)\nShalom (Spring/Summer 2009)\nCutting Edge Couture (Spring/Summer 2010)\nGlamour Factory (Autumn/Winter 2010-11)\n\n\n== Return to haute couture ==\nAfter a thirteen-year hiatus from creating haute couture, Viktor & Rolf re-established themselves as with the Zen Garden (Autumn/Winter 2013-14) collection. Below are small summaries of Viktor & Rolf\u2019s most recent haute couture designs.\nBonbon (Spring/Summer 2014)\nInterested in exploring the point at which skin and clothing meet, Viktor & Rolf created a collection of latex couture pieces titled Bonbon. The fluid materiality of latex (not commonly used in high fashion) juxtaposed with the light colour palette resulted in an almost ethereal and angelic collection. The pieces were created seamlessly and designed to appear as a second skin. To depict an illusion of depth stylistic birds, bows and ribbons were hand painted onto the latex, in a trompe-l'\u0153il technique. The Bonbon collection was modelled by ballerinas en-pointe.\nRed Carpet Dressing (Autumn/Winter 2014-15)\nDescribed as a \"surrealist commentary,\" Viktor & Rolf's collection Red Carpet Dressing explored the reciprocal relationship between celebrity and designer.  The duo humorously exploited the concept of dressing for the red carpet by designing 22 couture gowns from red carpet. Elegant high fashion pieces were made from unassuming rough and rigid carpet.  The designs incorporated animal skin patterns made from the same material and sewn onto the base. The monochromatic palette gave primary focus to the design and pattern making techniques, which recalled primitive knotted constructions and classic couture styles. Viktor & Rolf again used the haute couture platform to comment on the fashion industry and contemporary culture.\nVan Gogh Girls (Spring/Summer 2015)\nThe ideas of momentum and growth were of central importance in the 2015 haute couture collection. To visualise the central concept, Viktor & Rolf adopted the quintessential summer outfit of a floral sundress, flip flops and a straw dress, and transformed the imagery into three-dimensional sculptural pieces. The collection escalated from a simplistic baby doll silhouette into extravagant couture pieces. Floral outlines evolved into three-dimensional fabric flowers, as simple straw hats extended laterally to connect with the pleated dresses. The evocative colours and black graphic outlines present throughout the garment collection were reminiscent of Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, of whom the collection was aptly named after. Van Gogh Girls is not only an exercise in exaggerating forms and imagery, but additionally showcased the close relationship between artists and fashion designers.\nWearable Art (Autumn/Winter 2015-16)\nThe fluid link between art and fashion was perhaps most clearly portrayed with the Wearable Art haute couture collection. Twenty models, dressed in simple denim artist's smocks, walked the runway draped in what appeared to be oil paintings. Designed to mimic the imagery of classical paintings with gilded frames, the garments included cloaks, dresses and skirts. Through painterly illusion and construction, Viktor & Rolf transformed framed paintings into haute couture garments, and then back to paintings. During the display, the designers removed five of the garments from the models and hung them back on a white wall. The collection provoked public conversation as to the definition of art mediums.\nVagabonds (Autumn/Winter 2016-17)\nVagabonds entwined recycling with haute couture. Focused on conscious designing, Viktor & Rolf manifested a collection made entirely from discarded materials from their atelier.  Strips of fabric were braided, offshoots of tulle were sewn together, and buttons were clustered as embellishment. Overall the garments expressed the artistic possibilities of recycling. The collection was described as \"a wondrous feat of conflating rag rugs to riches.\" Whilst still defined as haute couture, Vagabonds was noted to be a more wearable collection from the duo, offering the public a practical display of eco-friendly haute couture.Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Spring/Summer 2017)\nImperfection was the central concept of Viktor & Rolf\u2019s most recent haute couture collection. Recalling the message of recycling from the Vagabonds, Boulevard of Broken Dreams pairs contrasting patterned fabric with a fantastical and delicate colour palette. The recycled layers appear almost like shards of glass placed onto Viktor & Rolf\u2019s signature exaggerated couture forms. The designers chose to consciously exploit such imperfections, following the Japanese principle of Kintsugi by gilding faults and seams in gold.  The aesthetic and intention of the collection was summarised by critic Suzy Menkes: \"The patchwork of grandeur was as pretty in its choice of colour as it was in the feminine shapes. And if recycling could be this elegant, maybe it could draw more fashion people to the party.\"\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nBelow is a comprehensive list of art exhibitions which have featured the work of Viktor & Rolf. The sheer number is a testament to the artistic value of their garments.\n1994\n\nFebruary\u2013March: L\u2019Hiver de l\u2019Amour - Mus\u00e9e d \u2018Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (group exhibition)\nMarch: Le Cri n\u00e9erlandais - Institut N\u00e9erlandais, Paris (group exhibition)1995\n\nOctober: L\u2019Apparence du Vide - Galerie Patricia Forfmann, Paris\nDecember\u2013January 1996: Collections - Galerie Analix, Geneva (group exhibition)1996 \n\nOctober: Launch - Torch Gallery, Amsterdam1997\n\nApril\u2013May: Viktor & Rolf: Le Regard noir - Stedelijk Museum Bureau, Amsterdam1998\n\nJuly\u2013September: The First 25 - Colette, Paris (group exhibition)1999\n\nApril\u2013May: Viktor & Rolf: 21st Century Boys - Aeroplastics Contemporary, Brussels\nApril -June: Visions of the Body: Fashion or Invisible Corset - The Kyoto Costume Institute, Japan (group exhibition)\nMay: Viktor & Rolf - Visionaire Gallery, New York\nMay\u2013June: Creative Time in the Anchorage: Exposing Meaning in Fashion Through Presentation - Brooklyn Bridge Anchorage, New York (group exhibition)\nJune- October: Heaven: An Exhibition That Will Break Your Heart - Kunsthalle D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany (group exhibition)2000 \n\nNovember\u2013March 2001: Viktor & Rolf Haute Couture - Groninger Museum, Groningen2001\n\nMarch\u2013May: Mohri Colour and Space Part 5 (Sayoko) - Kobe Fashion Museum, Japan (group exhibition)\nSeptember\u2013November: YOKOHAMA 2001: International Triennale of Contemporary Art - Japan (group exhibition)2003\n\nOctober\u2013January 2004: Viktor & Rolf par Viktor & Rolf, premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie - Mus\u00e9e de la Mode et du Textile, Paris2004 \n\nApril\u2013December: Fashion in Colours: Viktor & Rolf & KCI - The Kyoto Costume Institute, Japan\nMay\u2013August: Goddess - ModeMuseum, Antwerp, Belgium (group exhibition)\nJune\u2013September: Skin Tight: The Sensibility of the Flesh - Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (group exhibition)\nSeptember\u2013January 2005: Spectres: When Fashion Turns Back - ModeMuseum, Antwerp, Belgium (group exhibition)\nSeptember\u2013January 2005: Fashination - Moderna Museet, Stockholm (group exhibition)2005\n\nSeptember\u2013December: Dutch at the Edge of Design: Fashion and Textiles from the Netherlands - The Museum at FIT, New York (group exhibition)2006\n\nNovember\u2013March 2007: Skin + Bones: Parallel Practices in Fashion and Architecture - The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (group exhibition)\nNovember\u2013March 2007: Fashion Show: Paris Collections 2006 - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (group exhibition)2007\n\nMay\u2013September: Picture House - Belsay Hall, Northumberland, England (group exhibition)2008\n\nJune\u2013September: The House of Viktor & Rolf - Barbican Art Gallery, London, England\nNovember\u2013February 2009: The House of Viktor & Rolf - Centraal Museum, Utrecht, The Netherlands2016\n\nOctober\u2013February 2017: Viktor & Rolf Fashion Artists - National Gallery of Victoria, Australia2018\n\nMay\u2013September: Viktor & Rolf Fashion Artists 25 Years - Kunsthal, Rotterdam, The Netherlands\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Viktor & Rolf at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website",

          "I must confess I love fashion hence the high ranking. What is presently showing is the Madame Gres exhibition which, as wonderful as it is, is quite sparse (I found more pictures of lovelier dresses on the net). That is to say, there was only one exhibition on. I realise that",

          "As much as it distresses me, I have to admit I found this museum disappointing. This mostly has to do with the basement where you are sent to put your handbag in a locker. The white-painted walls have a grey line of dirt where they meet the floors, the elevator surrounds looks",
          "I was at this museum recently and the collection was very limited. There was one single collection on display with dresses from 1750-1950. No clothing of after that period, nothing of a period before that. Furthermore it was only female clothing, no male clothing whatsoever.",

The major works are from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\n\n\n== History ==\nFritz Mayer van den Bergh, born in 1858, collected art for most of his life, making his most expensive and important additions between 1897 and his death in 1901. He was especially interested in art from the 14th to sixteenth century, while his contemporaries considered the Gothic and Renaissance art dated. This fact enabled him to create a collection of 1.000 pieces of mostly Northern Renaissance art. After his death, his mother Henriette Mayer van den Bergh built a neo-gothic house in the banking district of Antwerp between 1901 and 1904, as a museum for the expansive art collection.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nBreviarium Mayer van den Bergh, a late 15th-century or early 16th-century illustrated manuscript of 1412 pages, probably made for a rich Portuguese in Antwerp by Simon Bening, Gerard Horenbout and Jan Provost, Flemish miniaturists from the Ghent-Bruges school.\nPieter Brueghel the Elder: Dulle Griet (Mad Meg or Dull Gret), ca. 1562\nPieter Brueghel the Elder: Proverbs'\nMaster Heinrich of Constance, Christ and Saint John Group, 14th century\nPieter Huys, The Temptation of Saint Anthony, 1577\nJan Mabuse, Magdalen\nQuentin Matsys, Crucifixion\na Pleurant, 15th Century.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "This museum contains one man's collection. Mayer van den Bergh collected items that took his interest for 20 years before his premature death in the early 20th century. His mother continued with his life dream and turned his collection into a museum. It's not a big museum but",
          "Only wnet because we got a joint ticket with the Rubens Museum but after visiting both, we (4 of us) agreed that this was exceptional value. Great eclectic mix and something for everyone.",

          "I've bought a combined ticket for the Rubens house and this museum by chance. Fritz Mayer van den Bergh was passionate about the art. After his death, his mother has the museum built in a Gothic Revival style. The house provides a home for his impressive colection: paintings",
          "This museum looked quite ordinary on the outside and then you walk in and the house takes you back to the middle ages, I loved it. The collection is beautiful and I especially enjoyed the paintings. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The museum was built to house Fritz Mayer van den Bergh's large art collection after his premature death in 1901. The building's interior is beautiful and it contains many paintings including a large selection of Breugel.",
          "Great Breughals. Get a double ticket with Rubens House for only 2 euros extra. Good visit near to centre of town.",
          "Located in the city center the museum is placed in the old private house and definitely have a mood. The collection is not that big, but some objects are beautiful. Probably it is overselled in the city guides",
          "A must see for Flemish art aficionados. The paintings were incredibly well lit and the variety and abundance of collection is astounding",
          "The collector Fritz Mayer van den Bergh managed to build a fantastic collection of art and antiques before he died at the sad young age of 43. The house itself is glorious, wonderful tapestries in the staircase, lots of interesting old artworks, and the best of all: A room full",
          "The museum displays the personal collection of a discriminating art lover and connoisseur, and almost every piece is of outstanding quality. The collection is well organised and beautifully displayed. It is one of the most perfect art museums in Belgium, and it is worth going",
          "We love the art of the low countries and medieval art generally. If you do too, then do not miss this museum under any circumstances if you are in Antwerp (and if you are not in Antwerp but nearby then take a detour, you won't regret it). Mr Mayer van den Bergh was a collector",
          "as a house it is important...but that the owner died in his 40's and his mother donated the art & the house to the city was fabulous..he bought art everywhere..travel extensively..",

          "This museum was almost overwhelming as there are a large number of works throughout the house. It is worth a visit if you buy the combination ticket at Ruben's House for \u20ac10 (it costs \u20ac8 just to visit Ruben's House)",
          "Paintings collected by the founder of this museum. I hop in very regularly. One of my favorite museums.",
          "What an amazing museum! The old art collector's house is beautiful! Stunning art pieces and beautiful interiors takes you back to a wonderful victorian time! Really worth the visit!",
          "A relatively small museum hosting an incredible collection of art. There are no \u201cfillers\u201d as it\u2019s often the case in large museums \u2013 every single item is a masterpiece. The house interiors are very interesting by themselves as well.",
          "Fascinating private art collection spanning several centuries of artwoks. Reminds me of the Frick Collection in Manhattan, except the house furnishings are older and probably more valuable. Many of the artists represented here are unheralded, but worth the look.",
          "This small but stellar collection is thoughtfully displayed in a beautiful building, purpose- built for the collection at the turn of the last century. Just enough works to fully absorb. This museum might be overlooked, but that would be a mistake. Can buy a combo ticket that",
          "After Rockox House and Rubens we wondered if we'd seen enough art, but didn't want to miss Mad Meg. So glad we went to Museum Mayer van den Berg to do this. A varied collection of exemplar pieces in many media, from 8th to 19th Century, and lovely staff too!",
          "The museum is a real find. It was on our list because of the Breugels (Dulle Griet/ Census at Bethlehem) and of course these were incredible but we found so much more. As the guy below said, the cherrystone necklace- wow- each individually carved and little faces on them-",
          "The oldest painting in the Netherlands is held in this building, and the stained glass, wallpaper, and furnishings upstairs make this a mix of a gorgeous mansion and a private museum. I loved it.",
          "This museum deserves its rating on the strength of Brueghel's Dulle Griet alone, but it contains many other treasures that reflect the taste of the man who assembled this collection. It is housed in a mansion that has been adapted for museum use and has recently acquired a new",
          "Buy a joint ticket with the Rubens House to get a deal. There is a lot of stuff here, some of it not so great and labeling is minimal. However when we reached the Breughel room upstairs our visit seemed totally worth while. Awesome paintings!",
          "10 Euro gets you both the Mayer Museum and Rubens House. Some nice art. Cool house and most descriptions in English so nice.",
          "This museum has an important Breugel (Dulle Griet aka Mad Meg) & it's worth coming here for that alone. The English guide was good to get for free but it was difficult at first to identify the room you were in & then the exhibits described. You can get a combined ticket with",
          "The Mayer van den Bergh Museum I would characterize as a smaller museum, but its holdings make it major in terms of how much wonderful material there is to see. It took me a while to get my bearings in this museum, though - the English booklet we were given were not very",
          "Very nice old building which has a nice collection of old painters. Don't miss Pieter Bruegel's Dulle Griet !",
          "It took me 25 years to visit this place. Because for most of that time, the museum looked simply too classical for me. An old interior of the beginning of the 20th century, leather and gold on the walls, dark paintings. But now I am wiser and older. This is a fantastic",
          "The building alone is worth the visit. Having visited this museum to see the Pieter Bruegel paintings on exhibit, I was amazed at the wonderful collection of Mayer van den Burgh that was packed into this beautiful purpose built building. A must see place on your Antwerp visit.",
          "This place will become one of your favorite places in Antwerp, and therefore in Belgium. Small is beautiful. I found myself staring for 5 minutes at a piece of lace. And they have a necklace made out of carved cherrystones. That kind of place.",
          "Don't miss this collection. Such a masterpieces to collect is not easy. More importand is willing to show the world all that beauty. There are bigger private collections and collectors, but they keep all that for their eyes only. Collector whose eyes are wide open should be",
          "Enjoyed the permanent collection of art and furnishings as well as a temporary exhibition by Pieter Bruegel.",
          "Some people suggest \"if you have little time\" My suggestion is \"take all the time you can\" I spent hours wide open mouth on all you can see in this rather small wonderful museum.",
          "a more familiar way to experience are- the museum is actually a house.. the highlight was the Breugel 'Dulle Griet' !!! Also two paintings of Breugel II, and many prints of Breugel- defenetly worth seeing..:).. combi tiket with Rubens house- 10 \u20ac .. both worth seeing..",
          "Even better than the Rubens House. Beautiful furniture/walls/rooms and paintings, books etcetc. For 8 euro you buy a ticket incl. a visit for both Houses. Mayer van den Bergh is really worth visiting. On walking distance from the Rubens House.",
          "This is a total gem! It is a must-see in Antwerp. The Breughel room is magnificent. There is a wonderful mixture of portraits, still-lives, sculpture, jewellery. This ranks close to the Rubens Huis in terms of what is worthwhile visiting in Antwerp.",
          "I've been blessed to be in Antwerp several times and I enjoy taking people here. Museums are free on fourth Wednesdays. My favorite part of this house is the proverbs painting. Ask and they will give you a list. There are over 100 proverbs shown in the painting, many of which",
          "A good insight into the mind of an avid art collector and expert at the end of the 19th century.",
          "Mayer van den Bergh was a wealthy art collector who devoted his short life to traveling around Europe and purchasing exquisite works of art from various countries and from different eras. When he passed away at 41, his mother converted this building into a museum to house his",
          "Plenty of excellent Flemish art here by world renowned painters.",
          "This place is probably more telling about Antwerp's past than some of the other more typical tourist trail locations. In my book there is this trinity of Rubenshuis, Plantyn and Mayer vd Bergh.",
          "My main thrill with this collection was the Breughal paintings. Images I know but didn't think I would see. The Breughal father and son (wasn't familiar with the work of the other Breughal brother - Jan - are two of my favourite painters.",
          "Breugel and Bosch, in a small and less know museum, if you have not much time : choose this one it offers a wide scope and top pieces",
          "Art lovers will enjoy this small private house in the Old Town. This magnificent private collection was assembled in the late 19th century by a true connaisseur.",
          "This museum, in the former house of Mr and Mrs Mayer van den Bergh, is not a real eyecatcher amongst the Antwerp museums, at least from the outside. Inside, however, you'll find one of the best collections of early Flemish Primitives and renaissance paintings in the",
          "Buy a ticket for Ruben's house and this museum and it is only 2 euros more. Students get in to most museums in Antwerp for 1 euro which is great. Look out for the lovely Snow scene by Breughel.",
          "I like the idea of museums in houses, as they convey a sense of intimacy with the objects on view. Van den Bergh was a very rich merchant who wanted art to be enjoyed by everyone, but sadly he fell off a horse and died at the age of 43 and didn't complete his mission. However,",
          "Maybe not as well known as other museums or attractions in the city but this is unjustified. The museum is the former house of Fritz Mayer van den Bergh, who was an art collector. Not only is the collection very fine, also the house itself is very beautiful and makes the visit",
          "Being greatly interested in art This place was just wonderful our driver took some time to find it and came with us walking around the house and gallery which is close to the beach It is a very old house and dark more light would have been great There is a small charge paid",
          "Beautiful museum house. One of the highlights of my trip. Must see.",
          "This place was once a private house with a huge art collection. Go there and find out what a young man made become a misantropist and art collector.",
          "More paintings and just a lovely old house to visit. The visit was free as we had already visited the Rubens House.",
          "This House-Museum is easy to overlook. But especially with the large art museum (Royal Museum-KMSKA) closed for renovation until 2017, it's very worthwhile and easy to get to. Although one man's private collection, the quality is very high, with no duds. It's seldom crowded.",
          "I love museums that are in old houses, and this place is just incredible. Small collection of Flemish paintings. You can buy a combination ticket for both this museum and Rubens House for 6 euros.",
          "A little off the beaten path, easy walk from the Hilton. Just a great little museum. I go there every time I visit Antwerp, which has been 3 times now. If you like von Bruegels it the place to go"

        "wiki": "Antwerp ( (listen); Dutch: Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen); French: Anvers [\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281s] (listen)) is a city in Belgium and the capital of Antwerp province in the Flemish Region. With a population of 520,504, it is the most populous city proper in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people, it is the second largest metropolitan region after Brussels.Antwerp is on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe and within the top 20 globally. The city is also known for its diamond industry and trade.\nBoth economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt. Antwerp was also the place of the world's oldest stock exchange building, originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872.The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren (Dutch pronunciation: [s\u026a\u0272\u02c8jo\u02d0r\u0259(n)]), after the Spanish honorific se\u00f1or or French seigneur, \"lord\", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century. The city hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is New Latin.A Germanic (Frankish or Frisian) origin could contain prefix anda (\u201cagainst\u201d) and a noun derived from the verb werpen (\u201cto throw\u201d) and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit; a mound (like a terp) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf. If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean \"those who live on both banks\".There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river. He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt.\n\n\n=== Pre-1500 ===\nHistorical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952\u20131961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. The earliest mention of Antwerp dates from the 4th century.\nIn the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks.The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II, a border province facing the County of Flanders.\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon,  was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nAfter the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant, grew in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly enslaved Africans as the century progressed. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544\u20131574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became \"the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height.\" Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the \"Age of Exploration\". During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps.  Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas\".\n\nWithout a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venetian Republic, Republic of Ragusa, Spain and Portugal.  Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \"To the merchants of all nations.\" Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers.  In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth.  Numerous financial bankruptcies  began around 1557. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nThe religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries. The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury: 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over \u00a32 million sterling of damage was done.\n\n\n=== Dutch revolt ===\nSubsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa, and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock) and an access- lock and mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.\n\nIn 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chass\u00e9. For a time Chass\u00e9 subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass\u00e9 made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi)  from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAntwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During World War I, the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Li\u00e8ge. The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.\nAntwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. \nDuring World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote, V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic) Orthodox Judaism.\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into nine entities (districts):\n\nAntwerp\nBerchem\nBerendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo\nBorgerhout\nDeurne\nEkeren\nHoboken\nMerksem\nWilrijkIn 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp, the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.\n\n\n== Buildings and landmarks ==\n\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was noted for the wealth of its citizens (\"Antwerpia nummis\"). The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the Hanseatic League on the northern quays, in 1891. During World War II, the city also suffered considerable damage from V-bombs, and in recent years, other noteworthy buildings have been demolished for new developments.\n\nAntwerp Zoo opened in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the world.\nAntwerp City Hall dates from 1565, and is built primarily in Renaissance style.\nAntwerp Central Station is a railway station designed by Louis Delacenserie which was completed in 1905.\nCathedral of Our Lady. This church was begun in the 14th century and finished in 1518. The church has four works by Rubens, viz. \"The Descent from the Cross\", \"The Elevation of the Cross\", \"The Resurrection of Christ\" and \"The Assumption\"\nSt. James' Church, is more ornate than the cathedral. It contains the remains of numerous famous nobles, among them a major part of the family of Rubens.\nThe Church of St. Paul has a baroque interior. It is a few hundred yards north of the Grote Markt\nSt. Andrew's Church\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church\nMuseum Vleeshuis (Butchers' Hall) is a fine Gothic brick-built building, situated a short distance to the North-West of the Grote Markt.\nPlantin-Moretus Museum preserves the house of the printer Christoffel Plantijn and his successor Jan Moretus\nThe Saint-Boniface Church is an Anglican church and headseat of the archdeanery North-West Europe.\nBoerentoren (Farmers' Tower) or KBC Tower, a 26-storey building built in 1932, is the oldest skyscraper in Europe. It is the tallest building in Antwerp and the second tallest structure after the Cathedral of our Lady. The building was designed by Emiel van Averbeke, R. Van Hoenacker and Jos Smolderen.\nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts\nMuseum Mayer van den Bergh, with works from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nRubenshuis is the former home and studio of Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) in Antwerp. It is now a museum.\nRockox House is the former 17th-century Residence of Nicolaas II Rockox, lord Mayor of Antwerp.\nBourse of Antwerp. Originally built 1531; extensively restored 1872; now Antwerp Trade Fair.\nPalace of Justice, designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006. This building is the antithesis of the heavy, dark court building, designed by Joseph Poelaert, which dominates the skyline of Brussels. The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built on the site of the old Zuid (\"South\") station, at the end of a magnificent 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12). The building's highest 'sail' is 51 m (167 ft) high, has a floor area of 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft), and cost \u20ac130 million.\nZurenborg, a late-19th-century Belle \u00c9poque neighbourhood, on the border of Antwerp and Berchem, with many Art Nouveau architectural elements. The area counts as one of the most original Belle \u00c9poque urban expansion areas in Europe.\nMuseum aan de Stroom\nDen Botaniek or Antwerp's Botanical Garden, created in 1825. Located in the city centre, at the Leopoldstraat, it covers an area of almost 1 hectare.\nHarmonium Art museuM, a museum on pump organs in Klein-Willebroek\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (M HKA)\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\n\nAlthough Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former enceinte, only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. A replica of a castle named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais in the 19th century.\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:\n\n10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch\n12th and 13th century: canals (so called \"vlieten\" and \"ruien\") were made\n16th century: Spanish fortifications\n19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications\n20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\nThis is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.\n\n\n=== Minorities ===\nIn 2010, 36% to 39% of the inhabitants of Antwerp had a migrant background. A study projects that in 2020, 55% of the population will be of migrant background.\n\n\n==== Jewish community ====\n\nAfter The Holocaust and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic, live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff  (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk, based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Ger, Skver, Klausenburg, Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\n==== Jain community ====\n\nThe Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business. Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds. A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk).  Mr Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a full-fledged member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nThere are significant Armenian communities that reside in Antwerp, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with a smaller numbers are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church.\nOne of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel and involved in is the diamond trade business, that based primarily in the diamond district. Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nAccording to the American Association of Port Authorities, the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014\u20132020.  The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.\n\n\n=== Diamonds ===\nAntwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion. The city has four diamond bourses: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers. Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian and Maronite Christian from Lebanon and Armenian, traders become increasingly important.Antwerp World Diamond Centre, (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry. However, in recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nA six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to Brussels, Hasselt and Li\u00e8ge, Ghent, Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"Oosterweelconnection\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to Amsterdam and Paris, and national trains to Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Brussels, Charleroi, Hasselt, Li\u00e8ge, Leuven and Turnhout.\nAntwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald's haunting novel Austerlitz. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"premetro\" and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nA small airport, Antwerp International Airport, is located in the district of Deurne, with passenger service to various European destinations. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre.\nThe now defunct VLM Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport. This office is also CityJet's Antwerp office. When VG Airlines (Delsey Airlines) existed, its head office was located in the district of Merksem.Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport, is about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.\nThere is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs twice every hour on working days.\nThe runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.\nIn September 2019 Air Antwerp began operations with their first route to London City Airport with old VLM Airlines Fokker 50's.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections.\nThe current majority consists of N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld, led by mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA).\n\n\n=== Former mayors ===\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century important mayors include Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Nicolaas II Rockox.\nIn the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti\u00e8ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (New Flemish Alliance).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntwerp has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) similar to that of Southern England, while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) average highs for both July and August. Winters are more dominated by the maritime currents instead, with temps being heavily moderated.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAntwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its school of painting, which included Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the Teniers and many others.\n\nInformally, most Antverpians (in Dutch Antwerpenaren, people from Antwerp) speak Antverpian daily (in Dutch Antwerps), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other Brabantic dialects for its characteristic pronunciation of vowels: an 'aw' sound approximately like that in 'bore' is used for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the 'a' in 'hat'. The Echt Antwaarps Teater (\"Authentic Antverpian Theatre\") brings the dialect on stage.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nAntwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in the world. It has served as the learning centre for many Belgian fashion designers. Since the 1980s, several graduates of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts have become internationally successful fashion designers in Antwerp. The city has had a huge influence on other Belgian fashion designers such as Raf Simons, Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Theyskens and Kris Van Assche.\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nAntwerp is famous for its local products. In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally \"Antwerp Hands\". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.\n\n\n=== Missions to seafarers ===\nA number of Christian missions to seafarers are based in Antwerp, notably on the Itali\u00eblei. These include the Mission to Seafarers, British & International Sailors' Society, the Finnish Seamen's Mission, the Norwegian Sj\u00f8mannskirken and the Apostleship of the Sea. They provide cafeterias, cultural and social activities as well as religious services.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAntwerp is the home of the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC), founded in 1938 and located on the square Grote Markt since 1994.The band dEUS was formed in 1991 in Antwerp. dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material. Their musical influences range from folk and punk to jazz and progressive rock.\n\n\n=== Music festivals ===\nCultuurmarkt van Vlaanderen is a musical festival and a touristic attraction that takes place annually on the final Sunday of August in the city center of Antwerp. Where international and local musicians and actors, present their stage and street performances.Linkerwoofer is a pop-rock music festival located at the left bank of the Scheldt. This music festival starts in August and mostly local Belgian musicians play and perform in this event.Other popular festivals Fire Is Gold, and focuses more on urban music, and Summerfestival.\n\n\n=== World Choir Games ===\nThe city of Antwerp will co-host the 2020 World Choir Games together with the city of Ghent. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAntwerp held the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were the first games after the First World War and also the only ones to be held in Belgium. The road cycling events took place in the streets of the city.Royal Antwerp F.C., currently playing in the Belgian First Division, were founded in 1880 and is known as 'The Great Old' for being the first club registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1895. Since 1998, the club has taken Manchester United players on loan in an official partnership. Another club in the city was Beerschot VAC, founded in 1899 by former Royal Antwerp players. They played at the Olympisch Stadion, the main venue of the 1920 Olympics. Nowadays KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk plays at the Olympisch Stadion in the Belgian Second Division.\nThe Antwerp Giants play in Basketball League Belgium and Topvolley Antwerpen play in the Belgium men's volleyball League.\nFor the year 2013, Antwerp was awarded the title of European Capital of Sport.\nAntwerp hosted the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nAntwerp hosted the start of stage 3 of the 2015 Tour de France on 6 July 2015.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\nAntwerp has a university and several colleges. The University of Antwerp  (Universiteit Antwerpen) was established in 2003, following the merger of the RUCA, UFSIA and UIA institutes. Their roots go back to 1852. The University has approximately 23,000 registered students, making it the third-largest university in Flanders, as well as 1,800 foreign students. It has 7 faculties, spread over four campus locations in the city centre and in the south of the city.\nThe city has several colleges, including Antwerp Management School (AMS), Charlemagne University College (Karel de Grote Hogeschool), Plantin University College (Plantijn Hogeschool), and Artesis University College (Artesis Hogeschool).

          "It was not in my list, but after seeing the Steen castle I tried to improvise in my walking plan and came across this house (the Butcher's hall) which is now a museum. I did not enter the museum, but the house and its surroundings were a real nice surprise. Old houses with",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Charles Borromeo (Italian: Carlo Borromeo, Latin: Carolus Borromeus, 2 October 1538 \u2013 3 November 1584) was the Latin archbishop of Milan from 1564 to 1584 and a cardinal of the Catholic Church. He was a leading figure of the Counter-Reformation combat against the Protestant Reformation together with St. Ignatius of Loyola and St. Philip Neri. In that role he was responsible for significant reforms in the Catholic Church, including the founding of seminaries for the education of priests. He is honored as a saint by the Catholic Church, with a feast day on November 4.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCharles was a descendant of nobility: the Borromeo family was one of the most ancient and wealthy in Lombardy, made famous by several notable men, both in the church and state. The family coat of arms included the Borromean rings, which are sometimes taken to symbolize the Holy Trinity. Charles' father Gilbert was Count of Arona.  His mother Margaret was a member of the Milan branch of the House of Medici. The third son in a family of six children, he was born in the castle of Arona on Lake Maggiore 36 miles from Milan on 2 October 1538.Borromeo received the tonsure when he was about twelve years old. At this time his paternal uncle Giulio Cesare Borromeo turned over to him the income from the rich Benedictine abbey of Sts. Gratinian and Felin, one of the ancient perquisites of the family. Charles made plain to his father that all revenues from the abbey beyond what was required to prepare him for a career in the Church belonged to the poor and could not be applied to secular use. The young man attended the University of Pavia, where he applied himself to the study of civil and canon law. Due to a slight impediment of a speech he was regarded as slow but his thoroughness and industry meant that he made rapid progress. In 1554 his father died, and although he had an elder brother, Count Federico, he was requested by the family to take the management of their domestic affairs. After a time, he resumed his studies, and on 6 December 1559, he earned a doctorate in canon and civil law.\n\n\n== Rome period ==\nOn 25 December 1559 Borromeo's uncle Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Medici was elected as Pope Pius IV. The newly-elected pope required his nephew to come to Rome, and on 13 January 1560 appointed him protonotary apostolic. Shortly thereafter, on 31 January 1560, the pope created him cardinal, and thus Charles as cardinal-nephew was entrusted with both the public and the privy seal of the ecclesiastical state. He was also brought into the government of the Papal States and appointed a supervisor of the Franciscans, Carmelites and Knights of Malta.\nDuring his four years in Rome Borromeo lived in austerity, obliged the Roman Curia to wear black, and established an academy of learned persons, the Academy of the Vatican Knights, publishing their memoirs as the Noctes Vaticanae.Charles organized the third and last session of the Council of Trent, in 1562-63. He had a large share in the making of the Tridentine Catechism (Catechismus Romanus). In 1561, Borromeo founded and endowed a college at Pavia, today known as Almo Collegio Borromeo, which he dedicated to St. Justina of Padua.\nOn 19 November 1562, his older brother, Federico, suddenly died. His family urged Charles to seek permission to return to the lay state (laicization), to marry and have children so that the family name would not become extinct, but he decided not to leave the ecclesiastic state. His brother's death, along with his contacts with the Jesuits and the Theatines and the example of bishops such as Bartholomew of Braga, were the causes of a conversion of Charles towards a more strict and operative Christian life, and his aim became to put into practice the dignity and duties of the bishop as drafted by the recent Council of Trent.\n\n\n== Archbishop of Milan ==\nCharles was appointed an administrator of the  Archdiocese of Milan on 7 February 1560. After his decision to put into practice the role of bishop, he decided to be ordained priest (4 September 1563) and on 7 December 1563 he was consecrated bishop in the Sistine Chapel by Cardinal Giovanni Serbelloni. Charles was formally appointed archbishop of Milan on 12 May 1564 after the former archbishop Ippolito II d'Este waived his claims on that archbishopric, but he was only allowed by the pope to leave Rome one year later. Charles made his formal entry into Milan as archbishop on 23 September 1565.\n\n\n=== Reform in Milan ===\n\nAfter the death of his uncle, Pius IV (1566), Charles contributed materially to suppressing the cabals of the conclave. Before Charles went to Milan, while he was overseeing reform in Rome, a nobleman remarked that the latter city was no longer a place to enjoy oneself or to make a fortune. \"Carlo Borromeo has undertaken to remake the city from top to bottom,\" he said, predicting that the reformer's enthusiasm \"would lead him to correct the rest of the world once he has finished with Rome.\"Subsequently, he devoted himself to the reformation of his diocese which had deteriorated in practice owing to the 80-year absence of previous archbishops. Milan was the largest archdiocese in Italy at the time, with more than 3,000 clergy and 800,000 people. Both its clergy and laity had drifted from church teaching. The selling of indulgences and ecclesiastical positions was prevalent; monasteries were \"full of disorder\"; many religious were \"lazy, ignorant, and debauched\". Charles made numerous pastoral visits, and restored dignity to divine service. He urged churches to be designed in conformity with the decrees of the Council of Trent, which stated that sacred art and architecture lacking adequate scriptural  foundation was in effect prohibited, as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art. He divided the nave of the church into two compartments to separate the sexes at worship.\nHe extended his reforms to the collegiate churches, monasteries and even to the Confraternities of Penitents, particularly that of St. John the Baptist. This group was to attend to prisoners and those condemned to death, to give them help and support.\n\nCharles believed that abuses in the church arose from ignorant clergy. Among his most important actions, he established seminaries, colleges, and communities for the education of candidates for holy orders. His emphasis on Catholic learning greatly increased the preparation of men for the priesthood and benefited their congregations. In addition, he founded the fraternity of Oblates of St. Ambrose, a society of secular men who did not take orders, but devoted themselves to the church and followed a discipline of monastic prayers and study.  They provided assistance to parishes where ordered by the church. The new archbishop's efforts for catechesis and the instruction of youth included the initiation of the first \u201cSunday School\u201d classes and the work of the Confraternity for Christian Doctrine.\nBorromeo diocesan reforms faced opposition from several religious orders, particularly that of the Humiliati (Brothers of Humility), a penitential order which, although reduced to about 170 members, owned some ninety monasteries. Some members of that society formed a conspiracy against his life, and a shot was fired at him in the archiepiscopal chapel.  His survival was considered miraculous.In 1576 there was famine at Milan due to crop failures, and later an outbreak of the plague. The city's trade fell off, and along with it the people's source of income. The Governor and many members of the nobility fled the city, but the bishop remained, to organize the care of those affected and to minister to the dying. He called together the superiors of all the religious communities in the diocese and won their cooperation. Borromeo tried to feed 60,000 to 70,000 people daily. He used up his own funds and went into debt to provide food for the hungry. Finally, he wrote to the Governor, and successfully persuaded him to return.\n\n\n=== Influence on English affairs ===\nCharles had also been involved in English affairs when he assisted Pius IV. Many English Catholics had fled to Italy at this time because of the persecutions under Queen Elizabeth I. He gave pastoral attention to English Catholics who fled to Italy to escape the new laws against the Catholic faith. Saint Edmund Campion, a Jesuit, along with Saint Ralph Sherwin visited him at Milan in 1580 on their way to England.  They stayed with him for eight days, talking with him every night after dinner. A Welshman, Griffith Roberts, served as his canon theologian, and an Englishman, Thomas Goldwell, as vicar-general. The archbishop carried on his person a small picture of John Fisher, who, with Thomas More, had been executed during the reign of Henry VIII, and for whom he held a great veneration.  During the nineteenth-century Catholic restoration in England, Cardinal Wiseman was to institute an order of Oblates of St Charles, led by Henry Edward Manning, as a congregation of secular priests directly supporting the Archbishop of Westminster.\n\n\n=== Persecution of religious dissidents ===\n\nThough the Diet of Ilanz of 1524 and 1526 had proclaimed freedom of worship in the Republic of the Three Leagues, Charles repressed Protestantism in the Swiss valleys. The Catholic Encyclopedia relates: \u201cIn November [1583] he began a visitation as Apostolic visitor of all the cantons of Switzerland and the Grisons, leaving the affairs of his diocese in the hands of Monsignor Owen Lewis, his vicar-general. He began in the Mesoleina Valley; here not only was their heresy to be fought, but also witchcraft and sorcery, and at Roveredo it was discovered that \"the provost or rector, was the foremost in sorceries.\u201d During his pastoral visit to the region, 150 people were arrested for practicing witchcraft. Eleven women and the provost were condemned to be burned alive.Reacting to the pressure of the Protestant Reformation, Borromeo encouraged Ludwig Pfyffer in his development of the Golden League, but did not live to see its formation in 1586.  Based in Lucerne, the organization (also called the Borromean League) linked activities of several Swiss Catholic cantons of Switzerland, which became the center of Catholic Counter-Reformation efforts.  This organization was determined to expel heretics and burned some people at the stake. It created severe strains in the civil administration of the confederation, and caused the break-up of Appenzell canton along religious lines.\n\n\n== Controversy and last days ==\n\nBorromeo was described by a biographer as \u201can austere, dedicated, humorless and uncompromising personality\u201d. Charged with implementing the reforms dictated by the Council of Trent, his uncompromising stance brought him into conflict with secular leaders, priests, and even the Pope. He met with much opposition to his reforms. The governor of the province and many of the senators addressed complaints to the courts of Rome and Madrid.\nIn 1584, during his annual retreat at Monte Varallo, he fell ill with \"intermittent fever and ague\", and on returning to Milan grew rapidly worse. After receiving the Last Sacraments, he died quietly on 4 November at the age of 46.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\nFollowing his death, popular devotion to Charles arose quickly and continued to grow. The Milanese celebrated his anniversary as though he were already a saint, and supporters in a number of cities collected documentation to support his canonization.  In 1602 Clement VIII beatified Charles. In 1604 his case was sent on to the Congregation of Rites. On 1 November 1610, Paul V canonized Charles. Three years later, the church added his feast to the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 4 November. Along with Guarinus of Palestrina and perhaps Anselm of Lucca, he is one of only two or three cardinal-nephews to have been canonized.\nCharles Borromeo is the patron saint of bishops, catechists and seminarians.\n\n\n=== Iconography ===\nBorromeo's emblem is the Latin word humilitas (humility), which is a portion of the Borromeo shield. He is usually represented in art in his robes, barefoot, carrying the cross as archbishop, a rope around his neck, one hand raised in blessing, thus recalling his work during the plague.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCharles' biography was originally written by three of his contemporaries: Agostino Valerio (afterwards cardinal and Bishop of Verona) and Carlo Bascape (General of the Barnabites, afterwards Bishop of Novara), who wrote their contributions in Latin, and Pietro Giussanno (a priest), who wrote his in Italian. Father Giussanno's account was the most detailed of the three.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nBorromeo's correspondence shows his influential position in Europe during his lifetime. The popes under whom he served sought his advice. The Catholic sovereigns of Europe \u2013 Henry III of France, Philip II of Spain, Mary, Queen of Scots \u2013 and others showed how they valued his influence. Cardinal Valerio of Verona said of him that Borromeo was \"to the well-born a pattern of virtue, to his brother cardinals an example of true nobility.\" Cardinal Baronius styled him \"a second Ambrose, whose early death, lamented by all good men, inflicted great loss on the Church.\"\nLate in the sixteenth or at the beginning of the seventeenth century, Catholics in England  circulated among themselves a \"Life of St. Charles\".\n\n\n=== Monuments ===\nContrary to Borromeo's last wishes, the Duomo di Milano created a memorial crypt to honor him at the church.\nHis relative Federico Borromeo and admirers commissioned a statue 20 m high that was erected on the hill above Arona, as they regarded him an important leader of the Counter-Reformation.\n\n\n=== Writings ===\nBesides the Noctes Vaticanae, to which he appeared to have contributed, Borromeo's written legacy consisted only of some homilies, discourses and sermons, with a collection of letters.  Borromeo's sermons have been translated into many languages.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nA large number of churches dedicated to St. Charles Borromeo exist, such as: \n\nSt. Charles Parish, Spokane, Washington\nSt. Charles Borromeo Roman Catholic Oratory, North Kelvinside, Glasgow, Scotland.\nCathedral of San Carlos Borromeo, California\nKarlskirche, Vienna\nSt Charles Borromeo Church, Sheffield\nSt Charles Borromeo Church, Hadfield, England\nMission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo, California\nOur Lady and St Charles Borromeo Catholic Church, Wisbech, England\nSan Carlo alle Quattro Fontane, Rome\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church, Antwerp\nSt. Charles Borromeo Cemetery Church, Vienna\nSt. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church, A\u0161, part Mok\u0159iny\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church (Destrehan, Louisiana)St. Charles Borromeo Church (New York City)\nSt. Charles's Church (Staten Island, New York)\nSt. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church (Nederland, Texas)\nSt. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church and Academy (Pt.

          "The jesuits went \"all in\" when they build this baroque jewel. If you are really lucky, you might see the changing of the immense paintings behind the altar ! Linger a while on the square in front of the church to admire the facade but also the statue of Hendrik Conscience. He",

          "As far as I know, the monumental facade of the Carolus Borromeus Church is the most Northern Baroque facade of Europe. The square (Hendrik Conscienceplein) in front of the church, and the church itself resemble France or Italy. The interior of the church is well worth a visit",

        "wiki": "Antwerp ( (listen); Dutch: Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen); French: Anvers [\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281s] (listen)) is a city in Belgium and the capital of Antwerp province in the Flemish Region. With a population of 520,504, it is the most populous city proper in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people, it is the second largest metropolitan region after Brussels.Antwerp is on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe and within the top 20 globally. The city is also known for its diamond industry and trade.\nBoth economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt. Antwerp was also the place of the world's oldest stock exchange building, originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872.The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren (Dutch pronunciation: [s\u026a\u0272\u02c8jo\u02d0r\u0259(n)]), after the Spanish honorific se\u00f1or or French seigneur, \"lord\", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century. The city hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is New Latin.A Germanic (Frankish or Frisian) origin could contain prefix anda (\u201cagainst\u201d) and a noun derived from the verb werpen (\u201cto throw\u201d) and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit; a mound (like a terp) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf. If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean \"those who live on both banks\".There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river. He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt.\n\n\n=== Pre-1500 ===\nHistorical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952\u20131961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. The earliest mention of Antwerp dates from the 4th century.\nIn the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks.The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II, a border province facing the County of Flanders.\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon,  was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nAfter the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant, grew in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly enslaved Africans as the century progressed. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544\u20131574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became \"the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height.\" Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the \"Age of Exploration\". During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps.  Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas\".\n\nWithout a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venetian Republic, Republic of Ragusa, Spain and Portugal.  Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \"To the merchants of all nations.\" Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers.  In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth.  Numerous financial bankruptcies  began around 1557. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nThe religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries. The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury: 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over \u00a32 million sterling of damage was done.\n\n\n=== Dutch revolt ===\nSubsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa, and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock) and an access- lock and mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.\n\nIn 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chass\u00e9. For a time Chass\u00e9 subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass\u00e9 made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi)  from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAntwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During World War I, the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Li\u00e8ge. The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.\nAntwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. \nDuring World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote, V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic) Orthodox Judaism.\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into nine entities (districts):\n\nAntwerp\nBerchem\nBerendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo\nBorgerhout\nDeurne\nEkeren\nHoboken\nMerksem\nWilrijkIn 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp, the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.\n\n\n== Buildings and landmarks ==\n\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was noted for the wealth of its citizens (\"Antwerpia nummis\"). The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the Hanseatic League on the northern quays, in 1891. During World War II, the city also suffered considerable damage from V-bombs, and in recent years, other noteworthy buildings have been demolished for new developments.\n\nAntwerp Zoo opened in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the world.\nAntwerp City Hall dates from 1565, and is built primarily in Renaissance style.\nAntwerp Central Station is a railway station designed by Louis Delacenserie which was completed in 1905.\nCathedral of Our Lady. This church was begun in the 14th century and finished in 1518. The church has four works by Rubens, viz. \"The Descent from the Cross\", \"The Elevation of the Cross\", \"The Resurrection of Christ\" and \"The Assumption\"\nSt. James' Church, is more ornate than the cathedral. It contains the remains of numerous famous nobles, among them a major part of the family of Rubens.\nThe Church of St. Paul has a baroque interior. It is a few hundred yards north of the Grote Markt\nSt. Andrew's Church\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church\nMuseum Vleeshuis (Butchers' Hall) is a fine Gothic brick-built building, situated a short distance to the North-West of the Grote Markt.\nPlantin-Moretus Museum preserves the house of the printer Christoffel Plantijn and his successor Jan Moretus\nThe Saint-Boniface Church is an Anglican church and headseat of the archdeanery North-West Europe.\nBoerentoren (Farmers' Tower) or KBC Tower, a 26-storey building built in 1932, is the oldest skyscraper in Europe. It is the tallest building in Antwerp and the second tallest structure after the Cathedral of our Lady. The building was designed by Emiel van Averbeke, R. Van Hoenacker and Jos Smolderen.\nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts\nMuseum Mayer van den Bergh, with works from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nRubenshuis is the former home and studio of Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) in Antwerp. It is now a museum.\nRockox House is the former 17th-century Residence of Nicolaas II Rockox, lord Mayor of Antwerp.\nBourse of Antwerp. Originally built 1531; extensively restored 1872; now Antwerp Trade Fair.\nPalace of Justice, designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006. This building is the antithesis of the heavy, dark court building, designed by Joseph Poelaert, which dominates the skyline of Brussels. The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built on the site of the old Zuid (\"South\") station, at the end of a magnificent 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12). The building's highest 'sail' is 51 m (167 ft) high, has a floor area of 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft), and cost \u20ac130 million.\nZurenborg, a late-19th-century Belle \u00c9poque neighbourhood, on the border of Antwerp and Berchem, with many Art Nouveau architectural elements. The area counts as one of the most original Belle \u00c9poque urban expansion areas in Europe.\nMuseum aan de Stroom\nDen Botaniek or Antwerp's Botanical Garden, created in 1825. Located in the city centre, at the Leopoldstraat, it covers an area of almost 1 hectare.\nHarmonium Art museuM, a museum on pump organs in Klein-Willebroek\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (M HKA)\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\n\nAlthough Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former enceinte, only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. A replica of a castle named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais in the 19th century.\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:\n\n10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch\n12th and 13th century: canals (so called \"vlieten\" and \"ruien\") were made\n16th century: Spanish fortifications\n19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications\n20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\nThis is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.\n\n\n=== Minorities ===\nIn 2010, 36% to 39% of the inhabitants of Antwerp had a migrant background. A study projects that in 2020, 55% of the population will be of migrant background.\n\n\n==== Jewish community ====\n\nAfter The Holocaust and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic, live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff  (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk, based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Ger, Skver, Klausenburg, Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\n==== Jain community ====\n\nThe Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business. Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds. A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk).  Mr Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a full-fledged member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nThere are significant Armenian communities that reside in Antwerp, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with a smaller numbers are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church.\nOne of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel and involved in is the diamond trade business, that based primarily in the diamond district. Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nAccording to the American Association of Port Authorities, the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014\u20132020.  The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.\n\n\n=== Diamonds ===\nAntwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion. The city has four diamond bourses: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers. Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian and Maronite Christian from Lebanon and Armenian, traders become increasingly important.Antwerp World Diamond Centre, (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry. However, in recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nA six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to Brussels, Hasselt and Li\u00e8ge, Ghent, Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"Oosterweelconnection\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to Amsterdam and Paris, and national trains to Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Brussels, Charleroi, Hasselt, Li\u00e8ge, Leuven and Turnhout.\nAntwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald's haunting novel Austerlitz. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"premetro\" and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nA small airport, Antwerp International Airport, is located in the district of Deurne, with passenger service to various European destinations. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre.\nThe now defunct VLM Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport. This office is also CityJet's Antwerp office. When VG Airlines (Delsey Airlines) existed, its head office was located in the district of Merksem.Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport, is about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.\nThere is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs twice every hour on working days.\nThe runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.\nIn September 2019 Air Antwerp began operations with their first route to London City Airport with old VLM Airlines Fokker 50's.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections.\nThe current majority consists of N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld, led by mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA).\n\n\n=== Former mayors ===\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century important mayors include Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Nicolaas II Rockox.\nIn the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti\u00e8ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (New Flemish Alliance).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntwerp has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) similar to that of Southern England, while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) average highs for both July and August. Winters are more dominated by the maritime currents instead, with temps being heavily moderated.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAntwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its school of painting, which included Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the Teniers and many others.\n\nInformally, most Antverpians (in Dutch Antwerpenaren, people from Antwerp) speak Antverpian daily (in Dutch Antwerps), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other Brabantic dialects for its characteristic pronunciation of vowels: an 'aw' sound approximately like that in 'bore' is used for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the 'a' in 'hat'. The Echt Antwaarps Teater (\"Authentic Antverpian Theatre\") brings the dialect on stage.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nAntwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in the world. It has served as the learning centre for many Belgian fashion designers. Since the 1980s, several graduates of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts have become internationally successful fashion designers in Antwerp. The city has had a huge influence on other Belgian fashion designers such as Raf Simons, Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Theyskens and Kris Van Assche.\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nAntwerp is famous for its local products. In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally \"Antwerp Hands\". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.\n\n\n=== Missions to seafarers ===\nA number of Christian missions to seafarers are based in Antwerp, notably on the Itali\u00eblei. These include the Mission to Seafarers, British & International Sailors' Society, the Finnish Seamen's Mission, the Norwegian Sj\u00f8mannskirken and the Apostleship of the Sea. They provide cafeterias, cultural and social activities as well as religious services.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAntwerp is the home of the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC), founded in 1938 and located on the square Grote Markt since 1994.The band dEUS was formed in 1991 in Antwerp. dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material. Their musical influences range from folk and punk to jazz and progressive rock.\n\n\n=== Music festivals ===\nCultuurmarkt van Vlaanderen is a musical festival and a touristic attraction that takes place annually on the final Sunday of August in the city center of Antwerp. Where international and local musicians and actors, present their stage and street performances.Linkerwoofer is a pop-rock music festival located at the left bank of the Scheldt. This music festival starts in August and mostly local Belgian musicians play and perform in this event.Other popular festivals Fire Is Gold, and focuses more on urban music, and Summerfestival.\n\n\n=== World Choir Games ===\nThe city of Antwerp will co-host the 2020 World Choir Games together with the city of Ghent. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAntwerp held the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were the first games after the First World War and also the only ones to be held in Belgium. The road cycling events took place in the streets of the city.Royal Antwerp F.C., currently playing in the Belgian First Division, were founded in 1880 and is known as 'The Great Old' for being the first club registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1895. Since 1998, the club has taken Manchester United players on loan in an official partnership. Another club in the city was Beerschot VAC, founded in 1899 by former Royal Antwerp players. They played at the Olympisch Stadion, the main venue of the 1920 Olympics. Nowadays KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk plays at the Olympisch Stadion in the Belgian Second Division.\nThe Antwerp Giants play in Basketball League Belgium and Topvolley Antwerpen play in the Belgium men's volleyball League.\nFor the year 2013, Antwerp was awarded the title of European Capital of Sport.\nAntwerp hosted the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nAntwerp hosted the start of stage 3 of the 2015 Tour de France on 6 July 2015.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\nAntwerp has a university and several colleges. The University of Antwerp  (Universiteit Antwerpen) was established in 2003, following the merger of the RUCA, UFSIA and UIA institutes. Their roots go back to 1852. The University has approximately 23,000 registered students, making it the third-largest university in Flanders, as well as 1,800 foreign students.

        "wiki": "The Antwerp diamond heist, dubbed the \"heist of the century\", was one of the largest robberies in history. Thieves stole loose diamonds, gold, silver and other type of jewelry valued at more than $100 million. It took place in Antwerp, Belgium, during the weekend of 15\u201316 February 2003. Though arrests were made and time was served, most of the diamonds stolen remain unrecovered.\n\n\n== Site ==\nThe vault that housed the diamonds is situated two floors below the main floor. It was protected by multiple security mechanisms, including a lock with 100 million possible combinations, infrared heat detectors, a seismic sensor, Doppler radar, and a magnetic field. The building itself had a private security force.\n\n\n== Robbery ==\nLeonardo Notarbartolo had rented a sparsely furnished office for approximately 25,000 Belgian francs ($700) per month in the Antwerp World Diamond Centre. This was a technique pioneered by New York City-based Serbian criminal authority \"Mr. Stan\", Vojislav Stanimirovi\u0107. It was first accomplished in New York's diamond center many years prior to this robbery. It included creating access to the safe deposit box located in the vault beneath the building. The method also provided a tenant ID card offering 24-hour access to the building. There, he posed as an Italian diamond merchant in order to gain credibility. The robbery required eighteen months of preparation. The group used a variety of ingenious methods to overcome the security systems and left investigators confused as to how they had managed to successfully gain entry without triggering the security systems:\nThe group conducted detailed surveillance of the Diamond Centre, using camera pens for taking pictures of the centre and the vault covertly. Notarbartolo's frequent visits, under the guise of being a diamond merchant, caused security to become used to his presence and thus lax.\nA small camera was hidden above the vault door by the group, being difficult to see when the ceiling lights were on. It would observe guards opening the door and record the combination he used. It would then broadcast its data to sensor, which the group had hidden inside a ordinary-looking red fire extinguisher in a nearby storage room in the centre (the extinguisher was fully functional but had a watertight chamber hidden inside it which housed electronics to receive the camera's data).\nThe group allegedly practised with a full-scale replica of the vault (Notarbartolo claims this was produced with help from a diamond trader insider)\nThe day before the robbery, Notarbartolo visited the vault, posing as a routine visit. While inside, he quickly sprayed women's hair spray on the thermal-motion sensors (having practised the necessary motion for a swift spray), as the oil from the product was transparent but would temporarily insulate the sensor from thermal fluctuations in the room and the sensor would only go off if it detected both heat and motion. This would last many hours but not forever and the group used it as a temporary measure until they could properly disable the sensor system. While the security camera recorded his actions, the guard was used to his visits and was not paying attention.\nNotarbartolo remained in a nearby getaway vehicle during the robbery, listening to a police scanner and prepared to leave as soon as the group was done.\nThe team wore plastic gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints.\nTo avoid the large number of security cameras in the area around the bank, the King of Keys picked the lock to an abandoned office building that adjoined the Diamond Centre, as it shared a private garden with the Diamond Centre that wasn't under video surveillance.\nThe garden allowed access to a small balcony on the centre, which the group accessed via ladder. An infrared sensor monitored the terrace but the Genius used a large, homemade polyester shield to hide his thermal signature as he approached the sensor and placed the shield in front of it, preventing it from detecting the group. He then disabled an alarm on the balcony's windows.\nSecurity cameras in the antechamber were covered with black plastic bags to allow the group to turn on the lights.\nThe vault door had a magnetic lock on it that consisted of two plates - when armed, they would trigger a magnetic field and when the door opened, the field would break, triggering an alarm. The Genius overcome this by using a custom made aluminium plate, to which he attached heavy-duty double-sided tape to one side of it. He then stuck it on the two bolts and unscrewed them. While they were lose from their proper position, they were still side by side and generating a magnetic field. They were pivoted out of the way and taped to the antechamber wall.\nThe King of Keys had used video footage to successfully make a duplicate of the almost impossible to duplicate, foot-long vault key. However, during the robbery, he knew that guards often visited the utility room just before opening the door and decided to investigate. Inside the unlocked room he found the vault key. He decided to steal the original key, as it would ensure the vault's manufacturers did not realise the key could be duplicated and indeed, it was not until Notarbartolo revealed this occurred that the police would know a duplicate had been created. The group turned off the antechamber lights before opening the vault door to avoid tripping light sensors in the vault\nAfter the King of Keys picked the lock to the internal gate, the Monster, working in darkness, moved to the middle of the room (having practised the number of steps in the replica), reached up to the ceiling and pushed back a panel, locating the security systems inbound and outbound wires. An electric pulse shot along these wires and if any sensor was tripped or broken, the circuit would break and trigger the alarm. To overcome this, the Monster carefully stripped the wire's plastic coating and attached a piece of new wire to the exposed copper wiring, rerouting the circuit and ensuring that it was irrelevant if the sensors were tripped.\nHeat sensors were blinded with Styrofoam boxes and light sensors with tape. The men worked in darkness, having memorised the layout of the vault. They would occasionally flick on their lights for a brief moment in order to position their drill over the lock boxes.\nThe King of Keys used a hand cranked drill to break the locks on each of the security boxes. The contents were then emptied into duffel bags.\nAt 5:30am they finished and left, returning to the office building (a process which took almost an hour due to the need for caution). They then put the bags in Notarbartolo's car, which then drove to the apartment while the men headed there on foot.The group was caught after Notarbartolo and Speedy went to dispose of the evidence of their plans, planning to burn it in France. Speedy was overcome with panic at the prospect of transporting such incriminating evidence and insisted they dispose of it in a nearby forest. However, Speedy suffered a panic-attack and disposed of the evidence poorly, hurling it into the bushes and mud rather than burning it. Notarbartolo was busy burning his own evidence and when he discovered what Speedy had done, he decided it would take too long to gather everything up and they needed to leave, confident that nobody would find their rubbish. However, a local hunter owned the land and called the police when he found the rubbish the next day (believing it to be caused by local teenagers he had previously had disputes with). When he mentioned that some of the rubbish consisted of envelopes from the Antwerp Diamond Centre, the police immediately investigated. The evidence from the rubbish was enough to allow the police to gain a lead and they were eventually able to identify Notarbartolo from security footage from a nearby grocery store where he had purchased a sandwich (a receipt for the sandwich was amongst the rubbish).After the robbery, Notarbartolo and his team stole the security footage to conceal their identities. More than 123 out of 160 safe deposit boxes were forced open, each of which was made of steel and copper and had both a key lock and combination lock.\n\n\n== Perpetrators ==\nThe theft was carried out by a five-man team led by Leonardo Notarbartolo, a professional thief who was skilled in social manipulation. Notarbartolo had rented space in the diamond district, and was arrested after being connected to the crime by DNA evidence from a partially eaten salami sandwich found near the crime scene.In addition to Notarbartolo, the team consisted of at least four other members, whom Notarbartolo gave aliases during interviews, though he refused to specify whom each alias referred to:\nSpeedy - described as an anxious and paranoid man, he was a long-time friend of Notarbartolo and was the one responsible for scattering the rubbish in the woods. Most likely the alias of Pietro Tavano.\nThe Monster - described as a tall, muscular man, he was apparently an expert lockpicker, electrician, mechanic and driver and was very strong. Most likely the alias of Ferdinando Finotto.\nThe Genius - a specialist in alarm systems. Most likely the alias of Elio D'Onorio, an electronics expert known to be linked to series of robberies.\nThe King of Keys - an older man, he was described as one of the best key forgers in the world. His true identity is unknown and he remains the only member of the crew to escape apprehension by the police.Notarbartolo was found guilty of orchestrating the heist. He is considered to be the leader of a ring of Italian thieves called \"La Scuola di Torino\" (The School of Turin), who carried out the crime. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the court of appeal of Antwerp in 2005, but had since been released on parole in 2009. In 2011 a European Arrest Warrant was issued against him after he was found to have violated his parole conditions. One of these conditions was that he needed to compensate the victims of the heist, which he never made any attempt at. As a consequence, he was arrested again in 2013 at the Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris during a layover from the United States to Turin, and was made to serve the remainder of his prison sentence until 2017.\n\n\n== Insurance fraud ==\nNotarbartolo claimed in an interview with Wired magazine that a diamond merchant hired them for the heist. He claims that they actually stole approximately \u20ac18 million ($20 million) worth of loot, and that the robbery was part of an insurance fraud.Due to the fact that the vault itself was uninsured, as the insurance company realised the security flaws and would have never given it an insurance policy, there was actually very little insurance money involved, which casts doubt on his story.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe heist is the subject of the book Flawless: Inside the Largest Diamond Heist in History by Scott Andrew Selby and Greg Campbell.The story of this diamond heist was featured on The Travel Channel's \u201cMysteries At The Museum\u201d Season 16/Episode 4 titled \u201cProject Vortex, Diamond Heist and Tinseltown, NJ\u201d, narrated by series host Don Wildman.\nParamount Pictures optioned the rights to create a film about the heist, which have since expired. It was to be produced by J.J. Abrams.Edgar Award-winning true crime author Burl Barer is collaborating with the other perpetrators and individuals from the \"School of Turin\", writing about what really transpired and how much was really taken. It will be released as a True Crime Series, 2018.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSchiphol Airport diamond heist, took place in 2005 with an estimated \u20ac75 million ($118 million) stolen\n2015 Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary, a jewel theft in London with \u00a314m in value stolen\n2013 Belgium diamond heist\n\n\n== References ==",

          "always at least one good show. good art house movies too. Front of house staff rather hostile and uneducated, but that should not stop you.",
          "We visited on a whim, at the time of the Saul Leiter expo and the Rik & Herman Selleslags expo. Both were constructed pretty well in our opinion: there was a clear narrative in both expositions, and the evolution of the artists' works was very well documented. This way the",
          "The FOMU was a very cool experience and a great option to go to as an individual or with friends. During my visit not all of the exhibits were open due to the transitioning to a new exhibit, so that was a bit disappointing, but what was available to see was very interesting,",
          "An place with always interesting exhibitions, a reference for people interested in art photography. To visit on a regular basis.",
          "Photo exhibitions are just not appealing to me. I've seen them in Tate, London, in FOAM Amsterdam, in house Marseille in Amsterdam, and now also in Antwerp. I have yet to enter one that I find appealing. Still, congratulations to the photographer who managed to get a shoot with",
          "I didn't thoroughly enjoy visting this museum, because I am not really interested in this kind of art. However if you are interested in modern (photography) art, then I think you will like this place. The view from the 'rooftop' bar however is lovely and worth a visit aswell.",
          "The FOMU building is inspiring and worth the visit just to see the view from the top. The exhibitions are more educational and historic in nature. I was hoping to see more are on our tour. If you enjoy natural history/cultural museums, this would be a great experience. We",
          "The history of photography is wonderful. And as this museum have done it is worth going to see. My wife who is not into photography enjoyed it as well.",

          "I really liked the exhibitions, even if they were so different from each other. Any photography fan should visit.",
          "Wasn't too impressed by this gallery / museum, hardly anything of interest for me, my own personal taste of modern, contemporary wasn't there...lots of historic photos and education about photography, so good for kids.",
          "Fomu is located at the South edge of Antwerp, between restaurants and bars. The building makes for a nice walk but the real interest depends on the temporary exhibitions that are presented. The museum also includes a well stocked museaum shop, ideal for picking up a present.",
          "Until February 14th FOMU has two temporary photography exhibitions, one on German photographer August Sander (1876-1964) and one on the contemporary Dutch photographer Jan Hoek. There is also a third exhibition on the history of photography and the photographic industry. We",

          "To be honest, we came here only because it happened to be Antwerp's only museum open on Ascension Day. We wouldn't have even returned to the city from Brussels that day had we known so many places would be closed (and we checked websites in advance, but apparently they weren't",

        "wiki": "Antwerp Zoo (Dutch: ZOO Antwerpen) is a zoo in the centre of Antwerp, Belgium, located next to the Antwerpen-Centraal railway station. It is the oldest animal park in the country, and one of the oldest in the world, established on 21 July 1843.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSince its foundation, the park has been controlled by De Koninklijke Maatschappij voor Dierkunde van Antwerpen, a society originally called Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de Zoologie d'Anvers (The Antwerp Royal Society for Zoology). This also became the popular nickname for the zoo, \"De Zoologie\".  The initial objective was to encourage zoological and botanical sciences. Its first director was renowned zoologist and botanist Jacques Kets (10 November 1785 \u2013 1 February 1865). He accepted this position on one condition: a museum had to be built to house his nature-historical collections. This building was inaugurated in 1844 by H.M. King Leopold I. The predicate Royal was added to the name of the society on that occasion.\nThroughout the years, it has encouraged wildlife preservation through activities and exhibits on a recreational, educational, scientific, and cultural level.In its early years, the size of the park grew from less than 1.59 hectares (3.9 acres) to more than 10.5 hectares (26 acres). Notable buildings from that period are the Egyptian temple (1856) and the antelope building (1861) in Oriental style, which now houses the okapis.The zoo has also a cultural function. Originally, concerts were held in the garden of the zoo. The museum building was demolished to build a concert hall. The hall then became the residence of the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra, the symphonic orchestra  of Flanders. The museum collections were moved to the second floor..\nFor the 1920 Summer Olympics, the venue hosted the boxing and wrestling events.After World War II, the animal park was turned into a model zoo which conformed to new and modern scientific, educational, cultural and aesthetic standards. The animal compounds were enlarged and admitted more light. Buildings from this period include the primate building (1958) and the big jubileum complex, established on the occasion of the 125-year anniversary together with the nocturama (1968), which houses the nocturnal animals. The jubileum complex houses birds of prey and the sea lions. In 1973 a new compound for reptilians was built, and in 1978 a new building for smaller species of monkeys. The older primate building was renovated in 1989. To support its educational mission, the zoo started with group tours and special educational programmes called zoo classes in 1969. Around the same time, planetarium exhibits were installed.On 1 January 1983, the animal park was classified as a monument. Ten years later, its 150th anniversary was celebrated. In 1997, Vriesland (Freezeland) was opened. It houses subantarctic penguins and in the past also Alaskan sea otters. In spring 1999, the elephant compound was expanded. In 2003, many animals, including hippos, Malayan tapirs, and a number of swamp birds received a new home in Hippotopia.\n\n\n== Animals and exhibits ==\n\nTogether with its sister park Planckendael, Antwerp Zoo houses over 7,000 animals of about 950 species.  Over 1.6 million people visit the zoo and Planckendael each year, and the zoo has around 200,000 supporting members.Some exhibits and species in the park include:\n\nVriesland with king penguins, macaroni penguins, and gentoo penguins. A couple of sea otters has also lived here, but they were replaced by seals after the last one died.\nAquaforum with California sea lions, used to house bottlenose dolphins up to 1999.\nReptile house, renovated in  2005 with many species of snakes, lizards, turtles, and frogs, as well as caimans\nThe over a century old renovated aquarium, with renovations completed in 2015, housing many species of saltwater and freshwater fish\nNocturama with aardvarks, tamanduas, two-toed sloths, night monkeys, armadillos, slender lorises, lesser mouse-deer, rakalis, Philippine mouse-deer and Egyptian fruit bats\nSavannah aviary with African buffalos and several bird species including guineafowl, ibises and Abdim's storks\nEgyptian temple with Asian elephants, Hartmann's mountain zebras and giraffes,\nAviaries and bird house with many birds species including military macaws, turacos, toucans, peafowls, pheasants and a large collection of Songbirds.\nHippotopia with hippopotamus, malayan tapirs, dalmatian pelicans, Coypu and a couple of bird species\nBearcanyon with spectacled bears, and coatis\nCat enclosures with Amur leopard, lion and jaguar\nFlemish garden\nKangaroo house with koalas and a tree-kangaroo\nMoorish temple with Okapis\nMonkey house with guereza, owl-faced monkey, javan lutung, emperor tamarin, black-headed spider monkey, golden-headed lion tamarin, pygmy marmoset, mandrill, Ring-tailed lemur and Black Lemur\nApe house with chimpanzees, western lowland gorillas and the world's only eastern lowland gorilla in captivity outside of Africa.\nBirds of prey including snowy owl, spectacled owl, crested caracara, Kea and several vultures\nOther enclosures featuring harbour seal, bongo, meerkat, red panda, North American porcupine, American flamingo and African penguinAll the animals in the zoo and Planckendael combined consume about 41 tons of fish, 52 tons of meat, 37 tons of apples, 36 tons of carrots, 128 tons of hay, 4,000 litres of milk, 23,000 eggs, and 10,000 loaves of bread.\nThe zoo used to have a dolphinarium called the Aquaforum. At the time of its building, one of the most modern of its kind. Over the years, however, the infrastructure was considered far too small and dated. The zoo's urban location prevented any expansion and meant the society could not build a new one. In 1999 the two dolphins were relocated to the Duisburg Zoo in Germany because of the new national standards for exhibits, with the exhibit too shallow to keep housing dolphins. The Aquaforum now hold sea lions, which are much less demanding.\nList of animals of Zoo Antwerp\n\n\n== Architecture and garden ==\n\nAntwerp Zoo is one of the oldest zoos in the world, established in 1843. Many buildings are very well preserved.\nSome of them have received new functions throughout the years.\n\nEntrance of the zoo (1843)\nEgyptian temple (1856)\nMoor temple (1885): it still houses okapis. Antwerp Zoo became the world's first zoo with okapis in 1918.\nBird building (1948)\nNocturama (1968)\nReptile building (1901): this building looks like a Greek temple.\nAquarium (1910): designed by Emile Thielens.\nWinter garden (1897): a tropical greenhouse.On January 1, 1983, the entire park (architecture and garden) was listed as a monument.\n\n\n== Breeding programmes ==\nAntwerp Zoo has played its role in preservation and breeding programmes for several endangered species, including  the okapi, the Przewalski horse, the Congo peafowl, the bonobo, the golden-headed lion tamarin, the European otter, and the Knysna seahorse. They take part in the European Endangered Species Programme.\n\n\n== Centre for Research and Conservation (CRC) ==\nThe Centre for Research and Conservation is an important research department of the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp. The CRC is not a separate research institute, but is very much embedded in the structure and functioning of the society. Research takes place at Antwerp Zoo, at the Wild Animal Park Planckendael, in other zoos and associated institutions, in situ in Cameroon with the Projet Grands Singes, in Brazil with BioBrasil, and in the RZSA's own wetland nature reserve \"De Zegge\" in Belgium. For all research fields, the CRC combines strictly zoo-related research and fundamental research, and reports to scientists in peer reviewed journals as well as to the general public. The conservation of wildlife and their natural habitat is very important for the CRC. The centre also receives money from the Flemish Government. In 2006 the Centre for Research and Conservation of Antwerp Zoo has won the EAZA Research Award.\n\n\n== Affiliated parks and domains ==\nIn 1952, the society in control of the zoo bought the nature preserve De Zegge in Geel, because nature preservation is an important part of its mission statement. It is an area that spans 96 hectares (240 acres) and receives international wildlife protection.\nIn 1956, the same society bought the Domein Planckendael in Muizen, near Mechelen. It covers an area of 40 hectares (99 acres) and has become a full-grown animal park.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Dutch and French)\nWebsite of domain Planckendael (in Dutch and French)\nCenter for Research and Conservation",

        "wiki": "Antwerp ( (listen); Dutch: Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen); French: Anvers [\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281s] (listen)) is a city in Belgium and the capital of Antwerp province in the Flemish Region. With a population of 520,504, it is the most populous city proper in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people, it is the second largest metropolitan region after Brussels.Antwerp is on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe and within the top 20 globally. The city is also known for its diamond industry and trade.\nBoth economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt. Antwerp was also the place of the world's oldest stock exchange building, originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872.The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren (Dutch pronunciation: [s\u026a\u0272\u02c8jo\u02d0r\u0259(n)]), after the Spanish honorific se\u00f1or or French seigneur, \"lord\", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century. The city hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is New Latin.A Germanic (Frankish or Frisian) origin could contain prefix anda (\u201cagainst\u201d) and a noun derived from the verb werpen (\u201cto throw\u201d) and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit; a mound (like a terp) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf. If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean \"those who live on both banks\".There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river. He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt.\n\n\n=== Pre-1500 ===\nHistorical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952\u20131961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. The earliest mention of Antwerp dates from the 4th century.\nIn the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks.The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II, a border province facing the County of Flanders.\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon,  was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nAfter the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant, grew in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly enslaved Africans as the century progressed. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544\u20131574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became \"the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height.\" Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the \"Age of Exploration\". During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps.  Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas\".\n\nWithout a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venetian Republic, Republic of Ragusa, Spain and Portugal.  Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \"To the merchants of all nations.\" Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers.  In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth.  Numerous financial bankruptcies  began around 1557. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nThe religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries. The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury: 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over \u00a32 million sterling of damage was done.\n\n\n=== Dutch revolt ===\nSubsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa, and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock) and an access- lock and mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.\n\nIn 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chass\u00e9. For a time Chass\u00e9 subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass\u00e9 made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi)  from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAntwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During World War I, the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Li\u00e8ge. The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.\nAntwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. \nDuring World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote, V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic) Orthodox Judaism.\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into nine entities (districts):\n\nAntwerp\nBerchem\nBerendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo\nBorgerhout\nDeurne\nEkeren\nHoboken\nMerksem\nWilrijkIn 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp, the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.\n\n\n== Buildings and landmarks ==\n\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was noted for the wealth of its citizens (\"Antwerpia nummis\"). The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the Hanseatic League on the northern quays, in 1891. During World War II, the city also suffered considerable damage from V-bombs, and in recent years, other noteworthy buildings have been demolished for new developments.\n\nAntwerp Zoo opened in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the world.\nAntwerp City Hall dates from 1565, and is built primarily in Renaissance style.\nAntwerp Central Station is a railway station designed by Louis Delacenserie which was completed in 1905.\nCathedral of Our Lady. This church was begun in the 14th century and finished in 1518. The church has four works by Rubens, viz. \"The Descent from the Cross\", \"The Elevation of the Cross\", \"The Resurrection of Christ\" and \"The Assumption\"\nSt. James' Church, is more ornate than the cathedral. It contains the remains of numerous famous nobles, among them a major part of the family of Rubens.\nThe Church of St. Paul has a baroque interior. It is a few hundred yards north of the Grote Markt\nSt. Andrew's Church\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church\nMuseum Vleeshuis (Butchers' Hall) is a fine Gothic brick-built building, situated a short distance to the North-West of the Grote Markt.\nPlantin-Moretus Museum preserves the house of the printer Christoffel Plantijn and his successor Jan Moretus\nThe Saint-Boniface Church is an Anglican church and headseat of the archdeanery North-West Europe.\nBoerentoren (Farmers' Tower) or KBC Tower, a 26-storey building built in 1932, is the oldest skyscraper in Europe. It is the tallest building in Antwerp and the second tallest structure after the Cathedral of our Lady. The building was designed by Emiel van Averbeke, R. Van Hoenacker and Jos Smolderen.\nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts\nMuseum Mayer van den Bergh, with works from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nRubenshuis is the former home and studio of Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) in Antwerp. It is now a museum.\nRockox House is the former 17th-century Residence of Nicolaas II Rockox, lord Mayor of Antwerp.\nBourse of Antwerp. Originally built 1531; extensively restored 1872; now Antwerp Trade Fair.\nPalace of Justice, designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006. This building is the antithesis of the heavy, dark court building, designed by Joseph Poelaert, which dominates the skyline of Brussels. The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built on the site of the old Zuid (\"South\") station, at the end of a magnificent 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12). The building's highest 'sail' is 51 m (167 ft) high, has a floor area of 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft), and cost \u20ac130 million.\nZurenborg, a late-19th-century Belle \u00c9poque neighbourhood, on the border of Antwerp and Berchem, with many Art Nouveau architectural elements. The area counts as one of the most original Belle \u00c9poque urban expansion areas in Europe.\nMuseum aan de Stroom\nDen Botaniek or Antwerp's Botanical Garden, created in 1825. Located in the city centre, at the Leopoldstraat, it covers an area of almost 1 hectare.\nHarmonium Art museuM, a museum on pump organs in Klein-Willebroek\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (M HKA)\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\n\nAlthough Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former enceinte, only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. A replica of a castle named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais in the 19th century.\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:\n\n10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch\n12th and 13th century: canals (so called \"vlieten\" and \"ruien\") were made\n16th century: Spanish fortifications\n19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications\n20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\nThis is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.\n\n\n=== Minorities ===\nIn 2010, 36% to 39% of the inhabitants of Antwerp had a migrant background. A study projects that in 2020, 55% of the population will be of migrant background.\n\n\n==== Jewish community ====\n\nAfter The Holocaust and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic, live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff  (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk, based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Ger, Skver, Klausenburg, Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\n==== Jain community ====\n\nThe Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business. Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds. A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk).  Mr Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a full-fledged member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nThere are significant Armenian communities that reside in Antwerp, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with a smaller numbers are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church.\nOne of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel and involved in is the diamond trade business, that based primarily in the diamond district. Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nAccording to the American Association of Port Authorities, the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014\u20132020.  The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.\n\n\n=== Diamonds ===\nAntwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion. The city has four diamond bourses: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers. Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian and Maronite Christian from Lebanon and Armenian, traders become increasingly important.Antwerp World Diamond Centre, (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry. However, in recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nA six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to Brussels, Hasselt and Li\u00e8ge, Ghent, Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"Oosterweelconnection\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to Amsterdam and Paris, and national trains to Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Brussels, Charleroi, Hasselt, Li\u00e8ge, Leuven and Turnhout.\nAntwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald's haunting novel Austerlitz. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"premetro\" and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nA small airport, Antwerp International Airport, is located in the district of Deurne, with passenger service to various European destinations. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre.\nThe now defunct VLM Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport. This office is also CityJet's Antwerp office. When VG Airlines (Delsey Airlines) existed, its head office was located in the district of Merksem.Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport, is about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.\nThere is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs twice every hour on working days.\nThe runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.\nIn September 2019 Air Antwerp began operations with their first route to London City Airport with old VLM Airlines Fokker 50's.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections.\nThe current majority consists of N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld, led by mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA).\n\n\n=== Former mayors ===\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century important mayors include Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Nicolaas II Rockox.\nIn the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti\u00e8ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (New Flemish Alliance).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntwerp has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) similar to that of Southern England, while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) average highs for both July and August. Winters are more dominated by the maritime currents instead, with temps being heavily moderated.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAntwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its school of painting, which included Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the Teniers and many others.\n\nInformally, most Antverpians (in Dutch Antwerpenaren, people from Antwerp) speak Antverpian daily (in Dutch Antwerps), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other Brabantic dialects for its characteristic pronunciation of vowels: an 'aw' sound approximately like that in 'bore' is used for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the 'a' in 'hat'. The Echt Antwaarps Teater (\"Authentic Antverpian Theatre\") brings the dialect on stage.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nAntwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in the world. It has served as the learning centre for many Belgian fashion designers. Since the 1980s, several graduates of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts have become internationally successful fashion designers in Antwerp. The city has had a huge influence on other Belgian fashion designers such as Raf Simons, Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Theyskens and Kris Van Assche.\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nAntwerp is famous for its local products. In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally \"Antwerp Hands\". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.\n\n\n=== Missions to seafarers ===\nA number of Christian missions to seafarers are based in Antwerp, notably on the Itali\u00eblei. These include the Mission to Seafarers, British & International Sailors' Society, the Finnish Seamen's Mission, the Norwegian Sj\u00f8mannskirken and the Apostleship of the Sea. They provide cafeterias, cultural and social activities as well as religious services.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAntwerp is the home of the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC), founded in 1938 and located on the square Grote Markt since 1994.The band dEUS was formed in 1991 in Antwerp. dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material. Their musical influences range from folk and punk to jazz and progressive rock.\n\n\n=== Music festivals ===\nCultuurmarkt van Vlaanderen is a musical festival and a touristic attraction that takes place annually on the final Sunday of August in the city center of Antwerp. Where international and local musicians and actors, present their stage and street performances.Linkerwoofer is a pop-rock music festival located at the left bank of the Scheldt. This music festival starts in August and mostly local Belgian musicians play and perform in this event.Other popular festivals Fire Is Gold, and focuses more on urban music, and Summerfestival.\n\n\n=== World Choir Games ===\nThe city of Antwerp will co-host the 2020 World Choir Games together with the city of Ghent. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAntwerp held the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were the first games after the First World War and also the only ones to be held in Belgium. The road cycling events took place in the streets of the city.Royal Antwerp F.C., currently playing in the Belgian First Division, were founded in 1880 and is known as 'The Great Old' for being the first club registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1895. Since 1998, the club has taken Manchester United players on loan in an official partnership. Another club in the city was Beerschot VAC, founded in 1899 by former Royal Antwerp players. They played at the Olympisch Stadion, the main venue of the 1920 Olympics. Nowadays KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk plays at the Olympisch Stadion in the Belgian Second Division.\nThe Antwerp Giants play in Basketball League Belgium and Topvolley Antwerpen play in the Belgium men's volleyball League.\nFor the year 2013, Antwerp was awarded the title of European Capital of Sport.\nAntwerp hosted the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nAntwerp hosted the start of stage 3 of the 2015 Tour de France on 6 July 2015.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\nAntwerp has a university and several colleges. The University of Antwerp  (Universiteit Antwerpen) was established in 2003, following the merger of the RUCA, UFSIA and UIA institutes. Their roots go back to 1852. The University has approximately 23,000 registered students, making it the third-largest university in Flanders, as well as 1,800 foreign students. It has 7 faculties, spread over four campus locations in the city centre and in the south of the city.\nThe city has several colleges, including Antwerp Management School (AMS), Charlemagne University College (Karel de Grote Hogeschool), Plantin University College (Plantijn Hogeschool), and Artesis University College (Artesis Hogeschool). Artesis University College has about 8,600 students and 1,600 staff, and Charlemagne University College has about 10,000 students and 1,300 staff. Plantin University College has approximately 3,700 students.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nThe following places are twinned with or sister cities to Antwerp:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Born in Antwerp ===\n\n\n=== Lived in Antwerp ===\n\n\n== Select neighbourhoods ==\nDen Dam \u2013 an area in northern Antwerp\nThe diamond district \u2013 an area consisting of several square blocks, it is Antwerp's centre for the cutting, polishing, and trading of diamonds\nLinkeroever \u2013 Antwerp on the left bank of the Scheldt with a lot of apartment buildings\nMeir \u2013 Antwerp's largest shopping street\nVan Wesenbekestraat \u2013 the city's Chinatown\nHet Zuid \u2013 the south of Antwerp, notable for its museums and Expo grounds\nZurenborg \u2013 an area between Central and Berchem station with a concentration of Art Nouveau townhouses\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntwerp Book Fair\nAntwerp lace\nAntwerp Water Works (AWW)\nJewish Community of Antwerp\nLetterenhuis\nList of mayors of Antwerp\nPshevorsk \u2013 Hassidic Jewish movement based in Antwerp\nRoyal Antwerp F.C., local football club\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nBlanchard, Ian.

        "wiki": "The Botanic Garden of Antwerp, which currently carries the name Den Botaniek (also sometimes locally called The Botanieken Court or herb garden), is a landscaped botanical garden created in 1825  in the inner city of Antwerp located at the Leopoldstraat, covering an area of slightly less than 1 hectare. Before that the park was, at the end of the 18th century, a plant garden for the Ecole Centrale and then the herb garden and later the vegetable garden of the Sint-Elisabethgasthuis.\nThe Garden in its present form was laid out by dokter Claude-Louis Somm\u00e9 and supported the lessons in external pathology at the \u00e9cole de m\u00e9decine, an education in medicine. The gardeners home in the park dates back to 1870 and the entrance gate, designed by Pierre Bruno Bourla to 1826. Burla also designed the Orangerie of the garden which is however no longer situated within the current area of the garden. The Orangerie contains busts of Linnaeus and de Jussieu and the names of De L'Escluse, De L'Obel, Van Sterbeeck, Dodoens and Dumortier on the facade.\nThe garden is managed by the City Council of Antwerp since 1926.Since januari 1950 the herb garden is a protected landscape. The garden holds a collection of 2.000 plants, with in the Conservatory some cacti and other exotic plants. The garden is open daily, the Conservatory remains closed on Sundays. Entrance is free.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Kristallnacht (German pronunciation: [k\u0281\u026as\u02c8talna\u03c7t] (listen)) or the Night of Broken Glass, also called the November Pogrom(s), was a pogrom against Jews carried out by SA paramilitary forces and civilians throughout Nazi Germany on 9\u201310 November 1938. The German authorities looked on without intervening. The name Kristallnacht (\"Crystal Night\") comes from the shards of broken glass that littered the streets after the windows of Jewish-owned stores, buildings and synagogues were smashed. The pretext for the attacks was the assassination of the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by Herschel Grynszpan, a 17-year-old German-born Polish Jew living in Paris.\nJewish homes, hospitals and schools were ransacked as attackers demolished buildings with sledgehammers. Rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany, Austria and the Sudetenland. Over 7,000 Jewish businesses were damaged or destroyed, and 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and incarcerated in concentration camps. British historian Martin Gilbert wrote that no event in the history of German Jews between 1933 and 1945 was so widely reported as it was happening, and the accounts from foreign journalists working in Germany sent shockwaves around the world. The Times of London observed on 11 November 1938: \"No foreign propagandist bent upon blackening Germany before the world could outdo the tale of burnings and beatings, of blackguardly assaults on defenceless and innocent people, which disgraced that country yesterday.\"Estimates of fatalities caused by the attacks have varied. Early reports estimated that 91 Jews had been murdered. Modern analysis of German scholarly sources puts the figure much higher; when deaths from post-arrest maltreatment and subsequent suicides are included, the death toll reaches the hundreds, with Richard J. Evans estimating 638 deaths by suicide. Historians view Kristallnacht as a prelude to the Final Solution and the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Early Nazi persecutions ===\nIn the 1920s, most German Jews were fully integrated into German society as German citizens. They served in the German army and navy and contributed to every field of German business, science and culture. Conditions for German Jews began to change after the appointment of Adolf Hitler (the Austrian-born leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party) as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, and the Enabling Act (implemented 23 March 1933) which enabled the assumption of power by Hitler after the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933. From its inception, Hitler's r\u00e9gime moved quickly to introduce anti-Jewish policies. Nazi propaganda alienated 500,000 Jews in Germany, who accounted for only 0.86% of the overall population, and framed them as an enemy responsible for Germany's defeat in the First World War and for its subsequent economic disasters, such as the 1920s hyperinflation and Wall Street Crash Great Depression. Beginning in 1933, the German government enacted a series of anti-Jewish laws restricting the rights of German Jews to earn a living, to enjoy full citizenship and to gain education, including the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service of 7 April 1933, which forbade Jews to work in the civil service. The subsequent 1935 Nuremberg Laws stripped German Jews of their citizenship and prohibited Jews from marrying non-Jewish Germans.\nThese laws resulted in the exclusion and alienation of Jews from German social and political life. Many sought asylum abroad; hundreds of thousands emigrated, but as Chaim Weizmann wrote in 1936, \"The world seemed to be divided into two parts\u2014those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter.\" The international \u00c9vian Conference on 6 July 1938 addressed the issue of Jewish and Gypsy immigration to other countries. By the time the conference took place, more than 250,000 Jews had fled Germany and Austria, which had been annexed by Germany in March 1938; more than 300,000 German and Austrian Jews continued to seek refuge and asylum from oppression. As the number of Jews and Gypsies wanting to leave increased, the restrictions against them grew, with many countries tightening their rules for admission. By 1938, Germany \"had entered a new radical phase in anti-Semitic activity\". Some historians believe that the Nazi government had been contemplating a planned outbreak of violence against the Jews and were waiting for an appropriate provocation; there is evidence of this planning dating back to 1937. In a 1997 interview, the German historian Hans Mommsen claimed that a major motive for the pogrom was the desire of the Gauleiters of the NSDAP to seize Jewish property and businesses. Mommsen stated:\n\nThe need for money by the party organization stemmed from the fact that Franz Xaver Schwarz, the party treasurer, kept the local and regional organizations of the party short of money. In the fall of 1938, the increased pressure on Jewish property nourished the party's ambition, especially since Hjalmar Schacht had been ousted as Reich minister for economics. This, however, was only one aspect of the origin of the November 1938 pogrom. The Polish government threatened to extradite all Jews who were Polish citizens but would stay in Germany, thus creating a burden of responsibility on the German side. The immediate reaction by the Gestapo was to push the Polish Jews\u201416,000 persons\u2014over the borderline, but this measure failed due to the stubbornness of the Polish customs officers. The loss of prestige as a result of this abortive operation called for some sort of compensation. Thus, the overreaction to Herschel Grynszpan's attempt against the diplomat Ernst vom Rath came into being and led to the November pogrom. The background of the pogrom was signified by a sharp cleavage of interests between the different agencies of party and state. While the Nazi party was interested in improving its financial strength on the regional and local level by taking over Jewish property, Hermann G\u00f6ring, in charge of the Four-Year Plan, hoped to acquire access to foreign currency in order to pay for the import of urgently-needed raw material. Heydrich and Himmler were interested in fostering Jewish emigration. \nThe Zionist leadership in the British Mandate of Palestine wrote in February 1938 that according to \"a very reliable private source\u2014one which can be traced back to the highest echelons of the SS leadership\", there was \"an intention to carry out a genuine and dramatic pogrom in Germany on a large scale in the near future\".\n\n\n=== Expulsion of Polish Jews in Germany ===\n\nIn August 1938, German authorities announced that residence permits for foreigners were being canceled and would have to be renewed. This included German-born Jews of foreign citizenship. Poland stated that it would renounce citizenship rights of Polish Jews living abroad for at least five years after the end of October, effectively making them stateless. In the so-called \"Polenaktion\", more than 12,000 Polish Jews, among them the philosopher and theologian Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, and future literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki were expelled from Germany on 28 October 1938, on Hitler's orders. They were ordered to leave their homes in a single night and were allowed only one suitcase per person to carry their belongings. As the Jews were taken away, their remaining possessions were seized as loot both by Nazi authorities and by neighbors.\nThe deportees were taken from their homes to railway stations and were put on trains to the Polish border, where Polish border guards sent them back into Germany. This stalemate continued for days in the pouring rain, with the Jews marching without food or shelter between the borders. Four thousand were granted entry into Poland, but the remaining 8,000 were forced to stay at the border. They waited there in harsh conditions to be allowed to enter Poland. A British newspaper told its readers that hundreds \"are reported to be lying about, penniless and deserted, in little villages along the frontier near where they had been driven out by the Gestapo and left.\" Conditions in the refugee camps \"were so bad that some actually tried to escape back into Germany and were shot\", recalled a British woman who was sent to help those who had been expelled.\n\n\n=== Shooting of vom Rath ===\n\nAmong those expelled was the family of Sendel and Riva Grynszpan, Polish Jews who had emigrated to Germany in 1911 and settled in Hanover, Germany. At the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961, Sendel Grynszpan recounted the events of their deportation from Hanover on the night of 27 October 1938: \"Then they took us in police trucks, in prisoners' lorries, about 20 men in each truck, and they took us to the railway station. The streets were full of people shouting: 'Juden Raus! Auf Nach Pal\u00e4stina!'\" (\"Jews out, out to Palestine!\"). Their seventeen-year-old son Herschel was living in Paris with an uncle. Herschel received a postcard from his family from the Polish border, describing the family's expulsion: \"No one told us what was up, but we realized this was going to be the end ... We haven't a penny. Could you send us something?\" He received the postcard on 3 November 1938.\nOn the morning of Monday, 7 November 1938, he purchased a revolver and a box of bullets, then went to the German embassy and asked to see an embassy official. After he was taken to the office of Ernst vom Rath, Grynszpan fired five bullets at Vom Rath, two of which hit him in the abdomen. Vom Rath was a professional diplomat with the Foreign Office who expressed anti-Nazi sympathies, largely based on the Nazis' treatment of the Jews, and was under Gestapo investigation for being politically unreliable. Grynszpan made no attempt to escape the French police and freely confessed to the shooting. In his pocket, he carried a postcard to his parents with the message, \"May God forgive me ... I must protest so that the whole world hears my protest, and that I will do.\" It is widely assumed that the assassination was politically motivated, but historian Hans-J\u00fcrgen D\u00f6scher says the shooting may have been the result of a homosexual love affair gone wrong. Grynszpan and vom Rath had become intimate after they met in Le Boeuf sur le Toit, which was a popular meeting place for gay men at the time.The next day, the German government retaliated, barring Jewish children from German state elementary schools, indefinitely suspending Jewish cultural activities, and putting a halt to the publication of Jewish newspapers and magazines, including the three national German Jewish newspapers. A newspaper in Britain described the last move, which cut off the Jewish populace from their leaders, as \"intended to disrupt the Jewish community and rob it of the last frail ties which hold it together.\" Their rights as citizens had been stripped. One of the first legal measures issued was an order by Heinrich Himmler, commander of all German police, forbidding Jews to possess any weapons whatsoever and imposing a penalty of twenty years' confinement in a concentration camp upon every Jew found in possession of a weapon hereafter.\n\n\n== Pogrom ==\n\n\n=== Death of vom Rath ===\n\nErnst Vom Rath died of his wounds on 9 November 1938. Word of his death reached Hitler that evening while he was with several key members of the Nazi party at a dinner commemorating the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch. After intense discussions, Hitler left the assembly abruptly without giving his usual address. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels delivered the speech, in his place, and said that \"the F\u00fchrer has decided that... demonstrations should not be prepared or organized by the party, but insofar as they erupt spontaneously, they are not to be hampered.\" The chief party judge Walter Buch later stated that the message was clear; with these words, Goebbels had commanded the party leaders to organize a pogrom.Some leading party officials disagreed with Goebbels' actions, fearing the diplomatic crisis it would provoke. Heinrich Himmler wrote, \"I suppose that it is Goebbels's megalomania...and stupidity which is responsible for starting this operation now, in a particularly difficult diplomatic situation.\" The Israeli historian Saul Friedl\u00e4nder believes that Goebbels had personal reasons for wanting to bring about Kristallnacht. Goebbels had recently suffered humiliation for the ineffectiveness of his propaganda campaign during the Sudeten crisis, and was in some disgrace over an affair with a Czech actress, L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1. Goebbels needed a chance to improve his standing in the eyes of Hitler. At 1:20 am on 10 November 1938, Reinhard Heydrich sent an urgent secret telegram to the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police; SiPo) and the Sturmabteilung (SA), containing instructions regarding the riots. This included guidelines for the protection of foreigners and non-Jewish businesses and property. Police were instructed not to interfere with the riots unless the guidelines were violated. Police were also instructed to seize Jewish archives from synagogues and community offices, and to arrest and detain \"healthy male Jews, who are not too old\", for eventual transfer to (labor) concentration camps.\n\n\n=== Riots ===\n\nM\u00fcller, in a message to SA and SS commanders, stated the \"most extreme measures\" were to be taken against Jewish people. The SA and Hitler Youth shattered the windows of about 7,500 Jewish stores and businesses, hence the appellation Kristallnacht (Crystal Night), and looted their goods. Jewish homes were ransacked all throughout Germany. Although violence against Jews had not been explicitly condoned by the authorities, there were cases of Jews being beaten or assaulted. Following the violence, police departments recorded a large number of suicides and rapes.The rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland. Over 1400 synagogues and prayer rooms, many Jewish cemeteries, more than 7,000 Jewish shops, and 29 department stores were damaged, and in many cases destroyed. More than 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps; primarily Dachau, Buchenwald, and Sachsenhausen.The synagogues, some centuries old, were also victims of considerable violence and vandalism, with the tactics the Stormtroops practiced on these and other sacred sites described as \"approaching the ghoulish\" by the United States Consul in Leipzig. Tombstones were uprooted and graves violated. Fires were lit, and prayer books, scrolls, artwork and philosophy texts were thrown upon them, and precious buildings were either burned or smashed until unrecognizable. Eric Lucas recalls the destruction of the synagogue that a tiny Jewish community had constructed in a small village only twelve years earlier:\n\nIt did not take long before the first heavy grey stones came tumbling down, and the children of the village amused themselves as they flung stones into the many colored windows. When the first rays of a cold and pale November sun penetrated the heavy dark clouds, the little synagogue was but a heap of stone, broken glass and smashed-up woodwork.\nAfter this, the Jewish community was fined 1 billion Reichsmarks (equivalent to 4 billion 2009 \u20ac). In addition, it cost 40 million marks to repair the windows.\nThe Daily Telegraph correspondent, Hugh Greene, wrote of events in Berlin:\n\nMob law ruled in Berlin throughout the afternoon and evening and hordes of hooligans indulged in an orgy of destruction. I have seen several anti-Jewish outbreaks in Germany during the last five years, but never anything as nauseating as this. Racial hatred and hysteria seemed to have taken complete hold of otherwise decent people. I saw fashionably dressed women clapping their hands and screaming with glee, while respectable middle-class mothers held up their babies to see the \"fun\".\n\nMany Berliners were however deeply ashamed of the pogrom, and some took great personal risks to offer help. The son of a US consular official heard the janitor of his block cry: \"They must have emptied the insane asylums and penitentiaries to find people who'd do things like that!\"Tucson News TV channel briefly reported on a 2008 remembrance meeting at a local Jewish congregation. According to eyewitness Esther Harris: \"They ripped up the belongings, the books, knocked over furniture, shouted obscenities\". Historian Gerhard Weinberg is quoted as saying:\n\nHouses of worship burned down, vandalized, in every community in the country where people either participate or watch.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nFormer German Kaiser Wilhelm II commented \"For the first time, I am ashamed to be German.\"G\u00f6ring, who was in favor of expropriating the Jews rather than destroying Jewish property as had happened in the pogrom, complained directly to Sicherheitspolizei Chief Heydrich immediately after the events: \"I'd rather you had done in two-hundred Jews than destroy so many valuable assets!\" (\"Mir w\u00e4re lieber gewesen, ihr h\u00e4ttet 200 Juden erschlagen und h\u00e4ttet nicht solche Werte vernichtet!\"). G\u00f6ring met with other members of the Nazi leadership on 12 November to plan the next steps after the riot, setting the stage for formal government action. In the transcript of the meeting, G\u00f6ring said,\n\nI have received a letter written on the F\u00fchrer's orders requesting that the Jewish question be now, once and for all, coordinated and solved one way or another... I should not want to leave any doubt, gentlemen, as to the aim of today's meeting. We have not come together merely to talk again, but to make decisions, and I implore competent agencies to take all measures for the elimination of the Jew from the German economy, and to submit them to me.\nThe persecution and economic damage inflicted upon German Jews continued after the pogrom, even as their places of business were ransacked. They were forced to pay Judenverm\u00f6gensabgabe, a collective fine of one billion marks for the murder of vom Rath (equal to roughly $US 5.5 billion in today's currency), which was levied by the compulsory acquisition of 20% of all Jewish property by the state. Six million Reichsmarks of insurance payments for property damage due to the Jewish community were to be paid to the government instead as \"damages to the German Nation\".The number of emigrating Jews surged, as those who were able to left the country. In the ten months following Kristallnacht, more than 115,000 Jews emigrated from the Reich. The majority went to other European countries, the U.S. and Mandatory Palestine, and at least 14,000 made it to Shanghai, China. As part of government policy, the Nazis seized houses, shops, and other property the \u00e9migr\u00e9s left behind. Many of the destroyed remains of Jewish property plundered during Kristallnacht were dumped near Brandenburg. In October 2008, this dumpsite was discovered by Yaron Svoray, an investigative journalist. The site, the size of four Association football fields, contained an extensive array of personal and ceremonial items looted during the riots against Jewish property and places of worship on the night of 9 November 1938. It is believed the goods were brought by rail to the outskirts of the village and dumped on designated land. Among the items found were glass bottles engraved with the Star of David, mezuzot, painted window sills, and the armrests of chairs found in synagogues, in addition to an ornamental swastika.\n\n\n== Responses to Kristallnacht ==\n\n\n=== From the Germans ===\nThe reaction of non-Jewish Germans to Kristallnacht was varied. Many spectators gathered on the scenes, most of them in silence. The local fire departments confined themselves to prevent the flames from spreading to neighboring buildings. In Berlin, police Lieutenant Otto Bellgardt barred SA troopers from setting the New Synagogue on fire, earning his superior officer a verbal reprimand from the commissioner.\n\nThe British historian Martin Gilbert believes that \"many non-Jews resented the round-up\", his opinion being supported by German witness Dr. Arthur Flehinger who recalls seeing \"people crying while watching from behind their curtains\".\nRolf Dessauers recalls how a neighbor came forward and restored a portrait of Paul Ehrlich that had been \"slashed to ribbons\" by the Sturmabteilung. \"He wanted it to be known that not all Germans supported Kristallnacht.\"\nThe extent of the damage done on Kristallnacht was so great that many Germans are said to have expressed their disapproval of it, and to have described it as senseless.In an article released for publication on the evening of 11 November, Goebbels ascribed the events of Kristallnacht to the \"healthy instincts\" of the German people. He went on to explain: \"The German people are anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race.\" Less than 24 hours after Kristallnacht, Adolf Hitler made a one-hour long speech in front of a group of journalists where he completely ignored the recent events on everyone's mind. According to Eugene Davidson the reason for this was that Hitler wished to avoid being directly connected to an event that he was aware that many of those present condemned, regardless of Goebbels's unconvincing explanation that Kristallnacht was caused by popular wrath. Goebbels met the foreign press in the afternoon of 11 November and said that the burning of synagogues and damage to Jewish owned property had been \"spontaneous manifestations of indignation against the murder of Herr Vom Rath by the young Jew Grynsban [sic]\".In 1938, just after Kristallnacht, the psychologist Michael M\u00fcller-Claudius interviewed 41 randomly selected Nazi Party members on their attitudes towards racial persecution. Of the interviewed party-members 63% expressed extreme indignation against it, while only 5% expressed approval of racial persecution, the rest being noncommittal. A study conducted in 1933 had then shown that 33% of Nazi Party members held no racial prejudice while 13% supported persecution. Sarah Ann Gordon sees two possible reasons for this difference. First, by 1938 large numbers of Germans had joined the Nazi Party for pragmatic reasons rather than ideology thus diluting the percentage of rabid antisemites; second, the Kristallnacht could have caused party members to reject antisemitism that had been acceptable to them in abstract terms but which they could not support when they saw it concretely enacted. During the events of Kristallnacht, several Gauleiter and deputy Gauleiters had refused orders to enact the Kristallnacht, and many leaders of the SA and of the Hitler Youth also openly refused party orders, while expressing disgust. Some Nazis helped Jews during the Kristallnacht.As it was aware that the German public did not support the Kristallnacht, the propaganda ministry directed the German press to portray opponents of racial persecution as disloyal. The press was also under orders to downplay the Kristallnacht, describing general events at the local level only, with prohibition against depictions of individual events. In 1939 this was extended to a prohibition on reporting any anti-Jewish measures.The U.S. ambassador to Germany reported:\n\nIn view of this being a totalitarian state a surprising characteristic of the situation here is the intensity and scope among German citizens of condemnation of the recent happenings against Jews.\nTo the consternation of the Nazis, the Kristallnacht affected public opinion counter to their desires, the peak of opposition against the Nazi racial policies was reached just then, when according to almost all accounts the vast majority of Germans rejected the violence perpetrated against the Jews. Verbal complaints grew rapidly in numbers, and for example, the Duesseldorf branch of the Gestapo reported a sharp decline in anti-Semitic attitudes among the population.There are many indications of Protestant and Catholic disapproval of racial persecution; for example, anti-Nazi Protestants adopted the Barmen Declaration in 1934, and the Catholic church had already distributed Pastoral letters critical of Nazi racial ideology, and the Nazi regime expected to encounter organised resistance from it following Kristallnacht. The Catholic leadership however, just as the various Protestant churches, refrained from responding with organised action. While individual Catholics and Protestants took action, the churches as a whole chose silence publicly. Nevertheless, individuals continued to show courage, for example, a Parson paid the medical bills of a Jewish cancer patient and was sentenced to a large fine and several months in prison in 1941, Reformed Church pastor Paul Schneider placed a Nazi sympathizer under church discipline and he was subsequently sent to Buchenwald where he was murdered. A Catholic nun was sentenced to death in 1945 for helping Jews. A Protestant parson spoke out in 1943 and was sent to Dachau concentration camp where he died after a few days.Martin Sasse, Nazi Party member and bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia, leading member of the Nazi German Christians, one of the schismatic factions of German Protestantism, published a compendium of Martin Luther's writings shortly after the Kristallnacht; Sasse \"applauded the burning of the synagogues\" and the coincidence of the day, writing in the introduction, \"On 10 November 1938, on Luther's birthday, the synagogues are burning in Germany.\" The German people, he urged, ought to heed these words \"of the greatest anti-Semite of his time, the warner of his people against the Jews.\" Diarmaid MacCulloch argued that Luther's 1543 pamphlet, On the Jews and Their Lies was a \"blueprint\" for the Kristallnacht.\n\n\n=== From the global community ===\n\nKristallnacht sparked international outrage. According to Volker Ullrich, \"...a line had been crossed: Germany had left the community of civilised nations.\" It discredited pro-Nazi movements in Europe and North America, leading to an eventual decline in their support. Many newspapers condemned Kristallnacht, with some of them comparing it to the murderous pogroms incited by Imperial Russia during the 1880s. The United States recalled its ambassador (but it did not break off diplomatic relations) while other governments severed diplomatic relations with Germany in protest. The British government approved the Kindertransport program for refugee children. As such, Kristallnacht also marked a turning point in relations between Nazi Germany and the rest of the world. The brutality of the pogrom, and the Nazi government's deliberate policy of encouraging the violence once it had begun, laid bare the repressive nature and widespread anti-Semitism entrenched in Germany. World opinion thus turned sharply against the Nazi regime, with some politicians calling for war. The private protest against the Germans following Kristallnacht was held on 6 December 1938. William Cooper, an Aboriginal Australian, led a delegation of the Australian Aboriginal League on a march through Melbourne to the German Consulate to deliver a petition which condemned the \"cruel persecution of the Jewish people by the Nazi government of Germany\". German officials refused to accept the tendered document.After the Kristallnacht, Salvador Allende, Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez Videla, Marmaduke Grove, Florencio Dur\u00e1n and other members of the Congress of Chile sent a telegram to Adolf Hitler denouncing the persecution of Jews.\nA more personal response, in 1939, was the oratorio A Child of Our Time by the English composer Michael Tippett.\n\n\n== Kristallnacht as a turning point ==\nKristallnacht changed the nature of the Nazi persecution of Jews from economic, political, and social to physical with beatings, incarceration, and murder; the event is often referred to as the beginning of the Holocaust. In this view, it is described not only as a pogrom but also a critical stage within a process where each step becomes the seed of the next. An account cited that Hitler's green light for Kristallnacht was made with the belief that it would help him realize his ambition of getting rid of the Jews in Germany. Prior to this large-scale and organized violence against the Jews, the Nazi's primary objective was to eject them from Germany, leaving their wealth behind. In the words of historian Max Rein in 1988, \"Kristallnacht came...and everything was changed.\"While November 1938 predated the overt articulation of \"the Final Solution\", it foreshadowed the genocide to come. Around the time of Kristallnacht, the SS newspaper Das Schwarze Korps called for a \"destruction by swords and flames.\" At a conference on the day after the pogrom, Hermann G\u00f6ring said: \"The Jewish problem will reach its solution if, in anytime soon, we will be drawn into war beyond our border\u2014then it is obvious that we will have to manage a final account with the Jews.\"Kristallnacht was also instrumental in changing global opinion. In the United States, for instance, it was this specific incident that came to symbolize Nazism and was the reason the Nazis became associated with evil.\n\n\n== Modern references ==\n\nMany decades later, association with the Kristallnacht anniversary was cited as the main reason against choosing 9 November (Schicksalstag), the day the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, as the new German national holiday; a different day was chosen (3 October 1990, German reunification).The avant-garde guitarist Gary Lucas's 1988 composition \"Verkl\u00e4rte Kristallnacht\", which juxtaposes what would become the Israeli national anthem ten years after Kristallnacht, \"Hatikvah\", with phrases from the German national anthem \"Deutschland \u00dcber Alles\" amid wild electronic shrieks and noise, is intended to be a sonic representation of the horrors of Kristallnacht. It was premiered at the 1988 Berlin Jazz Festival and received rave reviews. (The title is a reference to Arnold Schoenberg's 1899 work \"Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht\" that presaged his pioneering work on atonal music; Schoenberg was an Austrian Jew who would move to the United States to escape the Nazis).In 1989, Al Gore, then a senator from Tennessee and later Vice President of the United States, wrote of an \"ecological Kristallnacht\" in the New York Times. He opined that events then taking place, such as deforestation and ozone depletion, prefigured a greater environmental catastrophe in the way Kristallnacht prefigured the Holocaust.Kristallnacht was the inspiration for the 1993 album Kristallnacht by the composer John Zorn. The German power metal band Masterplan's debut album, Masterplan (2003), features an anti-Nazi song entitled \"Crystal Night\" as the fourth track. The German band BAP published a song titled \"Kristallnaach\" in their Cologne dialect, dealing with the emotions engendered by the Kristallnacht.Kristallnacht was the inspiration for the 1988 composition Mayn Yngele by the composer Frederic Rzewski, of which he says: \"I began writing this piece in November 1988, on the 50th anniversary of the Kristallnacht ... My piece is a reflection on that vanished part of Jewish tradition which so strongly colors, by its absence, the culture of our time\".In 2014, the Wall Street Journal published a letter from billionaire Thomas Perkins that compared the \"progressive war on the American one percent\" of wealthiest Americans and the Occupy movement's \"demonization of the rich\" to the Kristallnacht and anti-semitism in Nazi Germany. The letter was widely criticized and condemned in The Atlantic, The Independent, among bloggers, Twitter users, and \"his own colleagues in Silicon Valley\". Perkins subsequently apologized for making the comparisons with Nazi Germany, but otherwise stood by his letter, saying, \"In the Nazi era it was racial demonization, now it's class demonization.\"Kristallnacht was invoked as a reference point on 16 July 2018 by a former Watergate Prosecutor, Jill Wine-Banks, during an MSNBC segment. Her argument was that President Trump's joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin was a performance that would live in infamy much like the attack on Pearl Harbor and Kristallnacht.Kristallnacht has been referenced both explicitly and implicitly in countless cases of vandalism of Jewish property including the toppling of gravestones in a Jewish cemetery in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and the two 2017 vandalisms of the New England Holocaust Memorial, as the memorial's founder Steve Ross discusses in his book, From Broken Glass: My Story of Finding Hope in Hitler's Death Camps to Inspire a New Generation. The Sri Lankan Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera also used the term to describe the violence in 2019 against Muslims by Sinhalese nationalists.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAktionsjuden\nNathan Israel Department Store\nSpandau Synagogue\nNovember 9 in German history\n\n\n== References ==\nInformational notes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nGordon, Sarah Ann (1984).

        "wiki": "Antwerp ( (listen); Dutch: Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen); French: Anvers [\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281s] (listen)) is a city in Belgium and the capital of Antwerp province in the Flemish Region. With a population of 520,504, it is the most populous city proper in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people, it is the second largest metropolitan region after Brussels.Antwerp is on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe and within the top 20 globally. The city is also known for its diamond industry and trade.\nBoth economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt. Antwerp was also the place of the world's oldest stock exchange building, originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872.The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren (Dutch pronunciation: [s\u026a\u0272\u02c8jo\u02d0r\u0259(n)]), after the Spanish honorific se\u00f1or or French seigneur, \"lord\", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century. The city hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is New Latin.A Germanic (Frankish or Frisian) origin could contain prefix anda (\u201cagainst\u201d) and a noun derived from the verb werpen (\u201cto throw\u201d) and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit; a mound (like a terp) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf. If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean \"those who live on both banks\".There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river. He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt.\n\n\n=== Pre-1500 ===\nHistorical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952\u20131961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. The earliest mention of Antwerp dates from the 4th century.\nIn the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks.The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II, a border province facing the County of Flanders.\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon,  was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nAfter the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant, grew in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly enslaved Africans as the century progressed. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544\u20131574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became \"the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height.\" Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the \"Age of Exploration\". During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps.  Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas\".\n\nWithout a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venetian Republic, Republic of Ragusa, Spain and Portugal.  Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \"To the merchants of all nations.\" Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers.  In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth.  Numerous financial bankruptcies  began around 1557. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nThe religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries. The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury: 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over \u00a32 million sterling of damage was done.\n\n\n=== Dutch revolt ===\nSubsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa, and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock) and an access- lock and mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.\n\nIn 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chass\u00e9. For a time Chass\u00e9 subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass\u00e9 made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi)  from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAntwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During World War I, the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Li\u00e8ge. The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.\nAntwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. \nDuring World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote, V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic) Orthodox Judaism.\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into nine entities (districts):\n\nAntwerp\nBerchem\nBerendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo\nBorgerhout\nDeurne\nEkeren\nHoboken\nMerksem\nWilrijkIn 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp, the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.\n\n\n== Buildings and landmarks ==\n\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was noted for the wealth of its citizens (\"Antwerpia nummis\"). The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the Hanseatic League on the northern quays, in 1891. During World War II, the city also suffered considerable damage from V-bombs, and in recent years, other noteworthy buildings have been demolished for new developments.\n\nAntwerp Zoo opened in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the world.\nAntwerp City Hall dates from 1565, and is built primarily in Renaissance style.\nAntwerp Central Station is a railway station designed by Louis Delacenserie which was completed in 1905.\nCathedral of Our Lady. This church was begun in the 14th century and finished in 1518. The church has four works by Rubens, viz. \"The Descent from the Cross\", \"The Elevation of the Cross\", \"The Resurrection of Christ\" and \"The Assumption\"\nSt. James' Church, is more ornate than the cathedral. It contains the remains of numerous famous nobles, among them a major part of the family of Rubens.\nThe Church of St. Paul has a baroque interior. It is a few hundred yards north of the Grote Markt\nSt. Andrew's Church\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church\nMuseum Vleeshuis (Butchers' Hall) is a fine Gothic brick-built building, situated a short distance to the North-West of the Grote Markt.\nPlantin-Moretus Museum preserves the house of the printer Christoffel Plantijn and his successor Jan Moretus\nThe Saint-Boniface Church is an Anglican church and headseat of the archdeanery North-West Europe.\nBoerentoren (Farmers' Tower) or KBC Tower, a 26-storey building built in 1932, is the oldest skyscraper in Europe. It is the tallest building in Antwerp and the second tallest structure after the Cathedral of our Lady. The building was designed by Emiel van Averbeke, R. Van Hoenacker and Jos Smolderen.\nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts\nMuseum Mayer van den Bergh, with works from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nRubenshuis is the former home and studio of Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) in Antwerp. It is now a museum.\nRockox House is the former 17th-century Residence of Nicolaas II Rockox, lord Mayor of Antwerp.\nBourse of Antwerp. Originally built 1531; extensively restored 1872; now Antwerp Trade Fair.\nPalace of Justice, designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006. This building is the antithesis of the heavy, dark court building, designed by Joseph Poelaert, which dominates the skyline of Brussels. The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built on the site of the old Zuid (\"South\") station, at the end of a magnificent 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12). The building's highest 'sail' is 51 m (167 ft) high, has a floor area of 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft), and cost \u20ac130 million.\nZurenborg, a late-19th-century Belle \u00c9poque neighbourhood, on the border of Antwerp and Berchem, with many Art Nouveau architectural elements. The area counts as one of the most original Belle \u00c9poque urban expansion areas in Europe.\nMuseum aan de Stroom\nDen Botaniek or Antwerp's Botanical Garden, created in 1825. Located in the city centre, at the Leopoldstraat, it covers an area of almost 1 hectare.\nHarmonium Art museuM, a museum on pump organs in Klein-Willebroek\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (M HKA)\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\n\nAlthough Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former enceinte, only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. A replica of a castle named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais in the 19th century.\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:\n\n10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch\n12th and 13th century: canals (so called \"vlieten\" and \"ruien\") were made\n16th century: Spanish fortifications\n19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications\n20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\nThis is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.\n\n\n=== Minorities ===\nIn 2010, 36% to 39% of the inhabitants of Antwerp had a migrant background. A study projects that in 2020, 55% of the population will be of migrant background.\n\n\n==== Jewish community ====\n\nAfter The Holocaust and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic, live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff  (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk, based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Ger, Skver, Klausenburg, Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\n==== Jain community ====\n\nThe Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business. Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds. A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk).  Mr Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a full-fledged member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nThere are significant Armenian communities that reside in Antwerp, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with a smaller numbers are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church.\nOne of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel and involved in is the diamond trade business, that based primarily in the diamond district. Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nAccording to the American Association of Port Authorities, the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014\u20132020.  The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.\n\n\n=== Diamonds ===\nAntwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion. The city has four diamond bourses: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers. Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian and Maronite Christian from Lebanon and Armenian, traders become increasingly important.Antwerp World Diamond Centre, (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry. However, in recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nA six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to Brussels, Hasselt and Li\u00e8ge, Ghent, Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"Oosterweelconnection\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to Amsterdam and Paris, and national trains to Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Brussels, Charleroi, Hasselt, Li\u00e8ge, Leuven and Turnhout.\nAntwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald's haunting novel Austerlitz. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"premetro\" and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nA small airport, Antwerp International Airport, is located in the district of Deurne, with passenger service to various European destinations. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre.\nThe now defunct VLM Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport. This office is also CityJet's Antwerp office. When VG Airlines (Delsey Airlines) existed, its head office was located in the district of Merksem.Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport, is about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.\nThere is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs twice every hour on working days.\nThe runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.\nIn September 2019 Air Antwerp began operations with their first route to London City Airport with old VLM Airlines Fokker 50's.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections.\nThe current majority consists of N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld, led by mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA).\n\n\n=== Former mayors ===\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century important mayors include Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Nicolaas II Rockox.\nIn the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti\u00e8ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (New Flemish Alliance).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntwerp has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) similar to that of Southern England, while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) average highs for both July and August. Winters are more dominated by the maritime currents instead, with temps being heavily moderated.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAntwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its school of painting, which included Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the Teniers and many others.\n\nInformally, most Antverpians (in Dutch Antwerpenaren, people from Antwerp) speak Antverpian daily (in Dutch Antwerps), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other Brabantic dialects for its characteristic pronunciation of vowels: an 'aw' sound approximately like that in 'bore' is used for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the 'a' in 'hat'. The Echt Antwaarps Teater (\"Authentic Antverpian Theatre\") brings the dialect on stage.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nAntwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in the world. It has served as the learning centre for many Belgian fashion designers. Since the 1980s, several graduates of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts have become internationally successful fashion designers in Antwerp. The city has had a huge influence on other Belgian fashion designers such as Raf Simons, Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Theyskens and Kris Van Assche.\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nAntwerp is famous for its local products. In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally \"Antwerp Hands\". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.\n\n\n=== Missions to seafarers ===\nA number of Christian missions to seafarers are based in Antwerp, notably on the Itali\u00eblei. These include the Mission to Seafarers, British & International Sailors' Society, the Finnish Seamen's Mission, the Norwegian Sj\u00f8mannskirken and the Apostleship of the Sea. They provide cafeterias, cultural and social activities as well as religious services.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAntwerp is the home of the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC), founded in 1938 and located on the square Grote Markt since 1994.The band dEUS was formed in 1991 in Antwerp. dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material. Their musical influences range from folk and punk to jazz and progressive rock.\n\n\n=== Music festivals ===\nCultuurmarkt van Vlaanderen is a musical festival and a touristic attraction that takes place annually on the final Sunday of August in the city center of Antwerp. Where international and local musicians and actors, present their stage and street performances.Linkerwoofer is a pop-rock music festival located at the left bank of the Scheldt. This music festival starts in August and mostly local Belgian musicians play and perform in this event.Other popular festivals Fire Is Gold, and focuses more on urban music, and Summerfestival.\n\n\n=== World Choir Games ===\nThe city of Antwerp will co-host the 2020 World Choir Games together with the city of Ghent. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAntwerp held the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were the first games after the First World War and also the only ones to be held in Belgium. The road cycling events took place in the streets of the city.Royal Antwerp F.C., currently playing in the Belgian First Division, were founded in 1880 and is known as 'The Great Old' for being the first club registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1895. Since 1998, the club has taken Manchester United players on loan in an official partnership. Another club in the city was Beerschot VAC, founded in 1899 by former Royal Antwerp players. They played at the Olympisch Stadion, the main venue of the 1920 Olympics. Nowadays KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk plays at the Olympisch Stadion in the Belgian Second Division.\nThe Antwerp Giants play in Basketball League Belgium and Topvolley Antwerpen play in the Belgium men's volleyball League.\nFor the year 2013, Antwerp was awarded the title of European Capital of Sport.\nAntwerp hosted the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nAntwerp hosted the start of stage 3 of the 2015 Tour de France on 6 July 2015.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\nAntwerp has a university and several colleges. The University of Antwerp  (Universiteit Antwerpen) was established in 2003, following the merger of the RUCA, UFSIA and UIA institutes. Their roots go back to 1852. The University has approximately 23,000 registered students, making it the third-largest university in Flanders, as well as 1,800 foreign students. It has 7 faculties, spread over four campus locations in the city centre and in the south of the city.\nThe city has several colleges, including Antwerp Management School (AMS), Charlemagne University College (Karel de Grote Hogeschool), Plantin University College (Plantijn Hogeschool), and Artesis University College (Artesis Hogeschool). Artesis University College has about 8,600 students and 1,600 staff, and Charlemagne University College has about 10,000 students and 1,300 staff. Plantin University College has approximately 3,700 students.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nThe following places are twinned with or sister cities to Antwerp:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Born in Antwerp ===\n\n\n=== Lived in Antwerp ===\n\n\n== Select neighbourhoods ==\nDen Dam \u2013 an area in northern Antwerp\nThe diamond district \u2013 an area consisting of several square blocks, it is Antwerp's centre for the cutting, polishing, and trading of diamonds\nLinkeroever \u2013 Antwerp on the left bank of the Scheldt with a lot of apartment buildings\nMeir \u2013 Antwerp's largest shopping street\nVan Wesenbekestraat \u2013 the city's Chinatown\nHet Zuid \u2013 the south of Antwerp, notable for its museums and Expo grounds\nZurenborg \u2013 an area between Central and Berchem station with a concentration of Art Nouveau townhouses\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntwerp Book Fair\nAntwerp lace\nAntwerp Water Works (AWW)\nJewish Community of Antwerp\nLetterenhuis\nList of mayors of Antwerp\nPshevorsk \u2013 Hassidic Jewish movement based in Antwerp\nRoyal Antwerp F.C., local football club\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nBlanchard, Ian.

          "Not bad. Nothing wowed me tbh, besides the photographed piece of course. Truly breathtaking, really got me thinking.",
          "Interesting works, loved the eggs.",
          "a museum of modern art... the collection are really... modern. Not my taste at all but I ll guess we need art for everybody in this world so may be some are happy with it. Though, if you are not a super modern art lover then I will advise to go to the Museum of Photo next to the place.",
          "Could be done more for a museum of contemporary art in such an important city like Antwerpen",
          "Very good Musium to visit",
          "Not so many art pieces, a little dissapointing.",
          "I liked the ambiance but the exhibition was really dull.",
          "Loved the museum! Beautiful exhibitions. Lists of room and nice ambient. Staff are very nice and helpful. Liked the interactive exhibitions",
          "Really nice with cool exhibition! A must for contemporary art lovers",
          "Very subjective opinion, but didn't meet the expectations for the famous Antwerp museum. The static exposition is quite humble. The other expos are temporary and only few of them.",
          "Always nice to go there",
          "People may feel creepy, but exhibisions are fantastic! I even felt sense of touching things from only sounds and images.",
          "Amazing crafts manship - a beauty on his own in simplicity.",
          "Very empty rooms. Waste of time. Waste of money.",
          "Casual museum goers may find the art here a little obscure, but there is definitely much to enjoy. The layout is a little difficult to figure out, and there is no overall map to help. If you\u2019re here during the exhibit Sanguine/Bloedrood, \u2026",
          "Always worth to visit! There is also a cosy place outside, where you can take a rest   with a drink and a cake.",
          "very nice stuff there",
          "Some of the stuff I didn't really connect with. That's art for ya! But they have some very interesting, thought provoking stuff. The outdoor installation (Five Car Stud, by Edward Kienholz) is mind boggling in every way.",
          "We only entered the free admission part of the museum because we arrived too late. This section was not interesting at all, and it was also very small. There's a nice rooftop where you can also go up free of charge. No view to anywhere, but \u2026",
          "Must see and only 1\u20ac ticket for under 26 year olds",
          "Not the best thing to do in Antwerp. The art aims to be provocative but it ends up being just edgy and not so good at all.",
          "The temporary exhibition with plush toys is rather remarkable",
          "From 2 to 8 floor there are many excellent exhibition that anyone can enjoy. Price of ticket not so high - 8\u20ac(november 2018). Also there is a panorama view at the 9th floor with a beautiful view on Antwerp",
          "Very limited collection on display",
          "Didn't have much in it",
          "Good price, creative artwork, lovely cafe",
          "Nice museuk but they were changing collections so we could only see the permanent collection. Nice collection though! Price is great for everything they have on display.",
          "Depending on the exposition, good place to see temporary art",
          "Cool building for expositions. Nice museum if you like modern art.",
          "Great museum with ever changing exhibitions.",
          "The place to be in Antwerp if you like contemporary art! The main collection is also worth a visit.",
          "A museum that opens till 9 pm!!  Must Antwerp museums close at 5/6 pm.",
          "Very little collection. Store is too small and it is far if you have limited time for visit dont go here. (Roof was nice)",
          "For people who\u2019s love modern art!",
          "Limited exhibition.  Nothing great",
          "Quiet and modern place. They have free wifi zone, free library with outstanding books and a rooftop restaurant. Museum has a great potential. I wish they had more masterpieces in the main exposition.",
          "Some interesting works out there, but wouldn\u2019t say those were fantastic.. still, I loved the cosy library in the lobby",
          "Definitely worth a stop when visiting Antwerp, especially if you're in the area  (its a short walk from the Grote Markt). The permanent collection (the free part) of the museum was kind of disappointing, mostly because although the art was \u2026",
          "Still \"growing\" art institution hopefully one day to be an influential one in art scene.",
          "Go see the Sanguine exposition. Perfectly sized, varied, surprising and great to spend an hour getting inspired.",
          "Beautiful temporary exhibition. The museum collections are ... Modern, controversial and not always worth...",
          "I'm just not smart enough to get it. I wouldn't go again.",
          "I didn't understand a thing",
          "Incredible collection of modern and contemporary art. Tickets are cheap and the content of the museum is usually well worth it. One of the better contemporary collections in Flanders.",
          "really good museum, although the art is very contemporary and strange at times! Strange in a good way though :)",
          "There is a lot of potential here, given the size of the museum. Unfortunately when I went they were in the transition of updating the galleries. As a result, only the first floor gallery space was available, although this was free as a result. There is a nice cafe on the 5th or 6th floor for those looking for a snack or meal. .",
          "Pretty place",
          "Useless contemporary art.",
          "I visited the Sanguine/Bloedrood exhibition. I saw inspiring art next to objects i could not eally connect to. Wonderfull mix of things that made u reflect more than if would be a more homogene selextion i find. The Caravaggio painting and the Harnessed Swimmer were defnately the works that spoke most to me.",
          "I workwd there almost two months to prepare exhibition. I miss this place",
          "Fascinating exhibits",
          "Very interesting installations a few years ago.",
          "Too much space taken by too little and too abstract expositions, and a very small permanent collection.",
          "Excellent space with excellent content. Thursday nights you can experience the museum for 1Euro - this past Thursday one of the artists was there to speak about his installation. Proud to have it in the city.",
          "Great place to visit, strong exhibitions, just be weary of the lady at the front desk......ow and lots of artsy people ..... .",
          "Wonderful exhibition of Anne-Mie van Kerckhoven in MUHKA! Go see it!",
          "Not worth the visit today. I've never been before. They have lots of building work going on so there is limited items to see. There is a reduced ticket price, however if we had been fully aware of the limited exhibition we would have not \u2026",
          "Spacious setting.  There's usually a temporary exhibition going on, so it's a good idea tot check their website. Given the space (andere the kid's corner) also an option with the little ones.",
          "Had almost too much fun at the slightly tacky yet wonderfuly curated \"energy flash\" exhibition. Friendly staff and love for details made the visit a great experience.",
          "Hm, contemporary art in a very exciting building but.. something is missing. Inspiration?",
          "Amazing experience!",
          "the rave exhibit was phenomenal: very well curated and thought out...everything from video and music installations to mixed tapes to outfits to (not real) drugs...I would definitely return to here to see their next exhibit ",
          "It's a cool building, and most of the time the temporary exhibitions are interesting. \nThe rooftop bar is a nice place to relax a bit. ",
          "very nice",
          "I went there during a museum night. The theme at that time was not something that I was interested.",
          "Very disappointing museum, only seen 2 pieces of art that I liked. Not really worth your time or money.",
          "Interesting museum, lots of reading material about the exhibitions",
          "Nice building in a quieter portion of Antwep",
          "There are many creatively different exhibitions. Useful place for world view development.",
          "Interesting modern building with an outspoken architecture from the inside and out. Don't forget to check out their rooftop terras for one of the best views of Antwerp Zuid. ",
          "Amazing terrace",
          "nicely curated museum at a an attractive admission price.",
          "Mindblowing",
          "Not bad but the works are a pain to look up in the booklet, a simple number system would have solved this.",
          "Nothing much to see today, photography exhibition was all but not worth the reduced entry fee of \u20ac5; quite disappointing and lots of empty space that some new local artists could be using.",

        "wiki": "St. Andrew\u2019s Church (Dutch: Sint-Andrieskerk) is a Catholic church in Antwerp built in the 16th century.  Its exterior is mainly characterised by a late-Gothic style while its interior is predominantly executed in Baroque style. It is the parish church of the Parish of St. Andrew\u2019s. During the nineteenth century the St. Andrew's Parish was known as the parish of misery as it was by then mainly populated by poor people.\n\n\n== History ==\nConstruction of the church commenced in the 16th century by Augustine friars who had built a convent with a chapel at the same location in 1513. Johannes van Mechelen of Osbach initiated 1508 the foundation of the monastery. The Augustinians decided to build a church there in 1514 but when they were accused of Lutheran sympathies the grounds were taken from them.  In 1527 the site was parceled to finance the building of the church. The former convent chapel was expanded and then consecrated as a parish church in 1529.  The church was later expanded with a tower in the west and a transept.\n\nIn 1549, city politician and ecclesiastic Nicolaas Beukelaer endowed the church with a prebendary to assist with the administration of the church.\n\nDuring the Beeldenstorm of 1566 the church interior was destroyed.  The church was divided up between Catholics and Calvinists in 1568.  In 1579 the division was made permanent through the construction of a dividing wall.  In 1581 the Calvinists denied the Catholics access to the church and demolished the part of the church that was assigned to the Catholics.  After the Fall of Antwerp in 1585 and the defeat of the Calvinists, the church was returned to the Catholics.  The church was decorated with new altar pieces by leading Antwerp artists such as Otto van Veen, Maerten de Vos and one of the many members of the Francken family who lived nearby.In the middle of the 17th century a large construction campaign was started.  First an arch was built over the nave and the transept destroyed by the Calvinists was rebuilt and expanded.  In subsequent years, the church was further expanded with a choir with two bays and later with two chapels.  In 1755 the tower of the church collapsed and a new Baroque tower designed by Engelbert Baets was constructed inside the western bay of the nave.During the French revolutionary occupation starting in 1794, the church was saved by the decision of the priest Jan-Michiel Timmermans to swear allegiance to the French regime.  The church lost some of its silver, the triptych by Marten de Vos and the statue of St. Peter by Artus Quellinus I to confiscation by the French.  After the Concordat of 1801 between Napoleon and the Pope, the church became again the parish church of the Parish of St. Andrew\u2019s in 1802 and the confiscated St. Peter statue was returned.  It would take longer to recover the Marten de Vos triptych which finally ended up in the Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp.In the early 19th century, more Baroque furniture and paintings, mainly retrieved from churches and monasteries destroyed or closed during the French occupation, were added to the church.  The church suffered major damage during the Dutch bombardment of Antwerp in 1830 and burnt down partially.  From 1863 the church was fitted out with new stained glass windows in Gothic Revival style.  The stained glass windows on the north side were destroyed on 2 January 1945 through the explosion of a German V-1 flying bomb.  These were later replaced by windows designed by Jan Huet.\n\n\n== Church art ==\n\nThe church contains many valuable artefacts and art works.  It holds a monument erected in memory of Mary, Queen of Scots, by Robert and Jan De Nole (1620) with a portrait painted on copper by Frans Pourbus the Younger (1569-1622).\nThere are many paintings by Antwerp's leading painters such as Ambrosius Francken (1544-1618), Otto van Veen (1560-1629), Hendrick van Balen (1575-1632), Maarten Pepyn (1575-1643), Frans Francken the Younger (1581-1642), the workshop of Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), Erasmus Quellinus the Younger (1607-78), Theodoor Boeyermans and Karel Verlat (1845\u201357).\nMany of the church's furnishings are distinctly in the Baroque style, as earlier pieces had been destroyed during the 16th century Beeldenstorm.  The church furniture is made by some of the leading sculptors of their time.  The High Altar was originally from the former St. Bernard Abbey and the choir stalls from the convent of the Augustinian friars and are both the work of Pieter Verbrugghen I (1615\u201368).  The sacrament altar and confessional in the Our Lady's Chapel are by Lodewijk Willemsens (1630-1703). The Holy Cross Altar is by Cornelis van Mildert (1664). The St. Anna Shrine is by Jan van den Cruyce (1674).  The Our Lady Altar was made by Peeter Vervoort and father and son Willem Kerrickx (1729). The organ case is the work of Engelbert Baets (1779) and the pulpit is by Jan Baptist Van Hool and Jan Frans van Geel (1821).Many of the church's features were restored in the 1970s.  In 2001, the church's statue of the Virgin Mary dated 1585 (referred to as Our Lady of Succour and Victory) was dressed in modern clothes designed by local fashion designer Ann Demeulemeester to commemorate Antwerp's \"Fashion Year\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMonumental Churches of Antwerp - St. Andrews\nVisit Antwerp - St. Andrew's Church",

        "wiki": "Antwerp ( (listen); Dutch: Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen); French: Anvers [\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281s] (listen)) is a city in Belgium and the capital of Antwerp province in the Flemish Region. With a population of 520,504, it is the most populous city proper in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people, it is the second largest metropolitan region after Brussels.Antwerp is on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe and within the top 20 globally. The city is also known for its diamond industry and trade.\nBoth economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt. Antwerp was also the place of the world's oldest stock exchange building, originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872.The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren (Dutch pronunciation: [s\u026a\u0272\u02c8jo\u02d0r\u0259(n)]), after the Spanish honorific se\u00f1or or French seigneur, \"lord\", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century. The city hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is New Latin.A Germanic (Frankish or Frisian) origin could contain prefix anda (\u201cagainst\u201d) and a noun derived from the verb werpen (\u201cto throw\u201d) and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit; a mound (like a terp) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf. If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean \"those who live on both banks\".There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river. He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt.\n\n\n=== Pre-1500 ===\nHistorical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952\u20131961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. The earliest mention of Antwerp dates from the 4th century.\nIn the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks.The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II, a border province facing the County of Flanders.\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon,  was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nAfter the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant, grew in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly enslaved Africans as the century progressed. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544\u20131574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became \"the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height.\" Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the \"Age of Exploration\". During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps.  Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas\".\n\nWithout a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venetian Republic, Republic of Ragusa, Spain and Portugal.  Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \"To the merchants of all nations.\" Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers.  In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth.  Numerous financial bankruptcies  began around 1557. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nThe religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries. The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury: 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over \u00a32 million sterling of damage was done.\n\n\n=== Dutch revolt ===\nSubsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa, and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock) and an access- lock and mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.\n\nIn 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chass\u00e9. For a time Chass\u00e9 subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass\u00e9 made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi)  from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAntwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During World War I, the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Li\u00e8ge. The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.\nAntwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. \nDuring World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote, V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic) Orthodox Judaism.\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into nine entities (districts):\n\nAntwerp\nBerchem\nBerendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo\nBorgerhout\nDeurne\nEkeren\nHoboken\nMerksem\nWilrijkIn 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp, the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.\n\n\n== Buildings and landmarks ==\n\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was noted for the wealth of its citizens (\"Antwerpia nummis\"). The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the Hanseatic League on the northern quays, in 1891. During World War II, the city also suffered considerable damage from V-bombs, and in recent years, other noteworthy buildings have been demolished for new developments.\n\nAntwerp Zoo opened in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the world.\nAntwerp City Hall dates from 1565, and is built primarily in Renaissance style.\nAntwerp Central Station is a railway station designed by Louis Delacenserie which was completed in 1905.\nCathedral of Our Lady. This church was begun in the 14th century and finished in 1518. The church has four works by Rubens, viz. \"The Descent from the Cross\", \"The Elevation of the Cross\", \"The Resurrection of Christ\" and \"The Assumption\"\nSt. James' Church, is more ornate than the cathedral. It contains the remains of numerous famous nobles, among them a major part of the family of Rubens.\nThe Church of St. Paul has a baroque interior. It is a few hundred yards north of the Grote Markt\nSt. Andrew's Church\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church\nMuseum Vleeshuis (Butchers' Hall) is a fine Gothic brick-built building, situated a short distance to the North-West of the Grote Markt.\nPlantin-Moretus Museum preserves the house of the printer Christoffel Plantijn and his successor Jan Moretus\nThe Saint-Boniface Church is an Anglican church and headseat of the archdeanery North-West Europe.\nBoerentoren (Farmers' Tower) or KBC Tower, a 26-storey building built in 1932, is the oldest skyscraper in Europe. It is the tallest building in Antwerp and the second tallest structure after the Cathedral of our Lady. The building was designed by Emiel van Averbeke, R. Van Hoenacker and Jos Smolderen.\nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts\nMuseum Mayer van den Bergh, with works from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nRubenshuis is the former home and studio of Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) in Antwerp. It is now a museum.\nRockox House is the former 17th-century Residence of Nicolaas II Rockox, lord Mayor of Antwerp.\nBourse of Antwerp. Originally built 1531; extensively restored 1872; now Antwerp Trade Fair.\nPalace of Justice, designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006. This building is the antithesis of the heavy, dark court building, designed by Joseph Poelaert, which dominates the skyline of Brussels. The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built on the site of the old Zuid (\"South\") station, at the end of a magnificent 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12). The building's highest 'sail' is 51 m (167 ft) high, has a floor area of 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft), and cost \u20ac130 million.\nZurenborg, a late-19th-century Belle \u00c9poque neighbourhood, on the border of Antwerp and Berchem, with many Art Nouveau architectural elements. The area counts as one of the most original Belle \u00c9poque urban expansion areas in Europe.\nMuseum aan de Stroom\nDen Botaniek or Antwerp's Botanical Garden, created in 1825. Located in the city centre, at the Leopoldstraat, it covers an area of almost 1 hectare.\nHarmonium Art museuM, a museum on pump organs in Klein-Willebroek\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (M HKA)\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\n\nAlthough Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former enceinte, only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. A replica of a castle named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais in the 19th century.\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:\n\n10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch\n12th and 13th century: canals (so called \"vlieten\" and \"ruien\") were made\n16th century: Spanish fortifications\n19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications\n20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\nThis is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.\n\n\n=== Minorities ===\nIn 2010, 36% to 39% of the inhabitants of Antwerp had a migrant background. A study projects that in 2020, 55% of the population will be of migrant background.\n\n\n==== Jewish community ====\n\nAfter The Holocaust and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic, live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff  (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk, based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Ger, Skver, Klausenburg, Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\n==== Jain community ====\n\nThe Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business. Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds. A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk).  Mr Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a full-fledged member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nThere are significant Armenian communities that reside in Antwerp, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with a smaller numbers are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church.\nOne of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel and involved in is the diamond trade business, that based primarily in the diamond district. Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nAccording to the American Association of Port Authorities, the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014\u20132020.  The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.\n\n\n=== Diamonds ===\nAntwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion. The city has four diamond bourses: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers. Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian and Maronite Christian from Lebanon and Armenian, traders become increasingly important.Antwerp World Diamond Centre, (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry. However, in recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nA six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to Brussels, Hasselt and Li\u00e8ge, Ghent, Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"Oosterweelconnection\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to Amsterdam and Paris, and national trains to Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Brussels, Charleroi, Hasselt, Li\u00e8ge, Leuven and Turnhout.\nAntwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald's haunting novel Austerlitz. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"premetro\" and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nA small airport, Antwerp International Airport, is located in the district of Deurne, with passenger service to various European destinations. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre.\nThe now defunct VLM Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport. This office is also CityJet's Antwerp office. When VG Airlines (Delsey Airlines) existed, its head office was located in the district of Merksem.Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport, is about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.\nThere is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs twice every hour on working days.\nThe runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.\nIn September 2019 Air Antwerp began operations with their first route to London City Airport with old VLM Airlines Fokker 50's.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections.\nThe current majority consists of N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld, led by mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA).\n\n\n=== Former mayors ===\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century important mayors include Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Nicolaas II Rockox.\nIn the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti\u00e8ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (New Flemish Alliance).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntwerp has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) similar to that of Southern England, while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) average highs for both July and August. Winters are more dominated by the maritime currents instead, with temps being heavily moderated.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAntwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its school of painting, which included Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the Teniers and many others.\n\nInformally, most Antverpians (in Dutch Antwerpenaren, people from Antwerp) speak Antverpian daily (in Dutch Antwerps), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other Brabantic dialects for its characteristic pronunciation of vowels: an 'aw' sound approximately like that in 'bore' is used for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the 'a' in 'hat'. The Echt Antwaarps Teater (\"Authentic Antverpian Theatre\") brings the dialect on stage.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nAntwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in the world. It has served as the learning centre for many Belgian fashion designers. Since the 1980s, several graduates of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts have become internationally successful fashion designers in Antwerp. The city has had a huge influence on other Belgian fashion designers such as Raf Simons, Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Theyskens and Kris Van Assche.\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nAntwerp is famous for its local products. In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally \"Antwerp Hands\". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.\n\n\n=== Missions to seafarers ===\nA number of Christian missions to seafarers are based in Antwerp, notably on the Itali\u00eblei. These include the Mission to Seafarers, British & International Sailors' Society, the Finnish Seamen's Mission, the Norwegian Sj\u00f8mannskirken and the Apostleship of the Sea. They provide cafeterias, cultural and social activities as well as religious services.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAntwerp is the home of the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC), founded in 1938 and located on the square Grote Markt since 1994.The band dEUS was formed in 1991 in Antwerp. dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material. Their musical influences range from folk and punk to jazz and progressive rock.\n\n\n=== Music festivals ===\nCultuurmarkt van Vlaanderen is a musical festival and a touristic attraction that takes place annually on the final Sunday of August in the city center of Antwerp. Where international and local musicians and actors, present their stage and street performances.Linkerwoofer is a pop-rock music festival located at the left bank of the Scheldt. This music festival starts in August and mostly local Belgian musicians play and perform in this event.Other popular festivals Fire Is Gold, and focuses more on urban music, and Summerfestival.\n\n\n=== World Choir Games ===\nThe city of Antwerp will co-host the 2020 World Choir Games together with the city of Ghent. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAntwerp held the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were the first games after the First World War and also the only ones to be held in Belgium. The road cycling events took place in the streets of the city.Royal Antwerp F.C., currently playing in the Belgian First Division, were founded in 1880 and is known as 'The Great Old' for being the first club registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1895. Since 1998, the club has taken Manchester United players on loan in an official partnership. Another club in the city was Beerschot VAC, founded in 1899 by former Royal Antwerp players. They played at the Olympisch Stadion, the main venue of the 1920 Olympics. Nowadays KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk plays at the Olympisch Stadion in the Belgian Second Division.\nThe Antwerp Giants play in Basketball League Belgium and Topvolley Antwerpen play in the Belgium men's volleyball League.\nFor the year 2013, Antwerp was awarded the title of European Capital of Sport.\nAntwerp hosted the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nAntwerp hosted the start of stage 3 of the 2015 Tour de France on 6 July 2015.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\nAntwerp has a university and several colleges. The University of Antwerp  (Universiteit Antwerpen) was established in 2003, following the merger of the RUCA, UFSIA and UIA institutes. Their roots go back to 1852. The University has approximately 23,000 registered students, making it the third-largest university in Flanders, as well as 1,800 foreign students. It has 7 faculties, spread over four campus locations in the city centre and in the south of the city.\nThe city has several colleges, including Antwerp Management School (AMS), Charlemagne University College (Karel de Grote Hogeschool), Plantin University College (Plantijn Hogeschool), and Artesis University College (Artesis Hogeschool). Artesis University College has about 8,600 students and 1,600 staff, and Charlemagne University College has about 10,000 students and 1,300 staff. Plantin University College has approximately 3,700 students.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nThe following places are twinned with or sister cities to Antwerp:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Born in Antwerp ===\n\n\n=== Lived in Antwerp ===\n\n\n== Select neighbourhoods ==\nDen Dam \u2013 an area in northern Antwerp\nThe diamond district \u2013 an area consisting of several square blocks, it is Antwerp's centre for the cutting, polishing, and trading of diamonds\nLinkeroever \u2013 Antwerp on the left bank of the Scheldt with a lot of apartment buildings\nMeir \u2013 Antwerp's largest shopping street\nVan Wesenbekestraat \u2013 the city's Chinatown\nHet Zuid \u2013 the south of Antwerp, notable for its museums and Expo grounds\nZurenborg \u2013 an area between Central and Berchem station with a concentration of Art Nouveau townhouses\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntwerp Book Fair\nAntwerp lace\nAntwerp Water Works (AWW)\nJewish Community of Antwerp\nLetterenhuis\nList of mayors of Antwerp\nPshevorsk \u2013 Hassidic Jewish movement based in Antwerp\nRoyal Antwerp F.C., local football club\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nBlanchard, Ian.

          "There\u2019s nothing to do once you get to the Port Authority other than to admire the building, but what a fabulous building it is! We enjoy walking, so a sunny stroll along the river bank with a rewarding sight at the end was a very pleasant afternoon.",
          "We took the water bus, which is near the Grote Market. For a few Euro you can tour the entire port and the Schelde River. The boats are clean and modern and very fast. The conductor suggested a small island and town about 5 stops into the trip for a quick bite a a quaint cafe",
          "This building is an eye-catcher. A glassy modern kind of ship above an old square stone building. What a mix!, a combination of modern and old stuff. It's nice to see. We took a little walk on the area. There are three donkey statues on the square, decorated garbage bins and a",
          "This is a neat part of Antwerp with some cool history. I could walk around or sit and watch the ships/barges all day long.",
          "As you sail down the Western Scheldt it is mainly industrial, ideal if looking at chemical plants are your thing,",
          "What an amazing site, which has restaurants, ports, yachts, ships, all in one place. from there you can view the church.",
          "I walked further into the port from the Red Line Museum to checkout the Port Authority Building which is stunning. There are other statues and things to see on the way. It's a bit of a walk from the city centre but worth it to appreciate the scale of the port.",
          "Nice and tiny quartier, full of history and red bricks. Easy to reach from the city center, it gives you the idea how important and developed was this city in the recent past.",
          "The cruise terminal was modern and convenient, we were right next to the big ferris wheel and across from a hop on hop off stop.",
          "Whatever the weather, it's worth visiting the old town of Antwerp and walking around. It's rich with history.There are loads of pubs and eateries. There are restaurants serving an array of cuisine e.g; Italian, Belgian,Desserts,french fries(fritter) ,Indian,Falafel,etc. The",
          "Antwerp's Port was a great place to take a break, sit on a bench and watch watercraft go by. We lunched on ham and cheese sandwiches and and a bag of birdfeed for the gulls, ducks, starlings and seagulls. Imthink we sat there several hoirs so much to watch, water barges, water",
          "No visit to a city is complete without walking along its shores. Antwerp is no exception. Once you're done walking the markets and visiting the museums go for a walk along the banks of the Scheldt river. You can relax on a bench, watch joggers and bikers, or sit and wonder",
          "Rich with history Antwerp\u2019s Grote Markt is a must visit! The bridge of the port is lovely and going down by the water on a weekend means there is a lovely market! You can have fresh waffles or oysters by the North Sea!",

          "We toured it with a guide then headed back into the city to see more on our own. Definitely lots to see in this city",
          "Clearly the welcome at Antwerp's port area depends on whether there is a ship in port (on both days we were there there was not). It was thus very empty and sparse. It was good to get down to the river and there is a separate pedestrian friendly walkway with many seats. Just",
          "I really recommend all tourists to visit the port, by boat of course. The port in fact is the real heart of this nice town: millions of goods arrived in this port every year. You can find some huge ships (oil tankers of 180/220 mt length), big structures, towers of containers as",

          "This is a fabulous port as you can get off the ship and walk to everything. The view of the city coming in and out is outstanding.",
          "this is a city of diamond shopping. we have stay here for many hours, and see yours building, places and streets.",
          "A lovely city well served by trams frequently transversing the city streets. We stopped at the port whilst on a cruise visiting Antwerp, Rouen and Le Harve. Antwerp was by far the best of the bunch. We arrived early in the day, before most of the city was awake, but as the city",
          "We took this walk to see the port and river. The views were breathtaking. We could see all of Antwerp in one panoramic view. The walk is level and easy to do. Our 80 year old Aunt had no trouble walking the distance. At the end are some nice restaurants. Have a nice beer",
          "For me it wasn't something special. No huge boats, no even small boats. Nothing. Just a promenade to walk, but for me it also seemed dull.",

          "Not sure whether this attraction refers to the pleasure boat marina or the commercial docks. If the latter, as Europe's 2nd largest port it's worth taking a cruise around if you can find one as the sheer scale of it and variety of vessels is fascinating. If we're reviewing the",
          "Port area is a little disappointing as its mostly industrial and commercial shipping. there are a few areas with smaller boats which are nice though. The only real plus is that there are a number of very good restaurants in the area well worth visiting.",
          "I have been here many a times, during my sailing carrier. Just loved the Port for its Mega Size, its management & the number of ships it could handle. One of the best ports in the World. Antwerp's docks are connected to the hinterland by rail, road, and river and canal",

          "On a river cruise from Amsterdam, we were in Antwerp's port, March 30th. Where the ship docked was only a few blocks from the center of Antwerp. It is an amazing city. We took a walking tour in the morning which was a short walk from Antwerp's Port. We ate lunch at a Belgium",
          "Great walk around the harbor and only minutes away from central square. Plenty of restaurants to choose from with fresh seafood on offer.",
          "We took a boat tour of Antwerp's port and learned so much about what actually happens here. It's amazing to think about the inner workings of such an important part of our every day lives.",
          "Though it being near crowded tourists spots and near the sea, there wasn't any crowd here as one would expect. The water was clean and not even it was crowded with boats or ships. And being near the sea, this place was really peaceful and calm. Would recommend for the quiet",
          "It`s nice to spend the day there, go to the MAS museum and then drink someting at the Bar Paniek. Nice atmosphere.",

          "The old port of Antwerp boasts some really historic buildings but it is the new buildings which startle and amaze. One of them appears to have a glass hull of a large ship on it roof. As the light or the sun catches the different glass panels there are reflections which are",
          "We stopped for a quick visit to Anvers on the way to Amsterdam. The port is definitely a must see, with great scenery some nice old boats.. We loved it!",
          "Lots of different ways to visit the second largest port in Europe. Suggest to start with the docks around the MAS and gradually make your way up north to the Red Star Line Museum and the iconic building of the Port House, the final masterpiece of Zaha Hadid.",
          "This new building will become the iconic spot in Antwerp and you cannot miss it. pedestrian access it is not ready yet but not too difficult to reach there. Close to MAS museum so organise the two visits together. Tours have been sold out for next few months...so I will come",

          "Useful and impressive huge port. Come and take a look at how vivid and crowded can be such an important port. Also very close to city centre, another reason why to take a visit.",
          "Antwerp port is very large. It is not used as much as it used to be but still gets some very big shipping going through it. You can find several old (disused ) cranes on the shire as well as plenty of modern day infrastructure. Worth a visit just to see its size.",
          "Antwerp is one of the major ports of the world and served by just about every major shipping line. Taking a boat around the port is a very good experience and there are some interesting places to see. Very historical.",
          "Went on a business trip to see the steel loading terminal. The terminal itself is very efficient with some of the best Stevedores in Europe (Kateon Natie, NHS) but this was not exactly a relaxing trip",
          "Get a great view of this centuries-old city and walk over to the Antwerp Castle on the Shelde River. Great views!",
          "For the sake of clarity, this place is about the modern, 21st century, port and NOT the historical one that some people described here. If you want to see the old port you have to head downtown. So, this port is \"open\", meaning that you can drive around and see how boats are",
          "The city centre is by far more interesting than the port, but yet again this is an industrial port and not a tourist one. The good news is that this is in walking distance from most attractions and you can get into some really good places to grab a bite.",
          "Love this place very beautiful place will always visit it for clean air and beautiful water and the wind",
          "Met Luc in Cafe Pelikaan (check the bar out) and he offered to drive around his workplace - the Port. Gave us an idea of the scale - huge hangars full of goods.",
          "Absolutely fabulous 3 night cruise from Southampton to Antwerp. Food was fantastic and all the cabin crew was brilliant. Antwerp itself was a bit disappointing, especially the Christmas market. Couldn't wait to get back on board.",
          "The waterfront is the only remains of a historic port. When I came here the first time, I was gullible enough to think that this was a real port. But. no. It's some 17th century affair. Anyways, the boardwalk is long enough for a nice jog. To meet some really cool athletes, come",
          "Efficient disembarking and embarking. Terminal was warm and manned by friendly and helpful staff. Only a short walk across the road to the centre so easily managed even if you have mobility difficulties.",
          "Fabulous waterfront , great views , history and architecture along the route , walkway not accessible to the disabled though as far as I could see",
          "Antwerp's port is very large and would be suited to a dry day, (it was raining when we visited). There were still a large selection of boats of all sizes to look at, including a lightship, large sea going sailing ships, and private boats of all sizes. The architecture",
          "The port of Antwerp is one of the biggest ports of Europe. At the background you can see the historical Antwerp sky line, really great to see.",
          "Although , no ships visible when we were there , turn to the right and photograph the castle Turn 180 degrees , look back towards the city , and see some wonderful photo opportunities looking back towards, the cathedral",
          "Weird place. Not obvious for me why people consider this being the sights and why they visit this place.",
          "it was a splendid walk around tour at Antwerp port city in Belgium in Jan 2012 ..... an awesome walk around tour covering a long part of the port city... me with a friend of same frequency of traveler mentality traveled across the city, and believe me, the best of my travel",
          "Great city. The hot spot of Europe for fashion food and dinning and art. Every alley you turned down there were amazing restaurants. There is a theatre for performing arts. Great shopping for the newest and hottest fashion. The Great Cathedral had an amazing Rubens exhibit",
          "Stop by the MAS museum first because outside the Port people put on a diorama exhibit and short talk about the Port including a map and other handouts. Port is fascinating and highlights the importance to Europe",
          "Fabulous afternoon on board one of the boats taking us along the second largest industrial ports in the world, China being the first. Very good value for money, refreshments can be obtained downstairs. We enjoyed the trip very much.",
          "All the amenities, including captain Tony at the captianary! He's a delight! A word of advice for boat persons visiting, find out the hours for coming in and leaving.",
          "We toured the port on a 1 -1/2 hour boat trip from the dock near the RED Star Museum. Obviously weather dependent but it was a surprisingly interesting trip - though there was no English information (only Flemish speakers got any information)",
          "Great place to visit plenty to do with many shops,bars restaurants Easy to get around a must if your visiting Belgium",
          "Massively busy port with lots of large barges and ships to watch. We actually travelled through this port on our small canal boat, so we found the currents, tides and river traffic a tad overwhelming. However, we loved staying at Willemdok and watching them parade of boats --",
          "A true citizen of Antwerp doesn't know its port. Sounds strange? Yes it does! The port is actually far bigger in surface area than the city itself. Looking at it at first, it is not very attractive: here are situated the crumb of petrochemical, chemical and biochemical companies",
          "The port area is a little off the tourist track in Antwerp, but it's sometimes nice to get away from the crowds and enjoy some fresh air. There are also a lot of bars and restaurants along the river and the food tends to be better than in the more touristy parts of the City.",
          "There is not a lot to see here, especially the part nearest the city centre. However, it is interesting to see how big the area is and also it has an old castle and plenty of cafes nearby. The industrial part of the port can be seen in the distance.",
          "Lovely place where to walk. It's like 30 minutes journey starting from the big square's Cathedral and get to the bottom boardwalk. Walking through some of the important spots like the Steen Castle and the marine area. Not much to see except few things but it's a pleasant way to",
          "Andrwerp in Belgium was so beautiful everywhere you looked was like a town in a fairytale. The Cobblestone roads and the unique shops and scenery was unforgettable.",
          "A good place for a city break away from all the tourists. Not heaving with sights but enough to keep amused and the bars all sell great beers to while away the time and people watch.",
          "Enjoyed Cathedral of our Lady, the lovely city center, great city - would love to spend more time there.",
          "miss this one - save the time. Just an area of unfinished car parks there is nothing to see really. They have built a cafe for the incoming cruise ships but that is all. Sometimes they have small fairs but nothing special.",
          "Nice to see a port in the center of the city. Should experience the cold breeze in the night on top of the port...",
          "This is a great area / location for everyone to spend sometime going for a casual walk along the waterways and find an establishment to enjoying few drinks or a meal.",
          "2.5-hour boat ride through the docks gives you the reason why Antwerp is what it is. Find a seat on front of the boat.",
          "Antwerp is a diamond capital and worth a visit... it has good restaurants and the city is very nice and the architecture is good....there are amny restaurants and we could eat in an indian restaurent in antwerp...",
          "Antwerp airport's special thing is caffe of next to airport. In the airport you will see very goof restaurant and you cansee whole runway and airport. It's so inspirational",
          "With over 130 square kilometers (over 50 square miles), the place is way too big to visit. I presume the intention is the stroll between the 'Steen' and the Hangar, which is nice stroll, but I'd choose for the elevated path where available.",
          "Antwerp was the scariest and sketchiest town we visited during our week in Belgium. I'd lived there before and it didn't seem so scary but walking through now, seeing the red light district which makes your skin crawl at 2 pm because the men and women there are concerning, and",
          "Our River Cruise ship moored here and it was only a ten minute walk to the city centre. The port area is clean and tidy and undergoing many improvements at the present time. The journey in through the lock was especially interesting.",
          "We went on the port bus tour on a rainy day and were glad to do so, however we were delighted by both the tour and our tour guide. This is a must do if you are in the city for any time at all, we rate it as five stars.",
          "The city in general is well worth a visit. From my arrival at the beautiful train station I was impressed. I then spent many hours wandering the city. I explored the outdoor shopping area, a few cafes, shopped in many of the artisan boutiques, and enjoyed a spectacular meal or",
          "We discovered the Antwerp Port Tours motor coach tour online while searching for some way to see the massive port during the winter months. We found the tour to be unique and really well-executed. The bus leaves at 1, 3, and 5pm, Wed. - Sun. from by the flags in front of the MAS",
          "The entire area of the old harbour district is stunning. One of the best many dining locations. Even spare ribs are a classic, with homemade BBQ jerk. Delicious! Antwerp is the worlwide top location for Belgium chocolate and pralinees and for the Jewish diamond trade with",
          "Something for everyone here. Visited weekend before Christmas specifically for the Markets. ice rink, small fun fair, lots of well presented stalls, large ferris wheel & of course Gluhwein! A great way to escape the UK for a weekend. The port is located at the bottom of the main",
          "The Port and the area around it is very vibrant. There are many bars around and the port has a very rustic feel to it with a few old warehouses and so on. Spend some time taking a walk here, especially in Summer.",
          "Went on Brittany ferries to antwerp over Christmas ,lovely ship,arrived antwerp 2.00 pm Christmas day every where open wonderful time. Boxing Day all day lovely City back day after 2.00 pm well worth the money \u00a3175 try it",
          "The port of Antwerp is an amazing environment... Firstly You have the so called \"Old Port\" around the Bonapartedok, Willemdok and Kattsndijkdok. This area is in full transformation with a lot of bars and restaurant in old warehouses. Unfortunately there are not so many of",
          "A place what everyone should look. Not a big attraction, but a quite place where you can feel good atmosphere.",
          "Our cruise ship was able to dock right in the town, so it was easy to get on and off at will. There was a lovely bridge and a castle in the distance",
          "We came from Namur on a WWI pilgrimage. Namur was an unexpected high point in our trip. The Engineer museum was astonishing! Vincent as our guide was wonderful! We will go back! Have to go back! Please can we import him for our trip. The museum is only open on a Wednesday but",
          "A port of call on our cruise, Antwerp's port is a short walk away from the main shopping area. The port is easy to manouvre - just watch out for the cyclists! We visited the main cathedral, which was just stunning, before heading off to sample Belgian Hot Chocolate and buy some",
          "We had a 3 hour cruise of the port of Antwerp, the second biggest in Europe after Rotterdam. It is slightly interesting in the first 30 minutes and then becomes quite dull. How many containers with bananas can you keep on spotting? It must be fantastic if you are fond of tankers",
          "It was just the first place I stayed in Europe. Oh Antwerp Port. It was magical, and a great economical site. There you're near to everything. Few steps forward and you will have everything you need. It's a great place for long walks, breath and relax, the scenic view is all",
          "I have visited the Port of Antwerp many time in business and by now it feels very much home. A very important European port which is to consider as a gateway out and in. Port of Antwerp is the third biggest port in Europe after Hamburg and Rotterdam and many important shipping",
          "We had a tour on the flandria boats around the port, impressive and interesting. You get a good idea of the activities and incredible business around If you have a little time, enjoye",
          "a nice place to take a walk with friends at sunset, windy though. Take a jacket along. Enjoy watching the population coming and going...just appreciate the time and the company.",
          "I enjoyed walking by the port, especially given my interest in shipping and the historical significance it represents here. I kinda walked by it quickly, and that's it. There isn't to much to do here, per se.",
          "The Port area at Antwerp is not a pretty place. The area looks like it has not been touched for many years. There is some works underway but it looks like it will be many years until this becomes an interesting place to visit.",
          "We walked to the port but you can also take public transport. The Museum Mas is an interesting building, moreover you can go up the escalators to reach the top floor with magnificient views of the city. Definitely well worth a visit.",
          "The our of the Port of Antwerp is really a great way to spend an afternoon. It was especially good for our family because we were accompanied by our friend and relative that used to work here. It was a beautiful sunny day and the harbour boat was very nice and clean.",
          "We took the train from Brussels and walked all over Antwerp. We covered miles but are fit so it wasn't a problem at all. We walked from the train station to the port going through the city center and enjoying all the old buildings and shops. The city is known for it's diamond",
          "Our tour was part of a canal tour, and it is huge. World War II in Europe was won from this port, as the Allies went across Europe most every thing needed came here. Know your History, it makes travel so much more fulfilling.",
          "my mum and I went on a cruise from Southampton to Antwerp it was a lovely few days and great places to visit to and we went on a tour bus which was very informative and had drinks and cake with a friend in a typical belguim tea room and when we departed the port a musical send",
          "Took the 3 hour afternoon boat trip with Flavian boats round the port which is amazing, if only for the vast area it cover (seems like 3 times the area of Antwerp city). Trip was 15 euros and well worth it. Commentary not amazing, but we had popped into the Port of Antwerp",
          "Antwerp is in the province of Belgium - located on the river Scheldt - a working port linked to the North Sea. In the 1st century AD the Gallo Romans vicus (provincial) civilisation settled (pottery and glass shards excavated in the 1950/1960s). After the Romans left around 4th",
          "It is a huge port. There are many places to see on right and left banks if you are interested. But I especially liked the old site of the port, old docks, craines and the old piers.",
          "My friend and I went on a mini cruise on Brittany ferries for Christmas. We docked in Antwerp on Christmas day and the town was buzzing. They had a Christmas market in full swing a fun fair and lots of stalls and lights to thrill everybody. The ship had docked on Christmas day",
          "I was not prepared to find on the riverside in the city the old port with all sign of transformation from the busy business place to the tourist attraction. In November it was completely empty... I imagine that summer time it may be a lively walking place.",
          "During a city trip to Antwerp, we took 1 day to get acquainted with the antwerp port side. Absolutely worthwhile. Best thing to do, is to start of from the north of Antwerp center toward the region they call \"Eilandje\", and then enter the actual heart of the port from there.",
          "Not far away from Grote Markt. Not more than half an hour along the river. Very beautiful. The MAS museum building reminds Centre Pompidou in Paris. Watch open hours if you want visit the museum, but the building is open till late. Go to last flour to see a panoramic view of",
          "It's not a \"Port\" in the traditional sense - it's massive beyond anything I have seen before. On a morning we must have seen well over 100 lorries during the 10 minute walk to the bus stop. Cranes and ships everywhere interspersed with little cafes.",
          "Admiring the sunset there was superb! There are many restaurants and bars nearby, so great place to hang out in the evening!",
          "After having lunch you can walk on the kai along the river and have the best view. You find a lot of interesting buildings in a mix of old and modern belgian architecture",
          "The port of Antwerp is a quiet and historic worth the visit and walk by, either before or after the typical fine dining.",
          "It is different to say that you have done the port as it goes on for miles up towards the sea. However, the main part is around the Mas Museum, where there are lots of boats moored, including the beautiful Marjorie - a three masted schooner - unless she is out on a cruise.",
          "We visited the harbor with two couples. Because of time constraints we could not take a boat and we drove with the intention to see the succession of locks on the right bank, they have grown bigger and bigger by the years. We started with the tiny ones at Willem- and",
          "a bit overrated. good views and a port sense of open space but nothing more than that. Visit only if u have time",
          "Just happened to see that there was a 2 1/2 hour trip round the port available: some uncertainty over where the tickets were being sold from but so glad we persevered: it was fascinating. Spacious boat, with drinks available. Descriptions in 4 languages, including English, but",
          "We booked the small harbour trip which lasted about two hours and cost 11 Euro. You start near the MAS and have to pass some bridges before you enter the harbour area. The audio presentation on board is in Flamish which is a pity. But you can sit and watch and just enjoy the",
          "For the second biggest port in Europe, its a place you could watch for hours because ther is always something going on, its a shame that the ferries from UK cannot dock there it would save a lot of time, just like ostend then you would have more time to enjoy the sites.",
          "Was not that impressed by this though the walk to get there was scenic and pleasant. The museum has an electronic guidance which is user friendly but too much to take in",
          "If you want to see this huge port you can book a cruise with Flandria boat company.It starts on Willem dock,right next to the MAS museum,continues on Albert dock,Leopold dock,Hansa dock and back via Haven dock.The terminus point is next to Londenbrug. Not very much to",
          "This was very much a city for people that live and work here. It's not really meant to be a tourist attraction. It was a very industrial town and we decided to come up for the day just for the sake of it as we were in Brussels and had some time on our hands. There was nothing",
          "It's not so beautiful at rechteroever but linkeroever is very good! Go under the water by metro or you can also walk in voetgangerstunnel. The best at the port is you can sit at the water and it's very when the weather is good! at the water you have free parking! In the winter",
          "All nice things can be visited by using public transport or just by a full day walk. Public transport is easy to use and rather cheap.",
          "Oh boy, what a delight! We woke up, opened our curtains and the window was full of a view of Antwerp cathedral. We had decided not to head of to Bruges and were so glad that we stayed in Antwerp. There where lots of small Christmas markets, brightly lit trees, squares all decked",
          "Yes, Antwerp has one of the busiest ports in Europe, but there's not much to see as a tourist. The real commercial harbour has long ago left the city and moved north about 20km. The harbour in the city itself is deserted.",
          "Close to the port there is a nice Castle and some goods restaurants. It's nice to visiti the port but nothing special.",
          "I had a great day going to the MAS (museum) which is in the port area. The port area is one of the next new places for restaurants, bars, dance, and is great to walk around especially since the port is a very important part of Antwerp's past and future.",
          "Well worth the 2.5 hour cruise during which one sees the different docks in the Antwerp Port. Guide made the tour interesting and informative.",
          "The Port Of Antwerp is really impressionant! The tours organised by the boat company Flandria are good but also interesting is a tour with the people of the Port's Center (Havencentrum) in Lillo a small village in the middle of the port. The drive around with you and show you",
          "Great to see ships come and go. If you like some ship spotting, I know some nice places where you can go.",
          "We went on the Flandia line harbour cruise for over 3 hours. The harbour is enormous, and there are some really big ships to look at. The container ships are the most exciting, but you can also see coal and salt being loaded, and a oil refinery. The harbour trip involves",
          "We'd had enough of site seeing and needed a sit down so decided to take the longer of the two docks tours run by the boat trip company Flandria. This was translated on the advertising board as a 'harbour tour' so in our head was a picture of just going out of the port and",
          "There are some boats to look at, but also look for the small painted \"mushrooms\". If you happen to be there, I am sure you will find them. Oh and also visit the museum with wavy glass windows and try to find the \"biscuit house\" on the left of the port.",
          "The Antwerp harbor is not a beauty, but it contains a lot of industrial heritage sites, two fortresses (i.e., Lillo and Liefkenshoek) and at least one \"ghost village\" (i.e., Doel), that reached this depressing state due to the seemingly never-expanding expansion of the harbor.",
          "We had a great time, locals made us feel very welcome, though the cobbles are not smart car friendly!",
          "I walked for a long time along the port with my sis, A little bit cold in August. I saw a huge cruise ship over there.",
          "The flandria boats give a tour in the harbor. The harbor itself is not nice to see, but as with any world port it is amazing. The flandria boats give you a nice time and good view of the industry.",
          "a lot of activity is going on in Antwerp's Port as it is one of the largest ones in the world. We did a trip by car and had an excursion by boot We ate in \"spek en eieren\" (bacon and eggs) and enjoyed the place aswell as the people",
          "Thanx to port management. they gave all the details. Not boring at all even u may not be into ports or containers. It makes u understand why antwerp is a trade city",
          "The best way to visit the port of antwerp is by boat. You can book a tour nearby at Flandria for a guided tour in the port of Antwerp for 50 minutes (short tour) for only around 10\u20ac. It gives you a small impression of the old harbour fading into the modern harbour and the pretty",
          "Antwerp Port has the largest land area of any port in the world. Other than a world class port they have villages in the port area. Some fantastic restaurants and the MAS Museum which brings the people of Antwerp closer to the Port. A pleasure just to walk or cycle in the port",
          "Antwerp Port is one of the largest in the wsorld, and has some surprises, including nature reserves where birds of all sorts stay and bread. I did not know that; on top of that is offers some great cycling routes, and is quiet during the weekend... Visit LILLO, the smallest",
          "You can enjoy nice views from the promenade deck at the Antwerp port and you can also make boatrips in the harbour area which are interesting",
          "As far as medievil city goes Antwerpen (Antwerp for non flemish) is quite a nice port town. Unpretentious, and easy to navigate, the old city is filled with history and the Old Castle, is an example of a real (not petty) working castle to servein defence of the city in a bygone",
          "This has so uch history built into the walls (and river). A great place to take a strole and look at the liners if any are in port. However, it can become deserted in the evenings and a hangout for young people drinking.",
          "The port is what made Antwerp great ! So have a visiting tour with for example a Flandria boat and relax while looking at the activity alongside the port.",
          "the best way to visit it is on bike, but if you cannot : take public transport : check the website of De Lijn, buy an inexpensive ticket and gawk. or spend some more money and take the boat : Flandria is offering several possibliities",
          "I really like the port (I like ports) but it's probably better not to go there at night since some parts are quite lonely then. However in the streets close to the port (the 'Kaaien') there are some nice restaurants and it's not far from the centre of town. I really love the",
          "We came in on a Fred Olsen cruise and you can walk to everything from the port -- its a great base location for touring Antwerp! Plus its in a very safe area! You should feel comfortable walking around here at any time of day!",
          "Is one the biggest in the whole world! We really liked it! deserve to go!",
          "The Antwerp Soho. You can see the MAS building with incredibly views of the city. Antiques shops and nice walk.",
          "If you are interested in doing something different other than looking at buildings and churches and crowds, I can highly recommend the boat cruise of Antwerp's Port. It is an absolutely HUGE place. The cruise took you around the different sections of this working harbour."

      "text": {
        "wiki": "A beguinage, from the French term b\u00e9guinage, is an architectural complex which was created to house beguines: lay religious women who lived in community without taking vows or retiring from the world.\nOriginally the beguine institution was the convent, an association of beguines living together or in close proximity of each other under the guidance of a single superior, called a mistress or prioress. Although they were not usually referred to as \"convents\", in these houses dwelt a small number of women together: the houses small, informal, and often poor communities that emerged across Europe after the twelfth century. In most cases, beguines who lived in a convent agreed to obey certain regulations during their stay and contributed to a collective fund.In the first decades of the thirteenth century much larger and more stable types of community emerged in the region of the Low Countries: large court beguinages were formed which consisted of several houses for beguines built around a central chapel or church where their religious activities took place; these often included functional buildings such as a brewery, a bakery, a hospital, some farm buildings. Several of these beguinages are now listed by UNESCO as World Heritage sites. Around the mid-thirteenth century, the French king Louis IX founded a beguinage in Paris, which was modeled on the court beguinages of the Low Countries.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Oxford English Dictionary, citing Du Cange, gives the origin of the word \"beguine\" in the name of Lambert le B\u00e8gue, \"Lambert the Stammerer\", an early supporter of the movement who died around 1180.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nWhile a small beguinage usually constituted just one house where women lived together, a Low Countries court beguinage typically comprised one or more courtyards surrounded by houses, and also included a church, an infirmary complex, and a number of communal houses or 'convents'. From the twelfth through eighteenth centuries, every city and large town in the Low Countries had at least one court beguinage: the communities dwindled and came to an end, over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. They were encircled by walls and separated from the town proper by several gates, closed at night, but through which during the day the beguines could come and go as they pleased. Beguines came from a wide range of social classes, though truly poor women were admitted only if they had a wealthy benefactor who pledged to provide for their needs.\n\nThe understanding of women's motivations for joining the beguinages has changed dramatically in recent decades. The development of these communities is clearly linked to a preponderance of women in urban centers in the Middle Ages, but while earlier scholars like the Belgian historian Henri Pirenne believed that this \"surplus\" of women was caused by men dying in war, that theory has been debunked. Since the groundbreaking work of John Hajnal, who demonstrated that, for much of Europe, marriage occurred later in life and at a lower frequency than had previously been believed, historians have established that single women moved to the newly developed cities because those cities offered them work opportunities. Simons (2001) has shown how the smaller beguinages as well as the court beguinages answered such women's social and economic needs, in addition to offering them a religious life coupled with personal independence, which was a difficult thing to have for a woman.\n\n\n== In Belgium ==\n\nThirteen Flemish beguinages have been listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites since 1998.\n\n\n== Other beguinages ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBeguines and Beghards\nFrauenfrage, specifically associated with a medieval demographic period, in relation to women\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBelgium's beguinages offered refuge for women CNN",

        "wiki": "Antwerp Province (Dutch: Provincie Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen)) is the northernmost province both of the Flemish Region, also called Flanders, and of Belgium. It borders on (clockwise from the North) North Brabant province of the Netherlands and the Belgian provinces of Limburg, Flemish Brabant and East Flanders. Its capital is Antwerp which comprises the Port of Antwerp, which is the second largest seaport in Europe. It has an area of 2,876 km2 (1,110 sq mi) and with over 1.85 million inhabitants as of January 2019, it is the country's most populous province. The province consists of 3 arrondissements: Antwerp, Mechelen and Turnhout. The eastern part of the province comprises the main part of the Campine region.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the early Middle Ages the region was part of the Frankish Empire, which was divided into several pagi. The territory of the present day province belonged to several pagi of which the region around what would become the city of Antwerp belonged to the Pagus Renesium. The Pagus Toxandria stretched from North Brabant into the Campine region. To the south there was the Pagus Bracbatinse and the Pagus Hasbaniensis. In 843 the Carolingian Empire of Charlemagne was divided among his sons and the river Scheldt became the border between West Francia and East Francia. In 974 Otto II established the Margraviate of Antwerp as a defence against the County of Flanders.\n\nIn 1106, Henry V granted the Margraviate to Godfrey I of Leuven. His descendants would from 1235 onwards become the Dukes of Brabant and the region itself was the northern part of the Duchy of Brabant. In 1430 the Duchy became part of the Duchy of Burgundy until 1477 when it fell to the House of Habsburg. In 1713, at the end of the Spanish Succession War the region became part of the Austrian Netherlands until 1794, with in 1790 the short lived United States of Belgium. On 1 October 1795 the former Austrian Netherlands were annexed by France under the French Directory.\nThe modern province was created as the Department of the two Netes during the First French Empire (when the Southern Netherlands were part of France). After the defeat of Napoleon, the territory became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands as the province of Central Brabant, distinguishing it from North Brabant and South Brabant. In 1830, after Belgium's independence the province was renamed Antwerp (after its major city and capital).\n\n\n=== Prefects from 1800 until 1814 ===\nPrefects of the Department of the two Netes during the First French Empire\n\nMarquis Charles Joseph Fortun\u00e9 d'Herbouville (1800\u20131805)\nCharles Cochon (1805\u20131808)\nMarc Ren\u00e9 Marie de Voyer d'Argenson (1809\u20131813)\nBaron Jacques Fortunat de Savoye-Rollin (1813\u20131814)\n\n\n=== Governors from 1815 until 1830 ===\nGovernors of the province of Antwerp during the United Kingdom of the Netherlands\n\nCharles\u2013Louis van Keverberg van Kessel (1815\u20131817)\nPierre Joseph Pycke (1817\u20131820)\nLeonard Pierre Joseph du Bus de Gisignies (1820\u20131823)\nAndr\u00e9 Charles Membrede (1823\u20131828)\nEdmond Charles Giullaume Ghislain de la Coste (1828\u20131829)\nAlexandre Fran\u00e7ois Ghislain van der Fosse (1830)\n\n\n=== Governors since 1830 ===\nGovernors of the Belgian province of Antwerp \n\nFran\u00e7ois de Robiano (1830\u20131831)\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Tielemans (1831)\nCharles Rogier (1831\u20131832 and 1834\u20131840)\nHenri de Brouck\u00e8re (1840\u20131844)\nJules Malou (1844\u20131845)\nJan Teichmann (1845\u20131862)\nEdward Pycke d'Ideghem (1862\u20131887)\nCharles du Bois de Vroylande (1887\u20131888)\nEdward Osy de Zegwaart (1889\u20131900)\nFredegand Cogels (1900\u20131907)\nLouis de Brouchoven de Bergeyck (1907\u20131908)\nFerdinand de Baillet-Latour (1908\u20131912)\nGaston van de Werve de Schilde (1912\u20131923)\nGeorges Holvoet (1923\u20131945)\nRichard Declerck (1946\u20131966)\nAndries Kinsbergen (1967\u20131993)\nCamille Paulus (1993\u20132008)\nCathy Berx (since 2008)\n\n\n=== Population ===\n1846: 406,354\n1856: 434,485\n1866: 456,607\n1880: 577,232\n1890: 700,019\n1900: 819,159\n1910: 968,677\n1920: 1,016,963\n1930: 1,173,363\n1947: 1,281,333\n2008: 1,715,707\n2010: 1,744,862\n\n\n== Language ==\nAs in all Flemish provinces, the official and standard language of the Antwerp province is Dutch.

Historically, the traffic infrastructure was an important element of connecting the Port of Antwerp with the Ruhr Area in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Both the Iron Rhine railroad and the E313  (King Baudouin highway) and E34 highway connect Antwerp with the Ruhr Area.\nThe river Schelde, an important waterway, connects the Port of Antwerp with the North Sea. The Albert Canal connects the Scheldt in Antwerp with the Meuse and Li\u00e8ge. Other canals are the Canal Dessel \u2013 Kwaadmechelen, Schoten \u2013 Turnhout \u2013 Dessel, and Herentals \u2013 Bocholt which flows into the Nete canal.\nOf the International E-road network, the E313, E19, and E34 run through parts of the province. The Kennedy Tunnel and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel connect the highway network of the province with East Flanders and Ghent. In addition a new Oosterweelconnection is under consideration.\nThe railroads connect the major cities of the province, such as Antwerp, Mechelen, Herentals, Turnhout and Mol. The Iron Rhine connects Antwerp with M\u00f6nchengladbach in Germany. The new High Speed Train connects Antwerpen-Centraal railway station with Brussels (HSL 4) and Amsterdam (HSL-Zuid) at high speed. Antwerp International Airport, located in Deurne is a regional airport.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe province harbors several historical cities, such as Antwerp, Mechelen, Turnhout, Herentals and Lier. The Campine region is becoming a popular destination for tourists searching for a quiet and relaxed weekend. Old farms were transformed into bed and breakfast-hotels, the restaurant and caf\u00e9 business is very active and an ingenious network for bicycle tours has come to life the past few years. Here and there still up to several dozens acres of large heathland - and forests, such as the Kalmthoutse Heide (E: Kalmthout heathland) in Kalmthout, the moors around Turnhout, the Liereman (Oud-Turnhout) and the Prinsenpark in Retie. In a number of villages one can still see the typical Campine langgevelboerderijen (E: long facade farms).\n\n\n== Education and research ==\nThe province is home to several educational institutions and the University of Antwerp. Several research institutions are located in the province, such as the SCK\u2022CEN, the European Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) and the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO).\nInternational schools in Antwerp include Antwerp International School and Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais International d'Anvers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 88 billion \u20ac in 2018. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 41,900 \u20ac or 139% of the EU27 average in the same year.The Port of Antwerp is the economic heart of the province. Until the agricultural crisis of 1880, the eastern part of the province was a largely agricultural region. The industrial development of the eastern part of the province, part of the Campine region, started at the end of the 19th century when industry established itself in the region. The availability of cheap labor, new roads, canals, tramways and railroads such as the Iron Rhine, stimulated the settlement of new industry. Brick making industry alongside the canals, paper and printing business in Turnhout. Non-ferrous metallurgy in Balen-Nete, dynamite factories in Arendonk and Balen. Tobacco and cigar factories in Arendonk and the first shoe factory in Herentals. During the 1920s, the industrial expansion of the region continued with the radium and copper factories in Olen, the glass factory in Mol-Gompel and the diamond industry in Grobbendonk and Nijlen.\nIn the 20th century the first nuclear installation in Belgium was established at the SCK\u2022CEN in Mol in 1962. The European Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM), one of the EU Joint Research Centres, was founded in Geel in 1957 as a result of the Treaty of Rome. Innotek is a technology centre located in Geel and is part of the European Business and Innovation Centre Network (EBN). Industry in the Campine region of the province is mainly located alongside the E313, the E34 and the Albert Canal.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nThe unemployment rate stood at 5.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.\n\n\n=== Chemical industry ===\nAfter World War II the Port of Antwerp was expanded and on its premises several chemical factories and oil refineries were established, such as Bayer, BASF, Monsanto Company. The chemical and petrochemical industry is widely represented in the port region and comprises the world's second largest cluster of petrochemical industry, next to Houston (United States). In 1967 Amoco Chemical Belgium N.V., now BP, was founded in Geel.\nPharmaceutical industry was founded in Beerse in the 1960s, with Janssen Pharmaceutica and more recently with Genzyme in Geel. Soudal (silicon) in Turnhout and Ravago (plastics) in Arendonk became leading companies in their markets.\n\n\n=== Diamond ===\nThe diamond industry and trade is traditionally located in Antwerp. At the end of the 19th century Hendrik Cassiers founded a diamond cutting company outside Antwerp, in Grobbendonk. Hendrik Cassiers and Frans Dela Montagne laid the foundations of the diamond industry in the Campine region. The industry would settle in Nijlen, Herenthout, Bevel, Kessel, Vorselaar and Berlaar.\n\n\n=== Paper ===\nThe region around Turnhout became famous for its printing business, with companies such as Brepols, which roots date back to 1796 when Pieter Corbeels established his printing business in Turnhout. In 1833, Van Genechten N.V., Splichal N.V. in 1856, Mesmaekers Freres in 1859, Meses-Goris in 1872, L. Biermans in 1875, Poupaert in 1881, La Belgica N.V. in 1907, H. Proost & Co in 1913, J. Van Mierlo-Proost in 1918, Lityca in 1932 and Veloutex in 1951. More recently in 1970, Cartamundi was established, a world leader in playing cards.\n\n\n=== Metallurgies ===\nWhile Wallonia was famous for its steel industry, the Campine region became renowned for its non ferrous metallurgies. The Campine region was scarcely populated in the 19th century and with the availability of canals, the Iron Rhine and cheap labor, several metallurgies were established in the region. In 1888-1889 the metallurgy La Vieille Montagne was founded in Balen-Nete, close the Iron Rhine and the canal to Beverlo. The company had its roots in the exploitation of the zinc mines of Moresnet.\nThe Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale M\u00e9tallurgique de Hoboken in Olen, which was established along the Iron Rhine and the Albert Canal. The factory produced radium, cobalt and copper from the mines of the Union Mini\u00e8re in Katanga, Belgian Congo and Rhodesia. Along the canal Turnhout-Schoten the M\u00e9tallurgique de la Campine was established in 1910 for the production of lead and antimony. In 1919 La Metallo-Chimique was established which specialized in the production of copper.\n\n\n=== Glass ===\nIn 1872 the Sabli\u00e8res et Carri\u00e8res R\u00e9unies (SCR), now Sibelco, was founded to extract the silica sand layers in Mol for industrial applications (glass). In 1920 the glass bottle manufacture Beles R\u00e9unios was set up in Mol-Donk.\nIn 1921 a group of Belgian banks, the Mutuelle Mobili\u00e8re & Immobili\u00e8re, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique, the Banque de Bruxelles and the Financi\u00e8re de Transport together with the American group Libbey-Owens founded the Cie Internationale pour la fabrication m\u00e9canique de Verre in Mol Gompel. In 1931, due to the economic crisis, the company merged into Glaces et Verres (Glaver). In 1961 Glaver would merge with Univerbel into Glaverbel.\n\n\n=== Dynamite ===\nAs the Campine region was sparsely populated several dynamite factories were established in the region. In 1875, the Societe Anonyme d'Arendonk was established which premises would later become part of Ravago. In 1881 La Forcite N.V. was established near Balen, which was later acquired in 1920 by the Poudreries R\u00e9unies de Belgique (PRB). In 1887 a factory was founded near Herentals, which was closed due to the vicinity to the city. The factories produced explosives for the mines and quarries. The factories in the province are now closed down.\n\n\n=== Textile ===\nHistorically, wool processing industry was based on the wool from the sheep which were kept on the Campine heath. The centre of the textile industry in the province could be found in Turnhout. Wool processing companies such as Wolspinnerij Van Iersel, Spinnerij en Weverij Van Hoof and De Wollendekensfabriek Van Doren were located in Mol.\n\n\n=== Tobacco ===\nAt the end of the 19th century Arendonk became the centre of the tobacco industry. Additional factories were founded in Turnhout, Mol, Geel and Herentals. After World War II, the ALTO cigar factory was founded by Frans Van den Bergh who would also play an important role at Janssen Pharmaceutica.\n\n\n== Administrative subdivisions ==\n\nThe province is divided into three administrative arrondissements (arrondissementen in Dutch) containing 70 municipalities :\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntwerp Province Headquarters\nCIPAL\nList of schools in Antwerp\n\n\n== References ==\nSteve Heylen, Bart De Nil, Bart D\u2019hondt, Sophie Gyselinck, Hanne Van Herck en Donald Weber, Geschiedenis van de provincie Antwerpen.

          "Nice location, excellent building and easy access. Located in a very central point in the city center.",
          "Splendid and beautiful, too bad it was undergoing some maintenance /repair during my visit. There\u2019s a cost of 6 euro to enter but if you are there to pray it\u2019s totally free. Suggest you pay the 6 euro as there\u2019s a difference with tourism and religious reason. Inside it\u2019s",

          "This station is well worth visiting in it own right even if you do not go near a train. It is kept absolutely spotless. It could do with some signposting but on the other hand this could destroy its ancient charm. If you go to Antwerp you must visit it.",
          "Centraal Station is large with trains on three levels conncted by escalators. Not very well signposted inside, e.g where taxis are. Number of exits which are confusing.",
          "The train station is a site to see all on its own. Even if you don't take the train, it is worth the visit. Just for fun, surf for the Flash Mob that was done in the station.",
          "One of the many amazing buildings of this fantastic city. I remember the station from the old days it looked like the inside of car exhaust. A huge reward should be given to the city of Antwerp for bringing it back to its former glory. I never thought it was possible.",
          "I\u2019ve never seen a railway station that is actually something to visit! Huge, well renovated, functional and right close to the zoo and the diamond streets. Must to see it!",

          "So we got off the train from Brussels, came up the elevator and just said wow! It\u2019s equally impressive from the exterior. If you don\u2019t need to take the train, it\u2019s still worth a visit just to see how things could be.",

        "wiki": "Antwerp ( (listen); Dutch: Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen); French: Anvers [\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281s] (listen)) is a city in Belgium and the capital of Antwerp province in the Flemish Region. With a population of 520,504, it is the most populous city proper in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people, it is the second largest metropolitan region after Brussels.Antwerp is on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe and within the top 20 globally. The city is also known for its diamond industry and trade.\nBoth economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt. Antwerp was also the place of the world's oldest stock exchange building, originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872.The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren (Dutch pronunciation: [s\u026a\u0272\u02c8jo\u02d0r\u0259(n)]), after the Spanish honorific se\u00f1or or French seigneur, \"lord\", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century. The city hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is New Latin.A Germanic (Frankish or Frisian) origin could contain prefix anda (\u201cagainst\u201d) and a noun derived from the verb werpen (\u201cto throw\u201d) and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit; a mound (like a terp) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf. If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean \"those who live on both banks\".There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river. He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt.\n\n\n=== Pre-1500 ===\nHistorical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952\u20131961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. The earliest mention of Antwerp dates from the 4th century.\nIn the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks.The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II, a border province facing the County of Flanders.\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon,  was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nAfter the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant, grew in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly enslaved Africans as the century progressed. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544\u20131574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became \"the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height.\" Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the \"Age of Exploration\". During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps.  Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas\".\n\nWithout a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venetian Republic, Republic of Ragusa, Spain and Portugal.  Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \"To the merchants of all nations.\" Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers.  In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth.  Numerous financial bankruptcies  began around 1557. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nThe religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries. The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury: 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over \u00a32 million sterling of damage was done.\n\n\n=== Dutch revolt ===\nSubsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa, and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock) and an access- lock and mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.\n\nIn 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chass\u00e9. For a time Chass\u00e9 subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass\u00e9 made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi)  from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAntwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During World War I, the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Li\u00e8ge. The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.\nAntwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. \nDuring World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote, V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic) Orthodox Judaism.\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into nine entities (districts):\n\nAntwerp\nBerchem\nBerendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo\nBorgerhout\nDeurne\nEkeren\nHoboken\nMerksem\nWilrijkIn 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp, the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.\n\n\n== Buildings and landmarks ==\n\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was noted for the wealth of its citizens (\"Antwerpia nummis\"). The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the Hanseatic League on the northern quays, in 1891. During World War II, the city also suffered considerable damage from V-bombs, and in recent years, other noteworthy buildings have been demolished for new developments.\n\nAntwerp Zoo opened in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the world.\nAntwerp City Hall dates from 1565, and is built primarily in Renaissance style.\nAntwerp Central Station is a railway station designed by Louis Delacenserie which was completed in 1905.\nCathedral of Our Lady.

The church has four works by Rubens, viz. \"The Descent from the Cross\", \"The Elevation of the Cross\", \"The Resurrection of Christ\" and \"The Assumption\"\nSt. James' Church, is more ornate than the cathedral. It contains the remains of numerous famous nobles, among them a major part of the family of Rubens.\nThe Church of St. Paul has a baroque interior. It is a few hundred yards north of the Grote Markt\nSt. Andrew's Church\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church\nMuseum Vleeshuis (Butchers' Hall) is a fine Gothic brick-built building, situated a short distance to the North-West of the Grote Markt.\nPlantin-Moretus Museum preserves the house of the printer Christoffel Plantijn and his successor Jan Moretus\nThe Saint-Boniface Church is an Anglican church and headseat of the archdeanery North-West Europe.\nBoerentoren (Farmers' Tower) or KBC Tower, a 26-storey building built in 1932, is the oldest skyscraper in Europe. It is the tallest building in Antwerp and the second tallest structure after the Cathedral of our Lady. The building was designed by Emiel van Averbeke, R. Van Hoenacker and Jos Smolderen.\nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts\nMuseum Mayer van den Bergh, with works from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nRubenshuis is the former home and studio of Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) in Antwerp.

Originally built 1531; extensively restored 1872; now Antwerp Trade Fair.\nPalace of Justice, designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006. This building is the antithesis of the heavy, dark court building, designed by Joseph Poelaert, which dominates the skyline of Brussels. The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built on the site of the old Zuid (\"South\") station, at the end of a magnificent 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12). The building's highest 'sail' is 51 m (167 ft) high, has a floor area of 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft), and cost \u20ac130 million.\nZurenborg, a late-19th-century Belle \u00c9poque neighbourhood, on the border of Antwerp and Berchem, with many Art Nouveau architectural elements.

Located in the city centre, at the Leopoldstraat, it covers an area of almost 1 hectare.\nHarmonium Art museuM, a museum on pump organs in Klein-Willebroek\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (M HKA)\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\n\nAlthough Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former enceinte, only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. A replica of a castle named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais in the 19th century.\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:\n\n10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch\n12th and 13th century: canals (so called \"vlieten\" and \"ruien\") were made\n16th century: Spanish fortifications\n19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications\n20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\nThis is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.\n\n\n=== Minorities ===\nIn 2010, 36% to 39% of the inhabitants of Antwerp had a migrant background. A study projects that in 2020, 55% of the population will be of migrant background.\n\n\n==== Jewish community ====\n\nAfter The Holocaust and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic, live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff  (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk, based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Ger, Skver, Klausenburg, Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\n==== Jain community ====\n\nThe Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business. Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds. A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk).  Mr Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a full-fledged member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nThere are significant Armenian communities that reside in Antwerp, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with a smaller numbers are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church.\nOne of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel and involved in is the diamond trade business, that based primarily in the diamond district. Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nAccording to the American Association of Port Authorities, the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014\u20132020.  The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.\n\n\n=== Diamonds ===\nAntwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion. The city has four diamond bourses: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers. Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian and Maronite Christian from Lebanon and Armenian, traders become increasingly important.Antwerp World Diamond Centre, (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry. However, in recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nA six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to Brussels, Hasselt and Li\u00e8ge, Ghent, Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"Oosterweelconnection\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to Amsterdam and Paris, and national trains to Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Brussels, Charleroi, Hasselt, Li\u00e8ge, Leuven and Turnhout.\nAntwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald's haunting novel Austerlitz. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"premetro\" and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nA small airport, Antwerp International Airport, is located in the district of Deurne, with passenger service to various European destinations. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre.\nThe now defunct VLM Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport. This office is also CityJet's Antwerp office. When VG Airlines (Delsey Airlines) existed, its head office was located in the district of Merksem.Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport, is about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.\nThere is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs twice every hour on working days.\nThe runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.\nIn September 2019 Air Antwerp began operations with their first route to London City Airport with old VLM Airlines Fokker 50's.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections.\nThe current majority consists of N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld, led by mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA).\n\n\n=== Former mayors ===\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century important mayors include Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Nicolaas II Rockox.\nIn the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti\u00e8ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (New Flemish Alliance).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntwerp has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) similar to that of Southern England, while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) average highs for both July and August. Winters are more dominated by the maritime currents instead, with temps being heavily moderated.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAntwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its school of painting, which included Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the Teniers and many others.\n\nInformally, most Antverpians (in Dutch Antwerpenaren, people from Antwerp) speak Antverpian daily (in Dutch Antwerps), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other Brabantic dialects for its characteristic pronunciation of vowels: an 'aw' sound approximately like that in 'bore' is used for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the 'a' in 'hat'. The Echt Antwaarps Teater (\"Authentic Antverpian Theatre\") brings the dialect on stage.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nAntwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in the world. It has served as the learning centre for many Belgian fashion designers. Since the 1980s, several graduates of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts have become internationally successful fashion designers in Antwerp. The city has had a huge influence on other Belgian fashion designers such as Raf Simons, Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Theyskens and Kris Van Assche.\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nAntwerp is famous for its local products. In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally \"Antwerp Hands\". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.\n\n\n=== Missions to seafarers ===\nA number of Christian missions to seafarers are based in Antwerp, notably on the Itali\u00eblei. These include the Mission to Seafarers, British & International Sailors' Society, the Finnish Seamen's Mission, the Norwegian Sj\u00f8mannskirken and the Apostleship of the Sea. They provide cafeterias, cultural and social activities as well as religious services.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAntwerp is the home of the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC), founded in 1938 and located on the square Grote Markt since 1994.The band dEUS was formed in 1991 in Antwerp. dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material. Their musical influences range from folk and punk to jazz and progressive rock.\n\n\n=== Music festivals ===\nCultuurmarkt van Vlaanderen is a musical festival and a touristic attraction that takes place annually on the final Sunday of August in the city center of Antwerp. Where international and local musicians and actors, present their stage and street performances.Linkerwoofer is a pop-rock music festival located at the left bank of the Scheldt. This music festival starts in August and mostly local Belgian musicians play and perform in this event.Other popular festivals Fire Is Gold, and focuses more on urban music, and Summerfestival.\n\n\n=== World Choir Games ===\nThe city of Antwerp will co-host the 2020 World Choir Games together with the city of Ghent. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAntwerp held the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were the first games after the First World War and also the only ones to be held in Belgium. The road cycling events took place in the streets of the city.Royal Antwerp F.C., currently playing in the Belgian First Division, were founded in 1880 and is known as 'The Great Old' for being the first club registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1895. Since 1998, the club has taken Manchester United players on loan in an official partnership. Another club in the city was Beerschot VAC, founded in 1899 by former Royal Antwerp players. They played at the Olympisch Stadion, the main venue of the 1920 Olympics. Nowadays KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk plays at the Olympisch Stadion in the Belgian Second Division.\nThe Antwerp Giants play in Basketball League Belgium and Topvolley Antwerpen play in the Belgium men's volleyball League.\nFor the year 2013, Antwerp was awarded the title of European Capital of Sport.\nAntwerp hosted the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nAntwerp hosted the start of stage 3 of the 2015 Tour de France on 6 July 2015.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\nAntwerp has a university and several colleges. The University of Antwerp  (Universiteit Antwerpen) was established in 2003, following the merger of the RUCA, UFSIA and UIA institutes. Their roots go back to 1852. The University has approximately 23,000 registered students, making it the third-largest university in Flanders, as well as 1,800 foreign students. It has 7 faculties, spread over four campus locations in the city centre and in the south of the city.\nThe city has several colleges, including Antwerp Management School (AMS), Charlemagne University College (Karel de Grote Hogeschool), Plantin University College (Plantijn Hogeschool), and Artesis University College (Artesis Hogeschool).

        "wiki": "The Atlantic Wall & Air War Bunker Museum Antwerp is a military war museum in Park den Brandt, Wilrijk (Antwerpen) in Belgium which preserves fortifications of the Atlantic Wall dating to the Second World War. In the Park a total of 8 bunkers are to be found.\n\n\n== Bunker Village ==\nThe Bunker Village was built during the Second World War for the Atlantic Wall in Belgium comprises eight bunkers of which three are open to the public. In total, two of the three bunkers developed into a full-fledged war museum with the Atlantic Wall and Air War as specialization.\n\n\n== The Bunkers ==\nBunker SK1, in which is the museum. This type of bunker, SK1 stands for Sonderkonstruktion 1, is seldom.\nBunker SK1 (Number 2), is not open to the public.\n5x Troopsbunker of Type VF52A, of which one is open to the public.\n1x Hospitalbunker of Type VF57A, open to the public.\n\n\n== War Museum ==\nThe actual museum of the bunker village is located in the Sonderkonstruktion 1 (SK1) bunker also the main command bunker of the Atlantic Wall in Belgium. In this museum are numerous archaeological pieces on display from several fortifications, a lot of documentation relating to the Atlantic; Air War and Antwerp itself during the war. The museum is unique in and around Antwerp thanks to its engine room that is almost entirely complete and in which machines are made functional again. As well parts of the V1 and V2 Weapons are free to visit, so you get a unique look at how these bombs worked.\n\n\n== History of the Bunker Village ==\nDuring World War II this bunker village was built as the main command for the Atlantic Wall in Belgium. The command ran from the French border to Walcheren. The troops which were in the bunkers and surrounding stationed was the LXXXIX. Army Corps led by General Werner Freiherr von und zu Gilsa and his staff. Not only von und zu Gilsa, but also General der Panzertruppen Alfred Ritter von Hubicki and even Generalfeldmarschall Rommel spent time visiting the Bunkers. Both Generals von Hubicki and von und zu Gilsa probably stayed in one of the houses around the park.\nThe bunkers were built in 1943 and after the landings in Normandy, on 29 August 1944, a few days before the liberation of Antwerp, the bunkers were abandoned by General von und zu Gilsa and his staff. After the war, in particular on 1 July 1947, all the furniture and equipment both inside and outside the bunkers were sold through auction. Afterwards, on 19 July 1947, plans were drawn up to demolish the bunkers but the plans were called off on March 20, 1948.\nBefore 1985 the command bunkers were still used by the Civil Protection, but moved afterwards.\nEventually the bunker village was recognized as Monument on June 11, 2004.\n\n\n== External links ==\nAtlantic Wall & Air War Bunker Museum Antwerp",

        "wiki": "Brussels (French: Bruxelles [b\u0281ys\u025bl] (listen) or [b\u0281yks\u025bl]; Dutch: Brussel [\u02c8br\u028fs\u0259l] (listen)), officially the Brussels-Capital Region (French: R\u00e9gion de Bruxelles-Capitale; Dutch: Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest), is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels, which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is located in the central portion of the country and is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the Flemish Region (within which it forms an enclave) and the Walloon Region. Brussels is the most densely populated and the richest region in Belgium in terms of GDP per capita. It covers 162 km2 (63 sq mi), a relatively small area compared to the two other regions, and has a population of over 1.2 million. The five times larger metropolitan area of Brussels comprises over 2.5 million people, which makes it the largest in Belgium. It is also part of a large conurbation extending towards Ghent, Antwerp, Leuven and Walloon Brabant, home to over 5 million people.Brussels grew from a small rural settlement on the river Senne to become an important city-region in Europe. Since the end of the Second World War, it has been a major centre for international politics and home to numerous international organisations, politicians, diplomats and civil servants. Brussels is the de facto capital of the European Union, as it hosts a number of principal EU institutions, including its administrative-legislative, executive-political, and legislative branches (though the judicial branch is located in Luxembourg, and the European Parliament meets for a minority of the year in Strasbourg). Its name is sometimes used metonymically to describe the EU and its institutions. The secretariat of the Benelux and headquarters of NATO are also located in Brussels. As the economic capital of Belgium and one of the top financial centres of Western Europe with Euronext Brussels, it is classified as an Alpha global city. Brussels is a hub for rail, road and air traffic, sometimes earning the moniker \"Crossroads of Europe\". The Brussels metro is the only rapid transit system in Belgium. In addition, both its airport and railway stations are the largest and busiest in the country.Historically Dutch-speaking, Brussels saw a language shift to French from the late 19th century. The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual in French and Dutch, even though French is now the lingua franca with over 90% of the inhabitants being able to speak it. Brussels is also increasingly becoming multilingual. English is spoken as a second language by nearly a third of the population and many migrants and expatriates speak other languages as well.Brussels is known for its cuisine and gastronomy, as well as its historical and architectural landmarks; some of them are registered as UNESCO World Heritage sites. Main attractions include its historic Grand Place, Manneken Pis, Atomium, and cultural institutions such as La Monnaie/De Munt and the Museums of Art and History. Due to its long tradition of Belgian comics, Brussels is also hailed as a capital of the comic strip.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe most common theory of the origin of the name Brussels is that it derives from the Old Dutch Bruocsella, Broekzele or Broeksel, meaning \"marsh\" (bruoc / broek) and \"home\" (sella / zele / sel) or \"home in the marsh\". Saint Vindicianus, the Bishop of Cambrai, made the first recorded reference to the place Brosella in 695, when it was still a hamlet. The names of all the municipalities in the Brussels-Capital Region are also of Dutch origin, except for Evere, which is Celtic.\n\n\n=== Pronunciation ===\nIn French, Bruxelles is pronounced [b\u0281ys\u025bl] (the x is pronounced , like in English, and the final s is silent) and in Dutch, Brussel is pronounced [\u02c8br\u028fs\u0259l]. Inhabitants of Brussels are known in French as Bruxellois and in Dutch as Brusselaars. In the Brabantian dialect of Brussels, they are called Brusseleers or Brusseleirs.\nOriginally, the written x noted the group . In the Belgian French pronunciation as well as in Dutch, the k eventually disappeared and z became s, as reflected in the current Dutch spelling, whereas in the more conservative French form, the spelling remained. The pronunciation  in French only dates from the 18th century, but this modification did not affect the traditional Brussels usage. In France, the pronunciations [b\u0281yks\u025bl] and [b\u0281yks\u025blwa] (for bruxellois) are often heard, but are rather rare in Belgium.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSee also: History of Brussels (in French)\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe history of Brussels is closely linked to that of Western Europe. Traces of human settlement go back to the Stone Age, with vestiges and place-names related to the civilisation of megaliths, dolmens and standing stones (Plattesteen in the City of Brussels and Tomberg in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, for example). During late antiquity, the region was home to Roman occupation, as attested by archaeological evidence discovered on the current site of Tour & Taxis. Following the decline of the Western Roman Empire, it was incorporated into the Frankish Empire.\nThe origin of the settlement which was to become Brussels lies in Saint Gaugericus' construction of a chapel on an island in the river Senne around 580. The official founding of Brussels is usually situated around 979, when Duke Charles of Lower Lotharingia transferred the relics of Saint Gudula from Moorsel (located in today's province of East Flanders) to Saint Gaugericus' chapel. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nLambert I of Leuven, Count of Leuven, gained the County of Brussels around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the Senne, on an important trade route between Bruges and Ghent, and Cologne, Brussels became a commercial centre specialised in the textile trade. The town grew quite rapidly and extended towards the upper town (Treurenberg, Coudenberg and Sablon/Zavel areas), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. Around this time, work began on what is now the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula (1225), replacing an older Romanesque church. In 1183, the Counts of Leuven became Dukes of Brabant. Brabant, unlike the county of Flanders, was not fief of the king of France but was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire. In the early 13th century, the first Fortifications of Brussels were built, and after this, the city grew significantly. To let the city expand, a second set of walls was erected between 1356 and 1383. Traces of these walls can still be seen, although the small ring, a series of roadways bounding the historic city centre, follows their former course.\n\n\n=== Early modern ===\n\nIn the 15th century, the marriage between heiress Margaret III of Flanders and Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, produced a new Duke of Brabant of the House of Valois (namely Antoine, their son). In 1477, the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold perished in the Battle of Nancy. Through the marriage of his daughter Mary of Burgundy (who was born in Brussels) to Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, the Low Countries fell under Habsburg sovereignty. Brabant was integrated into this composite state, and Brussels flourished as the Princely Capital of the prosperous Burgundian Netherlands, also known as the Seventeen Provinces. After the death of Mary in 1482, her son Philip the Handsome succeeded as Duke of Burgundy and Brabant.\nPhilip died in 1506, and he was succeeded by his son Charles V who then also became King of Spain (crowned in the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula) and even Holy Roman Emperor at the death of his grandfather Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1519. Charles was now the ruler of a Habsburg Empire \"on which the sun never sets\" with Brussels serving as his main capital. It was in the Palace complex at Coudenberg that Charles V was declared of age in 1515, and it was there that he abdicated all of his possessions and passed the Habsburg Netherlands to Philip II of Spain. This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire in 1731.\n\nIn the 17th century, Brussels was a centre for the lace industry. In 1695, during the Nine Years' War, King Louis XIV of France sent troops to bombard Brussels with artillery. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The Grand Place was destroyed, along with 4,000 buildings\u2014a third of all the buildings in the city. The reconstruction of the city centre, effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed its appearance and left numerous traces still visible today.\nFollowing the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Spanish sovereignty over the Southern Netherlands was transferred to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. This event started the era of the Austrian Netherlands. Brussels was captured by France in 1746, during the War of the Austrian Succession, but was handed back to Austria three years later. It remained with Austria until 1795, when the Southern Netherlands were captured and annexed by France, and the city became the capital of the department of the Dyle. The French rule ended in 1815, with the defeat of Napoleon on the battlefield of Waterloo, located south of today's Brussels-Capital Region. With the Congress of Vienna, the Southern Netherlands joined the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, under William I of Orange. The former Dyle department became the province of South Brabant, with Brussels as its capital.\n\n\n=== Late modern ===\n\nIn 1830, the Belgian revolution began in Brussels, after a performance of Auber's opera La Muette de Portici at the Royal Theatre of La Monnaie. The city became the capital and seat of government of the new nation. South Brabant was renamed simply Brabant, with Brussels as its administrative centre. On 21 July 1831, Leopold I, the first King of the Belgians, ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings.\nFollowing independence, Brussels underwent many more changes. It became a financial centre, thanks to the dozens of companies launched by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique. The Industrial Revolution and the building of the Brussels-Charleroi Canal brought prosperity to the city through commerce and manufacturing. The Free University of Brussels was established in 1834 and Saint-Louis University in 1858. In 1835, the first passenger railway built outside England linked the municipality of Molenbeek with Mechelen.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the population of Brussels grew considerably; from about 80,000 to more than 625,000 people for the city and its surroundings. The Senne had become a serious health hazard, and from 1867 to 1871, under the tenure of the city's then-mayor, Jules Anspach, its entire course through the urban area was completely covered over. This allowed urban renewal and the construction of modern buildings of hausmannien style along central boulevards, characteristic of downtown Brussels today. Buildings such as the Brussels Stock Exchange (1873), the Palace of Justice (1883) and Saint Mary's Royal Church (1885) date from this period. This development continued throughout the reign of King Leopold II. The International Exposition of 1897 contributed to the promotion of the infrastructure. Among other things, the Colonial Palace (today's Royal Museum for Central Africa), in the suburb of Tervuren, was connected to the capital by the construction of an 11-km long grand alley.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nDuring the 20th century, the city hosted various fairs and conferences, including the Solvay Conference on Physics and on Chemistry, and three world fairs: the Brussels International Exposition of 1910, the Brussels International Exposition of 1935 and the 1958 Brussels World\u2019s Fair (Expo '58). During World War I, Brussels was an occupied city, but German troops did not cause much damage. During World War II, it was again occupied by German forces, and spared major damage, before it was liberated by the British Guards Armoured Division on 3 September 1944. The Brussels Airport, in the suburb of Zaventem, dates from the occupation.\n\nAfter the war, Brussels underwent extensive modernisation. The construction of the North\u2013South connection, linking the main railway stations in the city, was completed in 1952, while the first premetro (underground tram) was finished in 1969, and the first line of the metro was opened in 1976. Starting from the early 1960s, Brussels became the de facto capital of what would become the European Union, and many modern offices were built. Development was allowed to proceed with little regard to the aesthetics of newer buildings, and numerous architectural landmarks were demolished to make way for newer buildings that often clashed with their surroundings, giving name to the process of Brusselisation.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nThe Brussels-Capital Region was formed on 18 June 1989, after a constitutional reform in 1988. It is one of the three federal regions of Belgium, along with Flanders and Wallonia, and has bilingual status. The yellow iris is the emblem of the region (referring to the presence of these flowers on the city's original site) and a stylised version is featured on its official flag.In recent years, Brussels has become an important venue for international events. In 2000, it and eight other European cities were named European Capital of Culture. In 2014, the city hosted the 40th G7 summit.On 22 March 2016, three coordinated nail bombings were detonated by ISIL in Brussels\u2014two at Brussels Airport in Zaventem and one at Maalbeek/Maelbeek metro station\u2014resulting in 32 victims and three suicide bombers killed, and 330 people were injured. It was the deadliest act of terrorism in Belgium.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location and topography ===\n\nBrussels lies in the north-central part of Belgium, about 110 kilometres (68 miles) from the Belgian coast and about 180 km (110 mi) from Belgium's southern tip. It is located in the heartland of the Brabantian Plateau, about 45 km (28 mi) south of Antwerp (Flanders), and 50 km (31 mi) north of Charleroi (Wallonia). Its average elevation is 57 metres (187 feet) above sea level, varying from a low point in the valley of the almost completely covered Senne, which cuts the region from east to west, up to high points in the Sonian Forest, on its southeastern side. In addition to the Senne, tributary streams such as the Maalbeek and the Woluwe, to the east of the region, account for significant elevation differences. Brussels' central boulevards are 15 metres (49 feet) above sea level. The highest point lies at a height of about 108 metres (354 feet), near the Place de l'Altitude Cent/Hoogte Honderdplein, in Forest.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBrussels experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) with warm summers and cool winters. Proximity to coastal areas influences the area's climate by sending marine air masses from the Atlantic Ocean. Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements over the last 100 years), there are approximately 200 days of rain per year in the Brussels-Capital Region, one of the highest totals for any European capital. Snowfall is infrequent, averaging 24 days per year. The city also often experiences violent thunderstorms in summer months.\n\n\n== Brussels as a capital ==\nDespite its name, the Brussels-Capital Region is not the capital of Belgium. Article 194 of the Belgian Constitution establishes that the capital of Belgium is the City of Brussels, the municipality in the region that is the city's core.The City of Brussels is the location of many national institutions. The Royal Palace, where the King of the Belgians exercises his prerogatives as head of state, is situated alongside Brussels' Park (not to be confused with the Royal Castle of Laeken, the official home of the Belgian Royal Family). The Palace of the Nation is located on the opposite side of this park, and is the seat of the Belgian Federal Parliament. The office of the Prime Minister of Belgium, colloquially called Law Street 16 (French: 16, rue de la Loi, Dutch: Wetstraat 16), is located adjacent to this building. It is also where the Council of Ministers holds its meetings. The Court of Cassation, Belgium's main court, has its seat in the Palace of Justice. Other important institutions in the City of Brussels are the Constitutional Court, the Council of State, the Court of Audit, the Royal Belgian Mint and the National Bank of Belgium.\nThe City of Brussels is also the capital of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community. The Flemish Parliament and Flemish Government have their seats in Brussels, and so do the Parliament of the French Community and the Government of the French Community.\n\n\n== Municipalities ==\n\nThe 19 municipalities (French: communes, Dutch: gemeenten) of the Brussels-Capital Region are political subdivisions with individual responsibilities for the handling of local level duties, such as law enforcement and the upkeep of schools and roads within its borders. Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.In 1831, Belgium was divided into 2,739 municipalities, including the 19 in the Brussels-Capital Region. Unlike most of the municipalities in Belgium, the ones located in the Brussels-Capital Region were not merged with others during mergers occurring in 1964, 1970, and 1975. However, several municipalities outside the Brussels-Capital Region have been merged with the City of Brussels throughout its history, including Laeken, Haren and Neder-Over-Heembeek in 1921.The largest municipality in area and population is the City of Brussels, covering 32.6 square kilometres (12.6 sq mi) and with 145,917 inhabitants; the least populous is Koekelberg with 18,541 inhabitants. The smallest in area is Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, which is only 1.1 square kilometres (0.4 sq mi), but still has the highest population density in the region, with 20,822 inhabitants per square kilometre (53,930/sq mi). Watermael-Boitsfort has the lowest population density in the region, with 1,928 inhabitants per square kilometre (4,990/sq mi).\nThere is much controversy on the division of 19 municipalities for a highly urbanised region, which is considered as (half of) one city by most people. Some politicians mock the \"19 baronies\" and want to merge the municipalities under one city council and one mayor. That would lower the number of politicians needed to govern Brussels, and centralise the power over the city to make decisions easier, thus reduce the overall running costs. The current municipalities could be transformed into districts with limited responsibilities, similar to the current structure of Antwerp or to structures of other capitals like the boroughs in London or arrondissements in Paris, to keep politics close enough to the citizen.In early 2016, Molenbeek-Saint-Jean held a reputation as a safe haven for jihadists in relation to the support shown by some residents towards the bombers who carried out the Paris and Brussels attacks.\n\nMunicipalities of Brussels\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Brussels-Capital Region ==\n\n\n=== Political status ===\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three federated regions of Belgium, alongside the Walloon Region and the Flemish Region. Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual enclave in the monolingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions; the three communities being the other component. Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the French Community or the Flemish Community for matters such as culture and education, as well as a Common Community for competencies which do not belong exclusively to either Community, such as healthcare and social welfare.\nSince the split of Brabant in 1995, the Brussels Region does not belong to any of the provinces of Belgium, nor is it subdivided into provinces itself. Within the Region, 99% of the areas of provincial jurisdiction are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions and community commissions. Remaining is only the governor of Brussels-Capital and some aides, analogously to provinces. Its status is roughly akin to that of a federal district.\n\n\n=== Institutions ===\n\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is governed by a parliament of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking\u2014parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a minister-president, four ministers and three state secretaries. By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state. The minister-president does not count against the language quota, but in practice every minister-president has been a bilingual francophone. The regional parliament can enact ordinances (French: ordonnances, Dutch: ordonnanties), which have equal status as a national legislative act.\n19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the Parliament of the French Community of Belgium, and, until 2004, this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the Flemish Parliament. Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.\n\n\n=== Agglomeration of Brussels ===\nBefore the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, regional competences in the 19 municipalities were performed by the Brussels Agglomeration. The Brussels Agglomeration was an administrative division established in 1971. This decentralised administrative public body also assumed jurisdiction over areas which, elsewhere in Belgium, were exercised by municipalities or provinces.The Brussels Agglomeration had a separate legislative council, but the by-laws enacted by it did not have the status of a legislative act. The only election of the council took place on 21 November 1971. The working of the council was subject to many difficulties caused by the linguistic and socio-economic tensions between the two communities.\nAfter the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, the Brussels Agglomeration was never formally abolished, although it no longer has a purpose.\n\n\n== French and Flemish communities ==\n\nThe French Community and the Flemish Community exercise their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the French Community Commission (French: Commission communautaire fran\u00e7aise or COCOF) and the Flemish Community Commission (Dutch: Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie or VGC). These two bodies each have an assembly composed of the members of each linguistic group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.\nThe French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative powers of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area). The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community. This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact decrees, which are legislative acts.\n\n\n=== Common Community Commission ===\nA bi-communitarian public authority, the Common Community Commission (French: Commission communautaire commune, COCOM, Dutch: Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, GGC) also exists. Its assembly is composed of the members of the regional parliament, and its board are the ministers\u2014not the secretaries of state\u2014of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote. This commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact by-laws. In another capacity, it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel). The Common Community Commission is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centres for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.\n\n\n== International institutions ==\nBrussels has, since World War II, become the administrative centre of many international organisations. The European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have their main institutions in the city, along with many other international organisations such as the World Customs Organization and EUROCONTROL, as well as international corporations. Brussels is third in the number of international conferences it hosts, also becoming one of the largest convention centres in the world. The presence of the EU and the other international bodies has, for example, led to there being more ambassadors and journalists in Brussels than in Washington D.C. International schools have also been established to serve this presence. The \"international community\" in Brussels numbers at least 70,000 people. In 2009, there were an estimated 286 lobbying consultancies known to work in Brussels.\n\n\n=== European Union ===\n\nBrussels serves as de facto capital of the European Union, hosting the major political institutions of the Union. The EU has not declared a capital formally, though the Treaty of Amsterdam formally gives Brussels the seat of the European Commission (the executive branch of government) and the Council of the European Union (a legislative institution made up from executives of member states). It locates the formal seat of European Parliament in Strasbourg, where votes take place, with the council, on the proposals made by the commission. However, meetings of political groups and committee groups are formally given to Brussels, along with a set number of plenary sessions. Three quarters of Parliament sessions now take place at its Brussels hemicycle. Between 2002 and 2004, the European Council also fixed its seat in the city. In 2014, the Union hosted a G7 summit in the city.\n\nBrussels, along with Luxembourg and Strasbourg, began to host European institutions in 1957, soon becoming the centre of activities, as the Commission and Council based their activities in what has become the European Quarter, in the east of the city. Early building in Brussels was sporadic and uncontrolled, with little planning. The current major buildings are the Berlaymont building of the commission, symbolic of the quarter as a whole, the Justus Lipsius building of the Council and the Espace L\u00e9opold of the Parliament. Today, the presence has increased considerably, with the Commission alone occupying 865,000 m2 (9,310,000 sq ft) within the European Quarter (a quarter of the total office space in Brussels). The concentration and density has caused concern that the presence of the institutions has created a ghetto effect in that part of the city. However, the European presence has contributed significantly to the importance of Brussels as an international centre.\n\n\n=== Eurocontrol ===\n\nThe European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, commonly known as Eurocontrol, is an international organisation which coordinates and plans air traffic control across European airspace. The corporation was founded in 1960 and currently has 41 member states. Its headquarters are located in Haren, on the northeast perimeter of the City of Brussels.\n\n\n=== North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ===\n\nThe Treaty of Brussels, which was signed on 17 March 1948 between Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, was a prelude to the establishment of the intergovernmental military alliance which later became the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Today, the alliance consists of 29 independent member countries across North America and Europe. Several countries also have diplomatic missions to NATO through embassies in Belgium. Since 1949, a number of NATO Summits have been held in Brussels, the most recent taking place in May 2017. The organisation's political and administrative headquarters are located on Boulevard L\u00e9opold III/Leopold III-laan in Haren, Brussels. A new \u20ac750 million headquarters building begun in 2010 and was completed in 2017.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nBrussels is located in one of the most urbanised regions of Europe, between Paris, London, the Rhine-Ruhr (Germany), and the Randstad (Netherlands). The Brussels-Capital Region has a population of around 1.2 million and has witnessed, in recent years, a remarkable increase in its population. In general, the population of Brussels is younger than the national average, and the gap between rich and poor is wider.Brussels and its suburbs, taking into account its outer commuter zone (Brussels Regional Express Network (RER/GEN) area), have a population of about 2.6 million and extend over a large part of the two Brabant provinces. Brussels is also part of a wider diamond-shaped conurbation, with Ghent, Antwerp and Leuven, which has about 4.4 million inhabitants (a little more than 40% of the Belgium's total population).\n\n\n=== Nationalities ===\nBrussels is home to a large number of immigrants. At the last Belgian census in 1991, 63.7% of inhabitants in Brussels-Capital Region answered that they were Belgian citizens, born as such in Belgium. However, there have been numerous individual or familial migrations towards Brussels since the end of the 18th century, including political refugees (Karl Marx, Victor Hugo, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, L\u00e9on Daudet, for example), from neighbouring or more distant countries, as well as labour migrants, former foreign students or expatriates, and many Belgian families in Brussels can claim at least one foreign grandparent.\nBrussels has a large concentration of immigrants from other countries, and their children, including many of Moroccan (Riffian, Berber) and Turkish ancestry, together with French-speaking black Africans from former Belgian colonies, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi.\nPeople of foreign origin make up nearly 70% of the population of Brussels, most of whom have been naturalised following the great 1991 reform of the naturalisation process. About 32% of city residents are of non-Belgian European origin, and 36% are of another background, mostly from Morocco, Turkey and Sub-Saharan Africa. Among all major migrant groups from outside the EU, a majority of the permanent residents have acquired Belgian nationality.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nSince the founding of the Kingdom of Belgium in 1830, Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely Dutch-speaking (Brabantian dialect to be exact), to being a multilingual city with French (specifically Belgian French) as the majority language and lingua franca. This language shift, the Francisation of Brussels, is rooted in the 18th century and accelerated after Belgium became independent and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries.French-speaking immigration contributed to the Frenchification of Brussels; both Walloons and expatriates from other countries\u2014mainly France\u2014came to Brussels in great numbers. However, a more important cause for the Frenchification was the language change over several generations from Dutch to French that was carried out by Flemish inhabitants themselves. The main reason for this was a political, administrative and social pressure, partly based on the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time; this made French the only language of administration, law, politics and education in Belgium, and thus necessary for social mobility. From 1880 on, faced with the necessity of using French in dealing with such institutions, more and more Dutch-speakers in Brussels became bilingual, and a rise in the number of monolingual French-speakers was seen after 1910. Halfway through the 20th century, the number of monolingual French-speakers surpassed the number of mostly bilingual Flemish inhabitants.Only since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian language border, and after the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use. Through immigration, a further number of formerly Dutch-speaking municipalities surrounding Brussels became majoritively French-speaking in the second half of the 20th century. This phenomenon is, together with the future of Brussels, one of the most controversial topics in all of Belgian politics.\n\nGiven its Dutch-speaking origins and the role that the City of Brussels plays as capital in a bilingual country, the administration of the entire Brussels-Capital Region is fully bilingual, including its subdivisions and public services. Nevertheless, some communitarian issues remain. Flemish political parties demanded, for decades, that the Flemish part of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde arrondissement be separated from the Brussels Region (which made Halle-Vilvoorde a monolingual Flemish arrondissement). BHV was divided mid-2012. The French-speaking population regards the language border as artificial and demands the extension of the bilingual region to at least all six municipalities with language facilities in the surroundings of Brussels. Flemish politicians have strongly rejected these proposals.\n\nThe original Dutch dialect of Brussels (Brussels) is a form of Brabantic (the variant of Dutch spoken in the ancient Duchy of Brabant) with a significant number of loanwords from French, and still survives among a minority of inhabitants called Brusseleers, many of them quite bi- and multilingual, or educated in French and not writing in Dutch. Brussels and its suburbs have evolved from a Dutch-dialect-speaking town to a mainly French-speaking town. The ethnic and national self-identification of the inhabitants is quite different along ethnic lines.\nFor their French-speaking Bruxellois, it can vary from Belgian, Francophone Belgian, Bruxellois (like the Memellanders in interwar ethnic censuses in Memel), Walloon (for people who migrated from the Walloon Region at an adult age); for Flemings living in Brussels, it is mainly either Flemish or Brusselaar (Dutch for an inhabitant), and often both. For the Brusseleers, many simply consider themselves as belonging to Brussels. For the many rather recent immigrants from other countries, the identification also includes all the national origins: people tend to call themselves Moroccans or Turks rather than an American-style hyphenated version.\nThe two largest foreign groups come from two francophone countries: France and Morocco. The first language of roughly half of the inhabitants is not an official one of the Capital Region. Nevertheless, about three out of four residents are Belgian nationals.In recent decades, owing to migration and the city's international role, Brussels is home to a growing number of foreign language speakers. In 2013, figures cited in the Marnix Plan show that 63.2% of Brussels inhabitants are native speakers of French, while less than 20% are native Dutch speakers. Just 2.5% speak English as their mother tongue, but 29.7% of people living in the city claim to speak English well or very well. Even though some people want English to be used as an unofficial compromise language between Dutch and French, French remains the lingua franca, and laws still require Dutch and French translations in most cases. The acceptance of English as a language for communication with the city's public servants depends entirely on their knowledge of this language, though they must accept questions in French and Dutch.The migrant communities, as well as rapidly growing communities of EU-nationals from other member states, speak many languages like French, Turkish, Arabic, Berber, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, German, Greek, Romanian, Bulgarian, and (increasingly) English. The degree of linguistic integration varies widely within each migrant group.\n\n\n=== Religions ===\n\nHistorically, Brussels has been predominantly Roman Catholic, especially since the expulsion of Protestants in the 16th century. This is clear from the large number of historical churches in the region, particularly in the City of Brussels. The pre-eminent Catholic cathedral in Brussels is the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula, serving as the co-cathedral of the Archdiocese of Mechelen\u2013Brussels. On the northwestern side of the region, the National Basilica of the Sacred Heart is a Minor Basilica and parish church and the 14th largest church building in the world. The Church of Our Lady of Laeken holds the tombs of many members of the Belgian royal family, including all the former Belgian monarchs, within the Royal Crypt.\n\nIn reflection of its multicultural makeup, Brussels hosts a variety of religious communities, as well as large numbers of atheists and agnostics. Minority faiths include Islam, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Judaism, and Buddhism. According to a 2016 survey, approximately 40% of residents of Brussels declared themselves Catholics (12% were practising Catholics and 28% were non-practising Catholics), 30% were non-religious, 23% were Muslim (19% practising, 4% non-practising), 3% were Protestants and 4% were of another religion.Recognised religions and laicism enjoy public funding and school courses. It was once the case that every pupil in an official school from 6 years old to 18 had to choose 2 hours per week of compulsory religion\u2014or laicist\u2014inspired morals. However, in 2015, the Belgian Constitutional court ruled religious studies could no longer be required in the primary and secondary education system.\n\nBrussels has a large concentration of Muslims, mostly of Moroccan, Turkish, Syrian and Guinean ancestry. The Great Mosque of Brussels, located in the Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark, is the oldest mosque in Brussels. Belgium does not collect statistics by ethnic background, so exact figures are unknown. It was estimated that, in 2005, people of Muslim background living in the Brussels Region numbered 256,220 and accounted for 25.5% of the city's population, a much higher concentration than those of the other regions of Belgium.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe architecture in Brussels is diverse, and spans from the clashing combination of Gothic, Baroque, and Louis XIV styles on the Grand Place to the postmodern buildings of the EU institutions.\n\nVery little medieval architecture is preserved in Brussels. Buildings from that period are mostly found in the historic centre (called \u00celot Sacr\u00e9), Saint G\u00e9ry/Sint-Goriks and Sainte-Catherine/Sint Katelijne neighbourhoods. The Brabantine Gothic Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula remains a prominent feature in the skyline of downtown Brussels. Isolated portions of the first city walls were saved from destruction and can be seen to this day. One of the only remains of the second walls is the Halle Gate. The Grand Place is the main attraction in the city centre and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1998. The square is dominated by the 15th century Flamboyant Town Hall, the neo-Gothic Breadhouse and the Baroque guildhalls of the Guilds of Brussels. Manneken Pis, a fountain containing a small bronze sculpture of a urinating youth, is a tourist attraction and symbol of the city.\n\nThe neoclassical style of the 18th and 19th centuries is represented in the Royal Quarter/Coudenberg area, around Brussels' Park and the Royal Square. Examples include the Royal Palace, the Church of Saint-Jacques on the Coudenberg, the Palace of the Nation (Parliament building), the Academy Palace, the Palace of Charles of Lorraine, the Palace of the Count of Flanders and the Egmont Palace. Other uniform neoclassical ensembles can be found around Martyrs' Square and Barricades' Square. Some additional landmarks in the centre are the Royal Saint-Hubert Galleries (1847), one of the oldest covered shopping arcades in Europe, the Congress Column (1859), the former Brussels Stock Exchange building (1873) and the Palace of Justice (1883), designed by Joseph Poelaert, in eclectic style, and reputed to be the largest building constructed in the 19th century.Located outside the centre, in a greener environment, are the Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark with its triumphal arch and nearby museums, and in Laeken, the Royal Castle of Laeken and the Royal Domain with its large greenhouses, as well as the Museums of the Far East.\nAlso particularly striking are the buildings in the Art Nouveau style, most famously by the Belgian architects Victor Horta, Paul Hankar and Henry Van de Velde. Some of Brussels' municipalities, such as Schaerbeek, Etterbeek, Ixelles, and Saint-Gilles, were developed during the heyday of Art Nouveau and have many buildings in that style. The Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta\u2014H\u00f4tel Tassel (1893), H\u00f4tel Solvay (1894), H\u00f4tel van Eetvelde (1895) and the Horta Museum (1901)\u2014have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000. Another example of Brussels' Art Nouveau is the Stoclet Palace (1911), by the Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann, designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in June 2009.\nArt Nouveau in Brussels\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nArt Deco structures in Brussels include the Residence Palace (1927) (now part of the Europa building), the Centre for Fine Arts (1928), the Villa Empain (1934), the Town Hall of Forest (1938), and the Flagey Building on Flagey Square (1935\u20131938) in Ixelles. Some religious buildings from the interwar era were also constructed in that style, such as the Church of St. John the Baptist (1932) in Molenbeek and the Church of St. Augustine (1935) in Forest. Completed only in 1969, and combining Art Deco with neo-Byzantine elements, the Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Koekelberg is one of the largest Roman Catholic basilicas by area in the world, and its cupola provides a panoramic view of Brussels and its outskirts. Another example are the exhibition halls of the Centenary Palace, built for the 1935 World's Fair on the Heysel/Heizel Plateau in northern Brussels, and currently home to the Brussels Exhibition Centre (Brussels Expo).\n\nThe Atomium is a symbolic 103-metre-tall (338 ft) modernist structure, located on the Heysel Plateau, which was originally built for the 1958 World's Fair (Expo '58). It consists of nine steel spheres connected by tubes, and forms a model of an iron crystal (specifically, a unit cell), magnified 165 billion times. The architect A. Waterkeyn devoted the building to science. It is now considered a landmark of Brussels. Next to the Atomium, is Mini-Europe miniature park, with 1:25 scale maquettes of famous buildings from across Europe.\n\nSince the second half of the 20th century, modern office towers have been built in Brussels (Madou Tower, Rogier Tower, Proximus Towers, Finance Tower, the World Trade Center, among others). There are some thirty towers, mostly concentrated in the city's main business district: the Northern Quarter (also called Little Manhattan), near Brussels-North railway station. The South Tower, standing adjacent to Brussels-South railway station, is the tallest building in Belgium, at 148 m (486 ft). Along the North\u2013South connection, is the State Administrative City, an administrative complex in the International Style. The postmodern buildings of the Espace L\u00e9opold complete the picture.\nThe city's embrace of modern architecture translated into an ambivalent approach towards historic preservation, leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks, most famously the Maison du Peuple/Volkshuis by Victor Horta, a process known as Brusselisation.\n\n\n=== Arts ===\n\nBrussels contains over 80 museums. The Royal Museums of Fine Arts has an extensive collection of various painters, such as Flemish old masters like Bruegel, Rogier van der Weyden, Robert Campin, Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, and Peter Paul Rubens. The Magritte Museum houses the world's largest collection of the works of the surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte. Museums dedicated to the national history of Belgium include the BELvue Museum, the Royal Museums of Art and History, and the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History. The Musical Instruments Museum (MIM), housed in the Old England building, is part of the Royal Museums of Art and History, and is internationally renowned for its collection of over 8,000 instruments.\nThe Brussels Museums Council is an independent body for all the museums in the Brussels-Capital Region, covering around 100 federal, private, municipal, and community museums. It promotes member museums through the Brussels Card (giving access to public transport and 30 of the 100 museums), the Brussels Museums Nocturnes (every Thursday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. from mid-September to mid-December) and the Museum Night Fever (an event for and by young people on a Saturday night in late February or early March).\n\nBrussels has had a distinguished artist scene for many years. The famous Belgian surrealists Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Paul Delvaux, for instance, studied and lived there, as did the avant-garde dramatist Michel de Ghelderode. The city was also home of the impressionist painter Anna Boch from the Artist Group Les XX, and includes other famous Belgian painters such as L\u00e9on Spilliaert. Brussels is also a capital of the comic strip; some treasured Belgian characters are Tintin, Lucky Luke, The Smurfs, Spirou, Gaston, Marsupilami, Blake and Mortimer, Boule et Bill and Cubitus (see Belgian comics). Throughout the city, walls are painted with large motifs of comic book characters; these murals taken together are known as Brussels' Comic Book Route. Also, the interiors of some metro stations are designed by artists. The Belgian Comic Strip Center combines two artistic leitmotifs of Brussels, being a museum devoted to Belgian comic strips, housed in the former Magasins Waucquez textile department store, designed by Victor Horta in the Art Nouveau style.\nBrussels is well known for its performing arts scene, with the Royal Theatre of La Monnaie and the Kaaitheater among the most notable institutions. The Kunstenfestivaldesarts, an international performing arts festival, is organised every year in May in about twenty different cultural houses and theatres throughout the city. The King Baudouin Stadium is a concert and competition facility with a 50,000 seat capacity, the largest in Belgium. The site was formerly occupied by the Heysel Stadium. Furthermore, the Center for Fine Arts (often referred to as BOZAR in French or PSK in Dutch), a multi-purpose centre for theatre, cinema, music, literature and art exhibitions, is home to the National Orchestra of Belgium and to the annual Queen Elisabeth Competition for classical singers and instrumentalists, one of the most challenging and prestigious competitions of the kind. Studio 4 in Le Flagey cultural centre hosts the Brussels Philharmonic. Other concert venues include Forest National/Vorst Nationaal, the Ancienne Belgique, the Cirque Royal/Koninklijk Circus, the Botanique and the Palais 12/Paleis 12. The Jazz Station in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode is a museum and archive on jazz, and a venue for jazz concerts.\n\n\n=== Folklore ===\n\nBrussels' identity owes much to its rich folklore and traditions, among the liveliest in the country.\n\nThe Ommegang, a folkloric costumed procession, commemorating the Joyous Entry of Emperor Charles V in the city in 1549, takes place every year in July. The colourful parade includes floats, traditional giant puppets, such as Saint Michael and Saint Gudula, and scores of folkloric groups, either on foot or on horseback, dressed in medieval garb. The parade ends in a pageant on the Grand Place.\nThe Meyboom, an even older folk tradition of Brussels (1308), celebrating the May tree\u2014in fact, a bad translation of the Dutch tree of joy\u2014takes place paradoxically on 9 August. After parading a young beech in the city, it is planted in a joyful spirit involving lots of music, Brusseleir songs, and giant puppets. It was recognised as an expression of intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO, as part of the bi-national inscription \"Processional giants and dragons in Belgium and France\". The celebration is reminiscent of the town's long-standing (folkloric) feud with Leuven, which dates back to the Middle Ages.\nAnother good introduction to the Brusseleir local dialect and way of life can be obtained at the Royal Theatre of Toone, a folkloric theatre of marionettes, located a stone throw away from the Grand Place.\nThe Saint-Verhaegen (often shortened to St V), a folkloric student procession, celebrating the anniversary of the founding of the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, is held on 20 November.\n\n\n=== Cultural events and festivals ===\n\nMany events are organised or hosted in Brussels throughout the year. In addition, many festivals animate the Brussels scene.\nThe Iris Festival is the official festival of the Brussels-Capital Region and is held annually in spring. The International Fantastic Film Festival of Brussels (BIFFF) is organised during the Easter holidays and the Magritte Awards in February. The Festival of Europe, an open day and activities in and around the institutions of the European Union, is held on 9 May. On Belgian National Day, on 21 July, a military parade and celebrations take place on the Place des Palais/Paleizenplein and in Brussels' Park, ending with a display of fireworks in the evening.\n\nSome summer festivities include Couleur Caf\u00e9 Festival, a festival of world and urban music, around the end of June or early July, the Brussels Summer Festival (BSF), a music festival in August, the Brussels Fair, the most important yearly fair in Brussels, lasting more than a month, in July and August, and Brussels Beach, when the banks of the canal are turned into a temporary urban beach. Other biennial events are the Zinneke Parade, a colourful, multicultural parade through the city, which has been held since 2000 in May, as well as the popular Flower Carpet at the Grand Place in August. Heritage Days are organised on the third weekend of September (sometimes coinciding with the car-free day) and are a good opportunity to discover the wealth of buildings, institutions and real estate in Brussels. The \"Winter Wonders\" animate the heart of Brussels in December; these winter activities were launched in Brussels in 2001.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nBrussels is known for its local waffle, its chocolate, its French fries and its numerous types of beers. The Brussels sprout, which has long been popular in Brussels, and may have originated there, is also named after the city.The gastronomic offer includes approximately 1,800 restaurants, and a number of high quality bars. Belgian cuisine is known among connoisseurs as one of the best in Europe. In addition to the traditional restaurants, there are many caf\u00e9s, bistros and the usual range of international fast food chains. The caf\u00e9s are similar to bars, and offer beer and light dishes; coffee houses are called salons de th\u00e9. Also widespread are brasseries, which usually offer a variety of beers and typical national dishes.\nBelgian cuisine is characterised by the combination of French cuisine with the more hearty Flemish fare. Notable specialities include Brussels waffles (gaufres) and mussels (usually as moules-frites, served with fries). The city is a stronghold of chocolate and pralines manufacturers with renowned companies like C\u00f4te d'Or, Neuhaus, Leonidas and Godiva. Pralines were first introduced in 1912, by Jean Neuhaus II, a Belgian chocolatier of Swiss origin, in the Royal Saint-Hubert Galleries. Numerous friteries are spread throughout the city, and in tourist areas, fresh hot waffles are also sold on the street.\nAs well as other Belgian beers, the spontaneously fermented lambic style, brewed in and around Brussels, is widely available there and in the nearby Senne valley where the wild yeasts which ferment it have their origin. Kriek, a cherry lambic, is available in almost every bar or restaurant in Brussels.\nBrussels is known as the birthplace of the Belgian Endive. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\nFamous shopping areas in Brussels include the pedestrian-only Rue Neuve/Nieuwstraat, the second busiest shopping street in Belgium (after the Meir, in Antwerp) with a weekly average of 230,000 visitors, home to popular international chains (H&M, C&A, Zara, Primark), as well as the City 2 and Anspach galleries. The Royal Saint-Hubert Galleries hold a variety of luxury shops and some six million people stroll through them each year. The neighbourhood around Rue Antoine Dansaert/Antoine Dansaertstraat has become, in recent years, a focal point for fashion and design; this main street and its side streets also feature Belgium's young and most happening artistic talent.In Ixelles, Avenue de la Toison d'Or/Gulden-Vlieslaan and Namur Gate area offer a blend of luxury shops, fast food restaurants and entertainment venues, and Chauss\u00e9e d'Ixelles/Elsenesteenweg, in the mainly-Congolese Matong\u00e9 district, offers a great taste of African fashion and lifestyle. The nearby Avenue Louise is lined with high-end fashion stores and boutiques, making it one of the most expensive streets in Belgium.There are shopping centres outside the inner ring: Basilix, Woluwe Shopping Center, Westland Shopping Center, and Docks Bruxsel, which opened in October 2017. In addition, Brussels ranks as one of Europe's best capital cities for flea market shopping. The Old Market, on the Place du Jeu de Balle/Vossenplein, in the Marolles/Marollen neighbourhood, is particularly renowned. The nearby Sablon/Zavel area is home to many of Brussels' antique dealers. The Midi Market around Brussels-South station and Boulevard du Midi/Zuidlaan is reputed to be one of the largest markets in Europe.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nSport in Brussels is under the responsibility of the Communities. The Administration de l'\u00c9ducation Physique et du Sport (ADEPS) is responsible for recognising the various French-speaking sports federations and also runs three sports centres in the Brussels-Capital Region. Its Dutch-speaking counterpart is Sport Vlaanderen (formerly called BLOSO).The King Baudouin Stadium (formerly Heysel Stadium) is the largest in the country and home to the national teams in football and rugby union. It hosted the final of the 1972 UEFA European Football Championship, and the opening game of the 2000 edition. Several European club finals have been held at the ground, including the 1985 European Cup Final which saw 39 deaths due to hooliganism and structural collapse. The King Baudouin Stadium is also home of the annual Memorial Van Damme athletics event, Belgium's foremost track and field competition, which is part of the Diamond League. Other important athletics events are the Brussels Marathon and the 20 km of Brussels.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nBrussels is home to notable cycling races. The city is the arrival location of the Brussels Cycling Classic, formerly known as Paris\u2013Brussels, which is one of the oldest semi classic bicycle races on the international calendar. From World War I until the early 1970s, the Six Days of Brussels was organised regularly. In the last decades of the 20th century, the Grand Prix Eddy Merckx was also held in Brussels.\n\n\n=== Association football ===\n\nR.S.C. Anderlecht, based in the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium in Anderlecht, is the most successful Belgian football club in the Belgian Pro League, with 34 titles. It has also won the most major European tournaments for a Belgian side, with 6 European titles.\nBrussels is also home to Union Saint-Gilloise, the most successful Belgian club before World War II, with 11 titles The club was founded in Saint-Gilles but is based in nearby Forest, and currently plays in Second Division. White Star Bruxelles is another football club that plays in second division. Racing White Daring Molenbeek, based in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, and often referred to as RWDM, was a very popular football club until it was dissolved in 2002. Since 2015, its reincarnation RWDM47 is back playing in the second division.\nOther Brussels clubs that played in the national series over the years were Ixelles SC, Crossing Club de Schaerbeek (born from a merger between RCS de Schaerbeek and Crossing Club Molenbeek), Scup Jette, RUS de Laeken, Racing Jet de Bruxelles, AS Auderghem, KV Wosjot Woluwe and FC Ganshoren.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nServing as the centre of administration for Belgium and Europe, Brussels' economy is largely service-oriented. It is dominated by regional and world headquarters of multinationals, by European institutions, by various local and federal administrations, and by related services companies, though it does have a number of notable craft industries, such as the Cantillon Brewery, a lambic brewery founded in 1900.\n\nBrussels has a robust economy. The region contributes to one fifth of Belgium's GDP, and its 550,000 jobs account for 17.7% of Belgium's employment. Its GDP per capita is nearly double that of Belgium as a whole, and it has the highest GDP per capita of any NUTS 1 region in the EU, at ~$80,000 in 2016. That being said, the GDP is boosted by a massive inflow of commuters from neighbouring regions; over half of those who work in Brussels live in Flanders or Wallonia, with 230,000 and 130,000 commuters per day respectively. Conversely, only 16.0% of people from Brussels work outside Brussels (68,827 (68.5%) of them in Flanders and 21,035 (31.5%) in Wallonia). Not all of the wealth generated in Brussels remains in Brussels itself, and as of December 2013, the unemployment among residents of Brussels is 20.4%.\n\nThere are approximately 50,000 businesses in Brussels, of which around 2,200 are foreign. This number is constantly increasing and can well explain the role of Brussels in Europe. The city's infrastructure is very favourable in terms of starting up a new business. House prices have also increased in recent years, especially with the increase of young professionals settling down in Brussels, making it the most expensive city to live in Belgium. In addition, Brussels holds more than 1,000 business conferences annually, making it the ninth most popular conference city in Europe.Brussels is rated as the 34th most important financial centre in the world as of 2020, according to the Global Financial Centres Index. The Brussels Stock Exchange, abbreviated to BSE, now called Euronext Brussels, is part of the European stock exchange Euronext N.V., along with Paris Bourse, Lisbon Stock Exchange and Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Its benchmark stock market index is the BEL20.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nBrussels is a centre of both media and communications in Belgium, with many Belgian television stations, radio stations, newspapers and telephone companies having their headquarters in the region. The Belgian French-language public broadcaster RTBF, the Belgian Dutch-speaking public broadcaster VRT, the two regional channels BX1 (formerly T\u00e9l\u00e9 Bruxelles) and Bruzz (formerly TV Brussel), the encrypted BeTV channel and private channels RTL-TVI and VTM are headquartered in Brussels. Some national newspapers such as Le Soir, La Libre, De Morgen and the news agency Belga are based in or around Brussels. The Belgian postal company Bpost, as well as the telecommunication companies and mobile operators Proximus, Orange Belgium and Telenet are all located there.\nAs English is spoken widely, several English media organisations operate in Brussels. The most popular of these are the English-language daily news media platform and bi-monthly magazine The Brussels Times and the quarterly magazine and website The Bulletin. The multilingual pan-European news channel Euronews also maintains an office in Brussels.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\n\nThere are several universities in Brussels. Except for the Royal Military Academy, a military college established in 1834, all universities in Brussels are private/autonomous.\nThe Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles, a French-speaking university, with about 20,000 students, has three campuses in the city, and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, a Dutch-speaking university, has about 10,000 students. Both universities originate from a single ancestor university, founded in 1834, namely the Free University of Brussels, which was split in 1970, at about the same time the Flemish and French Communities gained legislative power over the organisation of higher education.Saint-Louis University, Brussels (also known as UCLouvain Saint-Louis \u2013 Bruxelles) was founded in 1858 and is specialised in social and human sciences, with 4,000 students, and located on two campuses in the City of Brussels and Ixelles.Still other universities have campuses in Brussels, such as the French-speaking University of Louvain (UCLouvain), which has 10,000 students in the city with its medical faculties at UCLouvain Bruxelles Woluwe since 1973, in addition to its Faculty of Architecture, Architectural Engineering and Urban Planning and UCLouvain's Dutch-speaking sister Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (offering bachelor's and master's degrees in economics & business, law, arts, and architecture; 4,400 students). In addition, the University of Kent's Brussels School of International Studies is a specialised postgraduate school offering advanced international studies.\nAlso a dozen of university colleges are located in Brussels, including two drama schools, founded in 1832: the French-speaking Conservatoire Royal and its Dutch-speaking equivalent, the Koninklijk Conservatorium.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nMost of Brussels pupils between the ages of 3 and 18 go to schools organised by the French-speaking Community or the Flemish Community, with close to 80% going to French-speaking schools, and roughly 20% to Dutch-speaking schools. Due to the post-war international presence in the city, there are also a number of international schools, including the International School of Brussels, with 1,450 pupils, between the ages of 2\u200b1\u20442 and 18, the British School of Brussels, and the four European Schools, which provide free education for the children of those working in the EU institutions. The combined student population of the four European Schools in Brussels is currently around 10,000.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nBrussels has a number of public or private-owned libraries on its territory.Libraries in Brussels fall under the competence of the Communities and are usually separated between French-speaking and Dutch-speaking institutions, although some are mixed.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\n\nScience and technology in Brussels is well developed with the presence of several universities and research institutes.\nThe Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences houses the world's largest hall completely dedicated to dinosaurs, with its collection of 30 fossilised Iguanodon skeletons. The Planetarium of the Royal Observatory of Belgium is one of the largest in Europe.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\nBrussels is home to a thriving pharmaceutical and health care industry which includes pioneering biotechnology research. The health sector employs 70,000 employees in 30,000 companies. There are 3,000 life sciences researchers in the city and two large science parks: Da Vinci Research Park and Erasmus Research Park. There are five university hospitals, a military hospital and more than 40 general hospitals and specialist clinics.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is served by several airports, all of which are located outside of the administrative territory of the region. The most notable are:\n\nBrussels-National Airport, located in the nearby Flemish municipality of Zaventem, 12 km (10 mi) east of the capital;\nBrussels South Charleroi Airport, located in Gosselies, a part of the city of Charleroi (Wallonia), some 50 km (30 mi) south-west of Brussels;\nMelsbroek Air Base, located in Steenokkerzeel, is mainly a military airport and is used in a minority way for civilian travelers.The first two are also the main airports of Belgium.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nSince the 16th century, Brussels has had its own harbour, the port of Brussels. It has been enlarged throughout the centuries to become the second Belgian inland port. Historically situated near the Place Sainte-Catherine/Sint-Katelijneplein, it lies today to the northwest of the region, on the Brussels\u2013Scheldt Maritime Canal (commonly called Willebroek Canal), which connects Brussels to Antwerp via the Scheldt. Ships and large barges up to 4,500 tons can penetrate deep into the country, avoiding break-ups and load transfers between Antwerp and the centre of Brussels, hence reducing the cost for companies using the canal, and thus offering a competitive advantage.\nMoreover, the connection of the Willebroek Canal with the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Canal, in the very heart of the capital, creates a north\u2013south link, by means of waterways, between the Netherlands, Flanders and the industrial zone of Hainaut (Wallonia). There, navigation can access the network of French canals, thanks to the important inclined plane of Ronqui\u00e8res and the lifts of Str\u00e9py-Bracquegnies.\nThe importance of river traffic in Brussels makes it possible to avoid the road equivalent of 740,000 trucks per year\u2014almost 2,000 per day\u2014which, in addition to easing traffic problems, represents an estimated carbon dioxide saving of 51,545 tonnes per year.\n\n\n=== Train ===\n\nThe Brussels-Capital Region has three main train stations: Brussels-South, Brussels-Central and Brussels-North, which are also the busiest of the country. Brussels-South is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to London by Eurostar trains via the Channel Tunnel (1hr 51min); to Amsterdam by Thalys and InterCity connections; to Amsterdam, Paris (1hr 50min and 1hr 25min respectively as of 6 April 2015), and Cologne by Thalys; and to Cologne (1hr 50min) and Frankfurt (2hr 57min) by the German ICE.\nThe train rails in Brussels go underground, near the centre, through the North\u2013South connection, with Brussels Central Station also being largely underground. The tunnel itself is only six tracks wide at its narrowest point, which often causes congestion and delays due to heavy use of the route.\nThe City of Brussels has minor railway stations at Bockstael, Brussels-Chapel, Brussels-Congres, Brussels-Luxembourg, Brussels-Schuman, Brussels-West, Haren, Haren-South and Simonis. In the Brussels Region, there are also railways stations at Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Boitsfort, Boondael, Bordet (Evere), Etterbeek, Evere, Forest-East, Forest-South, Jette, Meiser (Schaerbeek), Moensberg (Uccle), Saint-Job (Uccle), Schaarbeek, Uccle-Calevoet, Uccle-Stalle, Vivier d'Oie-Diesdelle (Uccle), Merode and Watermael.\n\n\n=== City public transport ===\nThe Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company STIB/MIVB is the local public transport operator in Brussels. It covers the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region and some surface routes extend to the near suburbs in the other regions.\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nThe Brussels metro dates back to 1976, but underground lines known as the premetro have been serviced by tramways since 1968. It is the only rapid transit system in Belgium (Antwerp and Charleroi both having light rail systems). The network consists of four conventional metro lines and three premetro lines. The metro-grade lines are M1, M2, M5, and M6, with some shared sections, covering a total of 40 km (25 mi). As of 2017, the metro network within the region has a total of 69 metro and premetro stations. The metro is an important means of transport, connecting with six railway stations of the National Railway Company of Belgium (NMBS/SNCB), and many tram and bus stops operated by STIB/MIVB, and with Flemish De Lijn and Walloon TEC bus stops.\n\n\n==== Trams and buses ====\nA comprehensive bus and tram network covers the region. As of 2017, the Brussels tram system consists of 17 tram lines (three of which \u2013 lines T3, T4 and T7 \u2013 qualify as premetro lines). The total route length is 139 km (86 mi), making it one of the largest tram networks in Europe. The Brussels bus network is complementary to the rail network. It consists of 50 bus routes and 11 night routes, spanning 445 km (277 mi). Since April 2007, STIB/MIVB has been operating a night bus network called Noctis. On Fridays and Saturdays, 11 bus routes operate from midnight until 3 a.m. They run from the centre of Brussels to the outer reaches of the Brussels-Capital Region.\n\n\n==== Ticketing ====\nAn interticketing system means that a STIB/MIVB ticket holder can use the train or long-distance buses inside the region. A single journey can include multiple stages across the different modes of transport. The commuter services operated by De Lijn, TEC and NMBS/SNCB will, in the next few years, be augmented by the Brussels Regional Express Network (RER/GEN), which will connect the capital and surrounding towns. Since August 2016, paper tickets have been discontinued in favour of electronic MoBIB cards.\n\n\n==== Other public transport ====\nSince 2003, Brussels has had a car-sharing service operated by the Bremen company Cambio, in partnership with the STIB/MIVB and local ridesharing company Taxi Stop. In 2006, a public bicycle-sharing programme was introduced. The scheme was subsequently taken over by Villo!. Since 2008, this night-time public transport service has been supplemented by Collecto, a shared taxi system, which operates on weekdays between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. In 2012, the Zen Car electric car-sharing scheme was launched in the university and European areas.\n\n\n=== Road network ===\n\nIn medieval times, Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north\u2013south (the modern Rue Haute/Hoogstraat) and east\u2013west (Chauss\u00e9e de Gand/Gentsesteenweg-Rue du March\u00e9 aux Herbes/Grasmarkt-Rue de Namur/Naamsestraat). The ancient pattern of streets, radiating from the Grand Place, in large part remains, but has been overlaid by boulevards built over the River Senne, over the city walls and over the railway connection between the North and South Stations.\nToday, Brussels has the most congested traffic in North America and Europe, according to US traffic information platform INRIX.\nBrussels is the hub of a range of old national roads, the main ones being clockwise: the N1 (N to Breda), N2 (E to Maastricht), N3 (E to Aachen), N4 (SE to Luxembourg) N5 (S to Rheims), N6 (S to Maubeuge), N7 (SW to Lille), N8 (W to Koksijde) and N9 (NW to Ostend). Usually named chauss\u00e9es/steenwegen, these highways normally run in a straight line, but sometimes lose themselves in a maze of narrow shopping streets.\nThe region is skirted by the European route E19 (N-S) and the E40 (E-W), while the E411 leads away to the SE. Brussels has an orbital motorway, numbered R0 (R-zero) and commonly referred to as the Ring. It is pear-shaped, as the southern side was never built as originally conceived, owing to residents' objections.\nThe city centre, sometimes known as the Pentagon, is surrounded by an inner ring road, the Small Ring (French: Petite Ceinture, Dutch: Kleine Ring), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered R20 or N0. These were built upon the site of the second set of city walls following their demolition. The metro line 2 runs under much of these. Since June 2015, a number of central boulevards inside the Pentagon have become car-free, limiting transit traffic through the old city.On the eastern side of the region, the R21 or Greater Ring (French: Grande Ceinture, Dutch: Grote Ring) is formed by a string of boulevards that curves round from Laeken to Uccle. Some premetro stations (see Brussels metro) were built on that route. A little further out, a stretch numbered R22 leads from Zaventem to Saint-Job.\n\n\n== Security and emergency services ==\n\n\n=== Police ===\n\nThe Brussels local police, supported by the federal police, is responsible for law enforcement in Brussels. The 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region are divided into six police zones, all bilingual (French and Dutch):\n\n5339 Brussels Capital Ixelles: the City of Brussels and Ixelles\n5340 Brussels West: Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Ganshoren, Jette, Koekelberg and Molenbeek-Saint-Jean\n5341 South: Anderlecht, Forest and Saint-Gilles\n5342 Uccle/Watermael-Boitsfort/Auderghem: Auderghem, Uccle and Watermael-Boitsfort\n5343 Montgomery: Etterbeek, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert et Woluwe-Saint-Pierre\n5344 Polbruno: Evere, Saint-Josse-ten-Noode et Schaerbeek\n\n\n=== Fire department ===\nThe Brussels Fire and Emergency Medical Care Service, commonly known by its acronym SIAMU (DBDMH), operates in the 19 municipalities of Brussels. It is a class X fire department and the largest fire service in Belgium in terms of annual operations, equipment, and personnel. It has 9 fire stations, spread over the entire Brussels-Capital Region, and employs about 1,000 professional firefighters. As well as preventing and fighting fires, SIAMU also provides emergency medical care services in Brussels via its centralised 100 number (and the single 112 emergency number for the 27 countries of the European Union). It is bilingual (French\u2013Dutch).\n\n\n== Parks and green spaces ==\n\nBrussels is one of the greenest capitals in Europe, with over 8,000 hectares of green spaces. Vegetation cover and natural areas are higher in the outskirts, where they have limited the peri-urbanisation of the capital, but they decrease sharply towards the centre of Brussels; 10% in the central Pentagon, 30% of the municipalities in the first ring, and 71% of the municipalities in the second ring are occupied by green spaces.\nMany parks and gardens, both public and privately owned, are scattered throughout the city. In addition to this, the Sonian Forest is located in its southern part and stretches out over the three Belgian regions. As of 2017, it has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the only Belgian component to the multinational inscription 'Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe'.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\n\nBrussels is twinned with the following cities:\n\n\n== Rankings ==\nAs of 2016, the Brussels-Capital Region is ranked the 12th largest capital city of the European Union.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBourgeois of Brussels\nBrussels Regional Investment Company\nOutline of Belgium\nSeven Noble Houses of Brussels\nStatue of Europe\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nWolmar, Christian (2010).

          "Step back in time by taking the old wooden escalators down to the under group tunnel. Very unique way to travel to the other-side of the water to witness Antwerps beautiful skyline.",
          "As this was our first trip to Antwerp, I was a little perplexed as to the lack of bridges crossing the river. Many cities make use of bridges across rivers. But not here. The riddle was solved as we walked down the river and came across an art deco tower that we just had to",
          "This tunnel should be on be on the list of must sees for everyone who visits Antwerp. Dating back to the 1930's it is quite elegant with the Art Deco buildings, the wooden escalators and the large lift. It is very neat, clean and tidy, safe and very well used. There are also",
          "When in Antwerp, try to find 30 minutes to experience the wonder of this vintage pedestrian tunnel. The views back across the river Scheldt from the Linkeroever suburb towards the city and down the river towards the extensive docklands are superb. The vertiginous wooden",
          "Take the old wooden staircases down and walk under the river towards the other side. From the other bank you\u00b4ve a great view of Antwerp.",
          "Still functioning wooden (!) escalators from the 1930s and a spectacular, clean and tidy white-tiled tunnel.... all this in the heart of a city of half a million people. Do not miss it!",
          "We loved this beautiful Art Deco building to enter the tunnel as well as the wooden escalators built 1930 which are still functioning.",
          "Must tunnels smell of urine and dirty. Not this one, its clean and largely smell free but a long walk with no view.",
          "Beautiful staircase and observation on the city . Easy to arrive by tram from the .central train station",
          "A very pleasant stroll down two sets of wooden escalators. The tunnel is about 550 metres long but not much to see! Suggest, take the tunnel one way and return via the free ferry",
          "This definitely isn\u2019t a must but if you are in the area the wooden escalators are an interesting part of history. The are very long and very clunky. You travel back in time with the noise and the smell of the wood. Enjoyable.",
          "One of my highlights of my visit to Antwerp - I love places like this which aren't really touristy but are more often used by locals albeit somewhere that has architectural interest. A very plain, utilitarian instillation. The lift, escalators and tunnel were very well",
          "I wouldn't have know about this tunnel if we weren't brought here on a bike tour. we accessed it by a large elevator. Riding through the tunnel was fun.",
          "This is probably the easiest way to get from one side of the river Schelde to the other, you can take the escalator or the lift up and down, then walk the entire tunnel to the other side, bikes are also allowed but you need to walk your bike to the other side. Easy but of course",
          "I came here mainly because there was a Geocache hidden on either side. Quite unusual to find caches so deep underground. Good to see an old wooden escalator still working. There's a life provided as well. I was surprised that most cyclists chose the escalator rather than the",
          "How many times do you get to ride your bicycle into a lift or take your bike on the escalator ? Lovely shared space for bicycles, pedestrians, prams and dogs. We rode across and back taking in the views from each side. Reminds me of the Tyne Pedestrian & Cycle tunnel.",
          "It's a nearly hundred years old wooden escalator leading to a tunnel that spans between the two banks of the river Schelde. When you ride down there is a unique smell of old wood, dust and engine oil, reminding you of the days old gone. If you wish to pass to another side",
          "A remarkable tunnel that takes you back in time. Not a destination as such, but if you want to cross the river this is one of the best ways to do. Especially on a hot summer day it's the perfect place to cool down.",
          "I visited on the hottest day on record in Belgian history. Got the tram from Groenplaats to Van Eeden, the entrance to the tunnel is nearby - but go to the river first to see the Old Town from there. The tunnel was 10 degrees cooler than outside. I got the lift on one side, and",
          "I know it sounds crazy .. but this tunnel under the river IS worth the experience (if only to look at the city from the other side over a (huge) sandwich and pint at the Retro Cafe). The history and engineering around the construction is fascinating - and told along the walls",
          "Smells of old wood and grease - just like my grandad's workshop. I loved this so much. And it's completely free. The weather was extraordinarily hot, so it was also great to be in the cool tunnel.",
          "Heard about this place from a walking tour, so decided to check it out. I really like the old Soviet subways in Eastern Europe, so this sounded like something cool and it is. It wasn't that easy to find the building (see the photo), but once I did, it's easy enough to head in,",
          "Great if you happen to be a rabbit or a meerkat! Mind it does what it says on the tin! Avoid the excitement.",
          "Beware : for the next few months, work will be in progress either on the left bank and on the right bank of the river 'Scheldt'. Escallator and elevator will be out of order but not simultaniously.",
          "Opened in 1933, this 572 metre tunnel, with it's lovely wooden escalators leading down to it, is a fun way to get a bit of exercise. The suburb on the other side looks a bit grim but views back over the river are nice.",
          "Old wooden escalators move pedestrians, bicyclists, scooters, joggers and more up and down to the floor of the tunnel. Whatever your mode of transport you are now all in it together. Pedestrians saunter thru staying close to the arch shaped walls, the rest wiz by in the center.",
          "Definitely worth trying if you like a good walk and love a retro vibe. Be sure to take the escalators in order to really feel how deep down your going. The best part when emerging on the other side is the great view of Antwerpen and the free ferry which takes you back to the old",
          "This is the best connection for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the river Scheldt. Elevators are old, unreliable and slow. Escalators are faster but a bit crowded with all the cyclists blocking them. Cyclists typically also drive way too fast despite the supposed speed limit.",
          "When visiting Antwerp with our Belgian relatives we decided to talk the St. Anna\u2019s tunnel to the other side of the Schelde river. The 572 m tunnel was built in 1931 as part of the extension of Antwerp town to the other side of the river. At the time the Eastern side only had a",
          "There are a number of bars on the city side for a coffee or drink before tackling the tunnel. The old wooden escalators are very like those that used to operate on the London Underground so was a blast from the past for us. Take time to look at the tiles at either end as you",
          "I did this on my first evening in Antwerp. Cycle through the tunnel, eat Frites, see Antwerp sky line by night and return to the centre. Fun and interesting.",
          "We went down the two escalators and stood to watch without walking across under the river. There is an elevator, the central entrance, but you go in at the left or right sides for the escalator. Watch out for the bikes as they are very fast. The bikers zip into the elevator",
          "This is a really unique tunnel which I have never seen or heard about anything like this before. You can tell this as the Photographers are all about trying to get the best shot. But well worth a look when in Anwerp",
          "Before going to Antwarp I was looking for new things to do there and St.Anna's Pedestrian tunnel popped up. WOW...The escalators are authentic from the industrial period. It's a 10 min walk on the tunnel and view from the othar side is definitely worth it",
          "St. Anna's Tunnel / Pedestrians' Tunnel is a good way to spend a bit of time doing something different. You take the original timber escalators or if you are feeling a bit lazy, take the lift down to the tunnel. This is both for pedestrians and cyclists. It can get a bit too",
          "The escalators are authentic from the industrial period. The tunnel itself was pretty meh, and there is really no order for where pedestrians and bikes should go. But the concept and history of the tunnel is interesting.",
          "I was looking for things to do in Antwerp and St.Anna's Pedestrian tunnel popped up. Running under the Schelde River, it has escalators made of wood and they look amazing. Once at the other end there are stunning views of the city of Antwerp",
          "Nice long tunnel under the river Schelde. You can use the wooden escalator or the lift to go down/up. The tunnel takes you to Linkeroever where you can go for a walk and have amazing views of the city across the river. When in Antwerp, I would definitely recommend a visit. On",
          "Long stretch of pedestrian / cyclist tunnel. That runs under ground, below the Scheldt River. It stretched about 600m.nice walk across. There after.,took a free ferry back that operate both ways. It took all of 2 mins for the ferry ride. Interesting.",
          "A day in Antwerp on bikes discover one side or both side of the river is a must! The old wooden escalators on both ends with bikes are a breeze. Renting the city bikes is the best as every 30 minutes you can return them, wait 5 minutes and take another one for free..$4. for the",
          "It's a short walk across the tunnel, no more than 10 mins perhaps. On a day with decent weather, it would make for an excellent stroll along the river. Relatively quiet and away from the hustle-bustle of the city, offering a great vista of the river and the city.",
          "We heard about this tunnel from a tour guide on a free walking trip, we would have never found it otherwise even though it was 100mtrs from the cruise ship docking area. A wonderful old wooden escalator takes you down to a tunnel, 500 mtrs in length, to the other side of the",
          "Good to walk through and see the views of Antwerp when you reach the other side. Enjoy a coffee then get the boat back",
          "There was lots of pedestrian traffic at the St. Anna's Tunnel / Pedestrians Tunnel in both directions so it felt safe to walk. The bicycles stuck to the middle so you do have to watch for them they did not seem to have bells, I am thinking there are so many locals are used to",
          "This tunnel is easily accessible on both side if the bank. If yiy come from the town hall, just head towards the river and make a left turn. Look for a boring looking and old industrial looking building with cyclists emerging (see attached pix). A charming 572 long tunnel that",
          "What a great way to get across the river. The wooden escalators are like something out of a Flash Gordon Movie, Real Art Deco. They are in excellent condition. The tunnel itself is so bright and clean. Keep a watch out for bicycles though. (10 minute walk) On the other side of",
          "Just keep walking. It is full of bicycle riders and can be quite hair raising of a walk as they speed by you. A unique experience.",
          "This is a very historic tunnel that is worth the walk under the river. The wooden escalator is in amazing condition. On the other side you get a good view of Antwerp.",
          "If you want to have the best view of the city for sunrise, sunset, nightime, or really any time, you should go through this tunnel. You can also take the ferry, but this is really cool. You can always take the ferry one way and the tunnel the other! I did this every day I was",
          "This is just out of the ordinary! Saw it on trip advisor and decided to give it a go! The escalators are of another era wooden. Once down the bottom you have to be prepared to share your walk with many speeding bikes!! They can be very off putting but if you keep walking and",
          "This art deco walking tunnel under de Schelde river is worth a visit. I always enjoyed the architecture of this place on my visits to the left bank.",
          "A true marvel of engineering . The tunnel is underwater and joins the old town of Antwerpen to Linkerover . Its restricted to pedestrians and cyclists. The escalators are wooden ones and immaculately maintained. The lift is pretty spacious too and allows cycles . It is a little",
          "This underground tunnel allows you to walk between Antwerp and The Netherlands. It's reached by a pair of beautiful antique escalators. There is an exhibit explaining its construction history, which was interesting. It was beautifully lit up for Pride weekend when we visited.",
          "Antwerpen doesn't have any bridges on river Schelda,so the only way to cross it is taking a ferry or using this outstanding tunnel which was built in the 1930s. It's not the typical turistic attraction, but it' s absolutely a \"must see\" considering the age when it was built and",
          "It is a nice experience and an easy way to move between the two embankment of the river Scheldt. The view from the right embankment is nice.",
          "This was a fun experience! Especially if you take a bike and go around the city with no rush, it is definitely worth of the little adventure. You can find a nice view over the city on the \"other\" side of the water, but other than that there was not that much to see.",
          "One of the nice things to see in Antwep, is taking the wooden escalators and walking the underwater tunnel to the other side of the river. Note the tunnel doesnt start at the river bank, but at a brown building that you access",
          "This is an interesting walk from the north bank to the south bank of the Schelde River through a tunnel. It doesn't take that long - it took me 15 minutes. On the other side you can get a great photo of the north bank with the skyline of Antwerp. Another interesting feature of",
          "A 1 km walk takes you to the left bank of the Schelde River where you can admire the view of Antwerp's historic center. It is also interesting to experience the operation of the wooden escalators that take you underground. Note that the tunnel is also open to bicycles, and you",
          "Antwerp is so full of pretty old buildings, amazing squares and other magnificent sights. But this tunnel and especially the wooden escalators from 1932 really touched a soft spot in my heart. At least try the escalators - it\u2019s a must-do. If you have the energy walk the 572",
          "In 1932 two tunnels were dug under the Schelde river. One with two lanes for cars (looking a lot like New York's Lincoln Tunnel); the other for pedestrians and cyclists. It is really worth a visit: take the original wooden escalators that take you deep underground. Then walk",
          "An exciting experience travelling under the river. The tunnel entrance is out of the way in a square building, hidden by construction work. To walk to the other side, it takes about 10-15 minutes depending how fast you are walking. Bikes are able to use the tunnel too. On the",
          "It is not only interesting and historical but also impressive. A cheap must of the city not far from the cathedral.",
          "Not so many places in the world still exhibit a wooden escalator... and this is what you can experience by heading deep into ground to the St Anna's tunnel. Cool and fun.",
          "The pedestrians' tunnel is an easy way to get from the left side of Antwerp to the right (or the other way of course). You walk underneath/through te river. You take the escalator down. These escalators will truly be the most beautiful ones you've ever seen. These wooden",
          "This pedestrians tunnel is fun just to have an experience walking under a river. Once on the left bank a short walk takes you to a free ferry boat trip back. The only pity was the locals on bicycles not adhering to the 5kph speed limit",
          "A good walk through the tunnel - nice to see the old wooden escalators. Unusual way to visit either side of the river. Watch out for some errant cyclists though. Most are fine but there are some who think it is a racetrack!!",
          "I am so excited every time I see these stairs. It's amazing that they are so old and still working. It's like travelling back in time to be in this tunnel. It's definitely worth a visit. Pay attention to the sound and the smell! It's free, btw.",
          "Fantastic building on the old city side of the river with a wooden lift and interesting architecture. Would not matter if you walked through but we cycled in a circular route through a couple of different tunnels as St Anna's is not the only one but the most interesting.",
          "We really just went through as we were \"geocaching\". It is a different experience to descend with either the lift or escalator and then to walk under the river. We then had a lovely walk on the other side and saw a completely different side of Antwerp.",
          "First, a brief description of the river Schelde - this opens to the North sea and is where the Port of Antwerp is situated. Ships pass through it. Imagine a tunnel dug under this river, so people can walk (or ride their bikes) to the other side of the river! That is the",
          "This surely was an almost spotless area. Good to walk. Even cyclists are tolerated. Though this stretch only measured about 550metres, it is impressive how it was once built.",
          "I guess it is kind of interesting to walk under a river, but it is kind of a long walk and once you get to one side, you have to walk back. We at night, so we did get a good view of Antwerp all lit up from the far side. I'd do it again, but it wasn't the most exciting thing in",
          "Not many cities have this kind of pedestrian tunnel in a perfectly maintained shape since .... years, walk through en sail back with the river ferry (it's free!)",
          "Horrible experience! Arriving there, the lfts don't work, so going done with a bicycle by foot/ Also the rolling paths don't work, again going down by foor with a bicycle. The same on the left bank side, but then climbing up. I felt ashame for the bicycle tourist that come to",
          "From the tranquility and the beautiful skyline of the city to the flamboyant center in 550 meters. While doing this you walk through the industrial revolution.",
          "This might not sound like the obvious thing to do when in Antwerp, but I think its worth it. Its basically a long tunnel which runs under the river. You can walk through it and when you get to the other side, you can ride the old wooden escalator to the top and take a shirt walk",
          "Ok so this is a foot tunnel under the river. It probably doesn\u2019t go anywhere you want to go either. But you know what? Its well worth a visit. The Art Deco design, the amazing wooden escalators and a pictorial history of the construction makes this a photography experience not",
          "This is totally worth a visit and a walk when in Antwerp. The tunnel runs under the river and is just over 500 meters long. The best part are the wood escalators that date back to the tunnels origin. Absolutely gorgeous woodwork on those things. The tunnel is very well kept,",
          "Dating from 1933 this is a monument you really have to visit. A real beauty. The old wooden escalators in the white painted tunnel are breathtaking.",
          "Interesting tunnel, with original wooden escalators still in working order, impressive. It's good to walk off a heavy lunch through here and see how the locals use it.",
          "Walk or bike to the left side taking this \"old\" ( build in 1931-1933) tunnel. Walk from there to the river side to enjoy the huge panorama of the river Schelde and the harbour and city skyline. Two old escalators or a big lift brings you -31 meters down to the long narrow",
          "A nice old tunnel. it is long a half kilometer. it is a nice walk if bieng part of the schelde walk not intresting to go only for this.",
          "It saved us from heavy rain! And actually it is pretty interesting, 30 meters underground and you enter it using an elevator (which you of course share with a lot of cyclers).",
          "Just nice to take the escalators, with well preserved wooden details, down to the pederstrian tunnel that can take you to the other side of the Schelde. Although it's designed as a pedestrian tunnel cyclists are also allowed to use the tunnel. You can also use the elevator to go",
          "Antwerp was clearly an ambitious city between the wars. Not only did it host the summer Olympics in 1920 and build the marvellous KBC building in the 1930s but it undertook construction of this amazing tunnel under the river. It's odd when you see that there's no central bridge",
          "One of the things you want to do when in Antwerp We went to visit a couple of friends and they took us for a walk through We began our walk with the beautiful wood escalators. We had a dog, so one of us had to go into the elevator. It felt good to walk through the tunnel.",
          "Well, it's kinda special and unique taking the old elevator or the stairs down, and biking or walking through this tunnel. And very refreshing on a hot day!",
          "This old tunnel connects the old Antwerp to the other side of the river. Worth a visit? mmwwwah. The old wooden escalators aer nice, and others rave about the tiles. I found it not really intresting. The view from the other side is also not veru inspiring.",
          "Rent a bike or walk to the other side of the Schelde. Great views and photo opportunities of Antwerp from the left bank.",
          "Wow - built under the river and around 500 metres in length. There is an old wooden escalator which is very steep (so beware if you haven't a head for heights). There is also a lift which is used in the main by cyclists and when we were there these were plentiful. Beware - they",
          "Tunnel under the river. Useful to cross. Interesting history but not really worth the visit. See it more as a nostalgic remnant of an old passage under the water.",
          "Traversed this tunnel as part of an Antwerp Bike Tour. Simply amazing as you use either an escalator (interesting with bike) or lift to descend 33 metres. Tunnel is then something like 500 metres long and is really busy. Antwerp is the only european river city without a",
          "Pedestrian Tunnel and Now also a Free Ferry Boat ( starting from Steenplein ) to left bank. Fun and nice scenery !",
          "when you are not from Antwerp you might not understand the big deal between right & left bank...and it might one day become an urban legend :). Anyway, take the old fashion stairs down and walk under the river to see the skyline from the left bank side. Enjoy a drink and",
          "Long tunnel to go through, well maintained with old elevator! It seems to be a regular way to go by foot, bike, skate etc.... Nice to see!",
          "Easy ten minute pedestrian walk or bike way connecting old city centre with east side of town. There you'll find the best skyline view of Antwerp. Must see for lovers of the 1930's and photographers.",
          "St Anna's Tunnel links the left and right bank of the River Schelde. At nearly 600m, this is apparently the quickest way to get to the other side. It\u2019s a surreal adventure to go through this tube-shaped tunnel, lined with simple white ceramic tiles. The contrast between upper",
          "When we lived in Kruibeke we parked our car in Linkeroever and walked to Antwerp via this tunnel. It's the quickest way to get here during the rush hours (nowadays it's always rush hour..)",
          "The view when you walk towards the tunnel is appealing. An old building form the outside leads to a steampunk-like escalator, bringing you down to the long tunnel, where you walk about 500 meters to the outher side of the Schelde. Truely worth the walk. Inside the tunnel the",
          "Lovely place with beautiful old wooden escalators. A lot of local artists use this tunnel to make pictures for their portfolio. I use it by bike to go swimming,.. there is a open air swimmingpool on the other side of the river called 'De Molen'. once you come out of the tunnel",
          "Walking through this tunnel, which dates back to the beginning of the 20th century, is an excellent way to cross the river. The wooden moving escalators at both sides are some of the oldest in Europe. On a hot day, it can still get pretty cold in the tunnel, so dress accordingly",
          "Anytime you can visit it. Its free. There nothing fascinating but walking in long tunnel under water after using old aged wooden Elevators 34 metere deep is something fun stuff to do",
          "This is the old pedestrians' tunnel under the river 'Schelde', always nice to go a little bit back in time and enjoy the walk. Nice, clean and chilly (certainly on a hot day) and this in combination with a nostalgic feel. A must do...",
          "This tunnel is just unique since ur literally walking under or inside the water , crossing places from one end to the other , if you have an hour just go to schelde and give enjoy the view of the canal and then do the cross ,",
          "An interesting place to see if you have a spare hour. The original wooden escalators are quirky. The tunnel appears never ending but it's not that long. One if those places to tick off the list and say you've been.",
          "At about 1/3 mile long, this under river tunnel is worth the time to walk through and back. The mainly wooden escalators at both ends are as old as any I've seen on the London underground, they take me back to my childhood days, maybe that's why I like this place so much.",
          "Sint-Annatunnel is the best way to cross the river in order to watch the city skyline from the left bank. Unmissable !",
          "This is one of the things to see if you visit Antwerp. Make a walke to the other side of the river. (Linkeroever) As soon you go in and step on the wooden steps you walk back in time. Just do it and it's free.",
          "This is a fun walk to the other border of the river Schelde. The escalators are old/great. On the border of Linkeroever you have a nice view of the skyline of the city.",
          "Sint-Annatunnel is a fascinating bit of old engineering. The long wooden escalators are worth checking out even if you're not interested in going across to Linkeroever. It's always chilly down there, which is kind of nice on a hot summer day...and not bad on a cold, windy and/or",
          "The tunnel itself is not a big deal, but the wood escalator is definitely worth the visit. If you are nearby, go down the stairs to the tunnel and check it out!",

          "It's worth seeing especially if you are into architecture. I found those wooden stairs incredible! Also on the other side if the river, you can discover a totaly differend side on the city - i find this interesting, like a local silent area hidden from tourists. There is also a",
          "This is a fun landmark. You can cross the Schelde river on foot or by bicycle through this tunnel. It's a small Art Deco building and it still has authentic escalators. Do the crossing as you will get the best view of Antwerp from the other side of the river.",
          "Walking 2 x 600 metres through a straight tunnel with absolutely nothing to look at sounds boring. Yet I found it intrigueing to find myself deep under a large river, and it was certainly worth while viewing Antwerpen from the opposite river bank at dusk.",
          "I liked the style and technology of this early 20th century tunneltube beneath the river Scheld. It's very heavy elevators end the long tiled tube, the historic pannels. When you turn up above again, take a beer and look back to the river!",
          "This very special pathway is not only worth to see, but also very conveniant when parking on the other side of the river , opposite old town Antwerpen. The old woodden escalators put you back at least into the fifties - if you are old enough to remember. The tunnel was built in",
          "The old, wooden escalator is extraordinary. We walked through the tunnel with our bicycles along with a group of singing school children - very charming!",
          "Super cool little tunnel that goes under the river. I was recommended to visit it by a local, so I did and was not disappointed. You descend 50 meters or so by escalator and then get to walk 500 m under the water (you cant see sadly) to the other side of the city. On the other",
          "considering the age of the tunnel its a pretty amazing visit. The escalators are all old school and its around 30m deep, great view from the other side as well!!",
          "Given the fact that this is the oldest tunnel of this kind in the world, it is simply an engineering marvel. It is fun, even kinda eerie to take the long escalators down and walk inside. Knowing that you are walking under a river makes you respect the engineers much more. The",
          "Living in Greenwich with its own foot tunnel under a major river it was very interesting to visit this wonderful tunnel. Used by cyclists and pedestrians alike it is worth walking the 600+ metres under the Schelde over to the other side for a good view back over Antwerp. Some",
          "St. Anna Tunnel is probably the oldest tunnel of this kind in the world. Apparently before the WWII the progress of the digging of the tunnel were followed everywhere in the world. I prefer to cross it by bike than walk it.",
          "but the view you get when you get to the other side! Walking in the tunel was kind of disappointing but on the other side you get to see the city skyline from a distance and I think that is what made it worthy.",
          "Such a long and straight tunnel for pedestrians is an odd sight indeed but it's an experience worth doing, in the tunnel the only sound you hear is the constant rumbling of the old escalators on either end. A surprisingly clean tunnel putting the British subways to shame. The",
          "Its fun to walk under the river! go deep down the stairs or take the elevator and walk straight into the heart of the city :)",
          "Whilst on a City walk in Antwerp, the Guide told us about St Anna Tunnel which runs under the River Scheldt, so we decided to investigate. You first of all descend either by a very large lift or by 2 very long wooden escalators to a straight tunnel which then took us 11 minutes",
          "I was a bit concerned about the safety of the tunnel, because there were not many people and some weird guys were hanging at the entrance. But actually at least to me nothing bad happened. However, you have to keep in mind that if you go through the tunnel, you will have to come",
          "Long quiet place, must visit! Nice spot for a photoshoot or just to relax and find some mental peace.",
          "want another view on Antwerp, cross the water by foot or bike and use this tunnel. go down with an elevator and make your crossing in this tiled tunnel. other side gives a fantastic view on the city and has a small beach with several restaurants and terraces",
          "We popped in to the tunnel entrance and went down on the escalators, having viewed the lift too. The whole place is most atmospheric. We didn't have time to walk the length of the tunnel.",
          "While in Antwerp, be sure to check out the Old Wooden Escalator to the tunnel that crosses under the Scheldt River. You'd never know this is the place to do this. People with bicycles, dogs, kids, strollers, etc., use this means to get to the other side easily. A fun",
          "It was my first time crossing a river by walking under it. Pretty remarkable wooden elevators which look ancient but were in perfect condition. If you are on a bicycle, no sweat! There are lifts too that bring you down about 6 storeys. Then there's that 1 kilometre stretch that",
          "It is quite a good walk to the other side of the river. Nothing much on the other side, but quite peaceful. Very popular tunnel with locals.",
          "You go in through a simple building on the side of the river, down two sets of perfectly preserved wooden escalators and find yourself 31m down in a perfectly straight tunnel. Very quiet, a good shelter from the rain, but fascinating to see locals using this astounding place as",
          "Quite easy to find from Grand-Place, the station is an old art-deco style building that looks a bit like a fire station. Cool old escalators that take you down to the tunnel where it's about a 10 minute walk under the river to the other side. There's not much happening on the",
          "Old-fashioned tunnel stretching about 600 meteres underwater connecting two parts of the city. The stairway from mid-20th century is an atttraction in itself. Watch the bikers pass by and enjoy the scenario to a perfect picture inside the tunnel.",
          "A really long tunnel, with some impressive old escalators. In summer it's quite nice, since it's colder in the tunnel than outside. Beware of people on bikes flashing by!",
          "What an art deco gem! Beautiful stairs and well maintained. Just don't take a fall in the middle of the tunnel as you won't know which direction to take after getting back up!",
          "It's easy to reach on food from the Cathedral and the Square. It's worth the 5 minute walk to see it...and also to see the very old wooden escalator that is still in use. It's not a \"must see\", but is worth it if you have the time.",
          "If you're biking around Antwerp, this is a fun diversion. Get the elevator down from the little square bounded by Sint Jansvliet, Ernest van Dijckaai, and Zand (it took me awhile to realize that). The LED above the elevator tells you where it is, beginning at around -30M and",
          "From the P&R to the city centre you can get a lift and walk though the tunnel to the city center! Really safe and quick!",
          "Tunnel under the river with wooden escalators...the tunnel is long and takes you to the other side of Antwerp across the river ...you can always return by bus or train in case you don't want to walk back..the escalators are steep,you can even find people cycling there...the",
          "awesome tunnel ... excellent experince to the wal through the tunnel ... you can feel the river above .. also dont miss to take some pictures from the heavy wooden escalators",
          "Its really interesting, really deep bellow, watching bicycles passing you by is really fun, looks neverending from the entrance, location for several photoshoots",
          "The smell of the half-century-old wooden escalators is reminiscent of... of... something... of wooden escalators from a half-century ago. I like the lift too, although I wish the door would close faster. The acoustics are great in the tunnel. Nice that they don't allow motor",
          "Enter the old building left of the elavator and you'll see the very old wooden escalators. Go down and take the second one too.",
          "First off a warning: even though this is not particularly claustrofobic I do know people who can get very uncomfortable in this tunnel. The tunnel under the river Schelde is one of the best free things one can do in Antwerp. The style of the tunnel is 30's and it's managed to",
          "This is a tunnel under the Schelde, so it is a bit of a walk, but it's a marvel of white tiles and '30 years architecture. The elevators are still original ! Enjoy the left bank and the view of the city. You can always return with the tram just next to the entrance on the left",
          "Always nice to take a walk trough this tunnel when strolling down Hoogstraat and Kloosterstraat on a Sunday. This pedestrian tunnel has 80 years old wooden escalators and takes you to the left bank of the river Scheldt where you can enjoy the view over Antwerp and have a Belgian",
          "Always love walking tunnels under rivers and this old gem well worth the little diversion. TIP catch the tram one stop to the other side of the river from the City and as you come out head to the river and the isolated building which is the entrance. Just enjoy the olde world",
          "Used the tunnel for our bike trip exodus from city centre. Great engineering that provided a vivid memory.",
          "We revisited this tunnel again for our grown children to experience as they were toddlers on our first visit. It was an enjoyable trip with ones family to the left bank. The skylight view was amazing. We also got to play at the near by park. It was interesting.",
          "We enjoyed the walk on the old wooden escalators and through the tunnel and back. The view back towards Antwerp was not so interesting as we were lead to believe",
          "We crossed the river from the West Bank using the cycle and pedestrian tunnel. It goes down 30 metres then 500 metres across and under the river and back up an elevator on the other side. Imagine walking along a London tube station where there are no trains on the line, or a",
          "nice tunnel, very cool in the summer, goes under the schelde to the left bank where it is very quiet, restaurants and bars on each side of the bank",
          "It is interesting to know that linkerover is only accessible on foot or by bike through the voetgangerstunnel aka st anna tunnel. Fro linerover you have a nice skyline view of downtown Antwerp",
          "Impressive achievement-it's buit in the early 30's.572m long,31m under the Schelde river. Old wooden escalators,a huge 40 people elevator.",
          "During our visit to the center of Antwerp, we made a detour through st anna's tunnel, and boy was it worth it. Nice little market in front of the tunnel made it extra pleasant. We biked through the tunnel with a special lift, quite an experience, to have a totally different view",
          "During a recent business trip, I went through this tunnel twice. It's fun, interesting to see the different mix of people, and you get a good view of old Antwerp from the \"Left Bank\". Do note they escalators close at 10:00 pm, but the elevator is still operational, the tunnel",
          "Return to the 1930s by taking the vintage timber escalator or the Art Deco elevator to this pedestrian tunnel. Have not seem anything of its kind anywhere else.",
          "We walked through the tunnel to see what our city guide app says is what makes native people proud of their city, and found 6 idiots peeing in the bushes just outside the exit. The view across to the city centre is marred by the steel girders of the and old ferry port/market",
          "The charm of the wooden escalator and the ability to say you walked under the river to the eastern shore make this a must see. And the price is right, at free!",
          "Park your car on the left bank of the Schelde and come by foot throught the St. Anna Tunnel, a nice (historical) tunnel where a lot of photographs are taken by amateur & professional photographers",
          "Walk under the river to the other side, take a few pictures and walk back. Ride a wooden escalator which is a little noisy and return. Thats all there is to it, but it is free.",
          "Crossing the tunnel under the river Schelde, walking or by bike, is an experience you shouldn't miss! The escalators are the original wooden ones and the oldest in Europe. There is also an elevator for bikes/wheelchairs. Until the 1950's you had to pay to cross, luckily for us",
          "A deep dive under the river and and great sight from the other side when coming out and walking back. Also few good restaurants at the other side with great views on twon, especially when able to eat outside.",
          "Loved the exciting experience of walking under a river, surely recommended! There are couple of nice cafe on other side of the the tunnel, a chance fir a belgium waffel experience as well!",
          "a tip for photographers: walk under the water to the left bank - the tunnel itself offers great photo-ops. this tunnel has starred in many movies! And across, on the left bank, you 'come out of the water' on the exact spot where you get the most spectacular skyline view of",
          "It was awesome seeing Antwerp from this view. They even have an e,evaporated to carry you down to the tunnel. It was a 5KM walk.",
          "just for a wolk under the streem \"de Schelde\", from one side to the other... No trafic only for walking or riding the bycicle",
          "It is a bit scary affair as the tunnen is half a kilometer long and very old with wooden escalators. But it is enjoyable. The peak is when you are in the middel and you do not see the begin and the end of the tunnel. Across the tunnel the view was not that beautiful as we",
          "Walking through this pedestrian tunnel is a lot of fun. It's wacky to stand at one end and stare down towards the other end. The walls hit a vanishing point before you can actually see the other side. And once you get to the other side, you have a fantastic view of Antwerp.",
          "You surely need not to suffer claustrophobia in order to get inside the tunnel! It's a bit \"scary\" the moment you are kind in the middle of it and you realize you cannot see the entrance nor the exit. But it's so much fun! The structure is made in order to resist the strong",
          "the tunnel is a pedestrian tunnel , very unique, try it out walk through and on the other side is a great vieuw of the city",
          "Tunnel of 500 mts. Under the Scheldt river built in 1931. Original wood escalators, original old wood escalator noise! You can walk it, bike it acces by lift for bikes and wheelchairs. Good to do it on a rainy day.once on the other side take a walk along the river to the",
          "The only walking access to Linkeroever - where you have to go to look at the Antwerp skyline across the river..... Quaint period construction with the only wooden escalator I've ever seen.... No emergency exits so not for the claustrophobic or faint hearted",
          "Safe and fun and free, going under the tunnel was something we enjoyed more than we thought. A place where your kids can run through and the wooden stairs are historical.",
          "The tunnel must have been a small miracle when is was built in the thirties before the second world war. You can enter it through a building (pictured) on the St. Jansvliet that has original escalators and an elevator for bicycles, although many cyclists just take their bikes on",
          "We used the tunnel becuase we wanted a photo / view of the city. We thought it was just a subway and were surprised to find that it was built in the 1930's, had original wooden escalators and was 0.5km long! The view of the city was good, but the view was not spectacular. We"

        "wiki": "Antwerp ( (listen); Dutch: Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen); French: Anvers [\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281s] (listen)) is a city in Belgium and the capital of Antwerp province in the Flemish Region. With a population of 520,504, it is the most populous city proper in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people, it is the second largest metropolitan region after Brussels.Antwerp is on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe and within the top 20 globally. The city is also known for its diamond industry and trade.\nBoth economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt. Antwerp was also the place of the world's oldest stock exchange building, originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872.The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren (Dutch pronunciation: [s\u026a\u0272\u02c8jo\u02d0r\u0259(n)]), after the Spanish honorific se\u00f1or or French seigneur, \"lord\", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century. The city hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is New Latin.A Germanic (Frankish or Frisian) origin could contain prefix anda (\u201cagainst\u201d) and a noun derived from the verb werpen (\u201cto throw\u201d) and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit; a mound (like a terp) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf. If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean \"those who live on both banks\".There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river. He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt.\n\n\n=== Pre-1500 ===\nHistorical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952\u20131961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. The earliest mention of Antwerp dates from the 4th century.\nIn the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks.The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II, a border province facing the County of Flanders.\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon,  was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nAfter the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant, grew in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly enslaved Africans as the century progressed. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544\u20131574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became \"the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height.\" Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the \"Age of Exploration\". During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps.  Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas\".\n\nWithout a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venetian Republic, Republic of Ragusa, Spain and Portugal.  Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \"To the merchants of all nations.\" Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers.  In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth.  Numerous financial bankruptcies  began around 1557. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nThe religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries. The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury: 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over \u00a32 million sterling of damage was done.\n\n\n=== Dutch revolt ===\nSubsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa, and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock) and an access- lock and mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.\n\nIn 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chass\u00e9. For a time Chass\u00e9 subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass\u00e9 made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi)  from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAntwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During World War I, the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Li\u00e8ge. The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.\nAntwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. \nDuring World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote, V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic) Orthodox Judaism.\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into nine entities (districts):\n\nAntwerp\nBerchem\nBerendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo\nBorgerhout\nDeurne\nEkeren\nHoboken\nMerksem\nWilrijkIn 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp, the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.\n\n\n== Buildings and landmarks ==\n\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was noted for the wealth of its citizens (\"Antwerpia nummis\"). The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the Hanseatic League on the northern quays, in 1891. During World War II, the city also suffered considerable damage from V-bombs, and in recent years, other noteworthy buildings have been demolished for new developments.\n\nAntwerp Zoo opened in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the world.\nAntwerp City Hall dates from 1565, and is built primarily in Renaissance style.\nAntwerp Central Station is a railway station designed by Louis Delacenserie which was completed in 1905.\nCathedral of Our Lady. This church was begun in the 14th century and finished in 1518. The church has four works by Rubens, viz. \"The Descent from the Cross\", \"The Elevation of the Cross\", \"The Resurrection of Christ\" and \"The Assumption\"\nSt. James' Church, is more ornate than the cathedral. It contains the remains of numerous famous nobles, among them a major part of the family of Rubens.\nThe Church of St. Paul has a baroque interior. It is a few hundred yards north of the Grote Markt\nSt. Andrew's Church\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church\nMuseum Vleeshuis (Butchers' Hall) is a fine Gothic brick-built building, situated a short distance to the North-West of the Grote Markt.\nPlantin-Moretus Museum preserves the house of the printer Christoffel Plantijn and his successor Jan Moretus\nThe Saint-Boniface Church is an Anglican church and headseat of the archdeanery North-West Europe.\nBoerentoren (Farmers' Tower) or KBC Tower, a 26-storey building built in 1932, is the oldest skyscraper in Europe. It is the tallest building in Antwerp and the second tallest structure after the Cathedral of our Lady. The building was designed by Emiel van Averbeke, R. Van Hoenacker and Jos Smolderen.\nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts\nMuseum Mayer van den Bergh, with works from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nRubenshuis is the former home and studio of Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) in Antwerp. It is now a museum.\nRockox House is the former 17th-century Residence of Nicolaas II Rockox, lord Mayor of Antwerp.\nBourse of Antwerp. Originally built 1531; extensively restored 1872; now Antwerp Trade Fair.\nPalace of Justice, designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006. This building is the antithesis of the heavy, dark court building, designed by Joseph Poelaert, which dominates the skyline of Brussels. The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built on the site of the old Zuid (\"South\") station, at the end of a magnificent 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12). The building's highest 'sail' is 51 m (167 ft) high, has a floor area of 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft), and cost \u20ac130 million.\nZurenborg, a late-19th-century Belle \u00c9poque neighbourhood, on the border of Antwerp and Berchem, with many Art Nouveau architectural elements. The area counts as one of the most original Belle \u00c9poque urban expansion areas in Europe.\nMuseum aan de Stroom\nDen Botaniek or Antwerp's Botanical Garden, created in 1825. Located in the city centre, at the Leopoldstraat, it covers an area of almost 1 hectare.\nHarmonium Art museuM, a museum on pump organs in Klein-Willebroek\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (M HKA)\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\n\nAlthough Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former enceinte, only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. A replica of a castle named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais in the 19th century.\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:\n\n10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch\n12th and 13th century: canals (so called \"vlieten\" and \"ruien\") were made\n16th century: Spanish fortifications\n19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications\n20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\nThis is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.\n\n\n=== Minorities ===\nIn 2010, 36% to 39% of the inhabitants of Antwerp had a migrant background. A study projects that in 2020, 55% of the population will be of migrant background.\n\n\n==== Jewish community ====\n\nAfter The Holocaust and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic, live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff  (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk, based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Ger, Skver, Klausenburg, Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\n==== Jain community ====\n\nThe Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business. Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds. A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk).  Mr Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a full-fledged member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nThere are significant Armenian communities that reside in Antwerp, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with a smaller numbers are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church.\nOne of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel and involved in is the diamond trade business, that based primarily in the diamond district. Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nAccording to the American Association of Port Authorities, the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014\u20132020.  The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.\n\n\n=== Diamonds ===\nAntwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion. The city has four diamond bourses: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers. Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian and Maronite Christian from Lebanon and Armenian, traders become increasingly important.Antwerp World Diamond Centre, (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry. However, in recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nA six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to Brussels, Hasselt and Li\u00e8ge, Ghent, Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"Oosterweelconnection\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to Amsterdam and Paris, and national trains to Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Brussels, Charleroi, Hasselt, Li\u00e8ge, Leuven and Turnhout.\nAntwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald's haunting novel Austerlitz. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"premetro\" and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nA small airport, Antwerp International Airport, is located in the district of Deurne, with passenger service to various European destinations. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre.\nThe now defunct VLM Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport. This office is also CityJet's Antwerp office. When VG Airlines (Delsey Airlines) existed, its head office was located in the district of Merksem.Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport, is about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.\nThere is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs twice every hour on working days.\nThe runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.\nIn September 2019 Air Antwerp began operations with their first route to London City Airport with old VLM Airlines Fokker 50's.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections.\nThe current majority consists of N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld, led by mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA).\n\n\n=== Former mayors ===\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century important mayors include Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Nicolaas II Rockox.\nIn the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti\u00e8ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (New Flemish Alliance).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntwerp has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) similar to that of Southern England, while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) average highs for both July and August. Winters are more dominated by the maritime currents instead, with temps being heavily moderated.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAntwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its school of painting, which included Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the Teniers and many others.\n\nInformally, most Antverpians (in Dutch Antwerpenaren, people from Antwerp) speak Antverpian daily (in Dutch Antwerps), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other Brabantic dialects for its characteristic pronunciation of vowels: an 'aw' sound approximately like that in 'bore' is used for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the 'a' in 'hat'. The Echt Antwaarps Teater (\"Authentic Antverpian Theatre\") brings the dialect on stage.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nAntwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in the world. It has served as the learning centre for many Belgian fashion designers. Since the 1980s, several graduates of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts have become internationally successful fashion designers in Antwerp. The city has had a huge influence on other Belgian fashion designers such as Raf Simons, Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Theyskens and Kris Van Assche.\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nAntwerp is famous for its local products. In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally \"Antwerp Hands\". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.\n\n\n=== Missions to seafarers ===\nA number of Christian missions to seafarers are based in Antwerp, notably on the Itali\u00eblei. These include the Mission to Seafarers, British & International Sailors' Society, the Finnish Seamen's Mission, the Norwegian Sj\u00f8mannskirken and the Apostleship of the Sea. They provide cafeterias, cultural and social activities as well as religious services.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAntwerp is the home of the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC), founded in 1938 and located on the square Grote Markt since 1994.The band dEUS was formed in 1991 in Antwerp. dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material. Their musical influences range from folk and punk to jazz and progressive rock.\n\n\n=== Music festivals ===\nCultuurmarkt van Vlaanderen is a musical festival and a touristic attraction that takes place annually on the final Sunday of August in the city center of Antwerp. Where international and local musicians and actors, present their stage and street performances.Linkerwoofer is a pop-rock music festival located at the left bank of the Scheldt. This music festival starts in August and mostly local Belgian musicians play and perform in this event.Other popular festivals Fire Is Gold, and focuses more on urban music, and Summerfestival.\n\n\n=== World Choir Games ===\nThe city of Antwerp will co-host the 2020 World Choir Games together with the city of Ghent. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAntwerp held the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were the first games after the First World War and also the only ones to be held in Belgium. The road cycling events took place in the streets of the city.Royal Antwerp F.C., currently playing in the Belgian First Division, were founded in 1880 and is known as 'The Great Old' for being the first club registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1895. Since 1998, the club has taken Manchester United players on loan in an official partnership. Another club in the city was Beerschot VAC, founded in 1899 by former Royal Antwerp players. They played at the Olympisch Stadion, the main venue of the 1920 Olympics. Nowadays KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk plays at the Olympisch Stadion in the Belgian Second Division.\nThe Antwerp Giants play in Basketball League Belgium and Topvolley Antwerpen play in the Belgium men's volleyball League.\nFor the year 2013, Antwerp was awarded the title of European Capital of Sport.\nAntwerp hosted the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nAntwerp hosted the start of stage 3 of the 2015 Tour de France on 6 July 2015.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\nAntwerp has a university and several colleges. The University of Antwerp  (Universiteit Antwerpen) was established in 2003, following the merger of the RUCA, UFSIA and UIA institutes. Their roots go back to 1852. The University has approximately 23,000 registered students, making it the third-largest university in Flanders, as well as 1,800 foreign students. It has 7 faculties, spread over four campus locations in the city centre and in the south of the city.\nThe city has several colleges, including Antwerp Management School (AMS), Charlemagne University College (Karel de Grote Hogeschool), Plantin University College (Plantijn Hogeschool), and Artesis University College (Artesis Hogeschool). Artesis University College has about 8,600 students and 1,600 staff, and Charlemagne University College has about 10,000 students and 1,300 staff. Plantin University College has approximately 3,700 students.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nThe following places are twinned with or sister cities to Antwerp:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Born in Antwerp ===\n\n\n=== Lived in Antwerp ===\n\n\n== Select neighbourhoods ==\nDen Dam \u2013 an area in northern Antwerp\nThe diamond district \u2013 an area consisting of several square blocks, it is Antwerp's centre for the cutting, polishing, and trading of diamonds\nLinkeroever \u2013 Antwerp on the left bank of the Scheldt with a lot of apartment buildings\nMeir \u2013 Antwerp's largest shopping street\nVan Wesenbekestraat \u2013 the city's Chinatown\nHet Zuid \u2013 the south of Antwerp, notable for its museums and Expo grounds\nZurenborg \u2013 an area between Central and Berchem station with a concentration of Art Nouveau townhouses\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntwerp Book Fair\nAntwerp lace\nAntwerp Water Works (AWW)\nJewish Community of Antwerp\nLetterenhuis\nList of mayors of Antwerp\nPshevorsk \u2013 Hassidic Jewish movement based in Antwerp\nRoyal Antwerp F.C., local football club\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nBlanchard, Ian.

          "As a youngster, this park was considered a no-go zone, especially at night and I hadn't laid eyes on it in over 25 years. I must say it had a relaxed feel when visiting it recently although it is in need of some TLC. Lots of joggers and some families made it feel",
          "This park lacks appeal and is not in good condition. The walking paths are fine, but the park does not have much else that would justify a visit, especially if one is short of time.",
          "Antwerp Central Park is nice and green, and reasonably quiet, and just 5 minutes from most major streets and the Central Train Station. An accessible park to unwind during the day.",
          "We walked by this park once on our way to another site. Not very inviting and probably not ideal as a detour either, depending on your circumstances. There are much better parks in the city you should rather visit.",
          "This small park used to be special to me because my father took me there sometimes when I was little. Recently it has lost all of its glory because of all the building activity inside and outside the park . Poorly maintained, dirty and muddy when it rains; the pond has totally",
          "The location is good, in the middle of the city center. But the park has lost lots of its charm when the pond was completely drained. There are huge road works going on nearby and it caused a giant leak, which caused all the water to seep away. It looks a bit dystopian and",
          "North part of the park is closed off for works on a new gazebo for more than a year. Maintenance is miserable. Dirty, bunch of deserted ponds, kids playground is falling into disrepair. So not only would I not advise visiting it, you can barely pass through parts of it either",
          "It is not a huge park, it wasn\u2019t that clean either and a bit muddy, so not the place to be now in March. The water was gone, not sure why, but maybe on a hot summer day it is nicer to be here... it has a nice playground, but overall even in its best state I can\u2019t see it as more",
          "Stadspark is small but has a lot of trees and bushes. It also has a \"lake\" with lots of birds making it their home. There are rabbits running around too. If you are near the middle of the park you will not hear the cars that are outside the park. There are benches where people",
          "A great park, located few kms away from the Antwerpen station. Great for a walk, some alone time or to spend time with family. During winter, looks like a fairy tale!",
          "MY \"go-to\" park for a walk, evening run and picnic. Located in the heart of the city. Lovely place to go with family and friends. You will see duck, swan and rabbit around too. Dog friendly, child friendly, happy place to go and see.",
          "It is always very relaxing to walk in the Stadspark. It is nice to see all the birds, the swans and the rabbits running around. It is a nice place for people of all ages, children can play and since the fences near the water have been opened it is also nice to picnic or just",
          "Similar to a lot of innercity parks. Quite a peaceful place to visit, and fairly practical. Lots of things to do, and also good to simply just wander around. Doesn't take too much time out of your trip.",
          "All the usual park facilities. The play area looked reasonable. A river runs through it and a good number of birds.",

          "Good open grass areas and some big ponds for walking / picnics / running. Well designed with lots of trees and bushes around the perimeter help make it not feel like there is as much traffic nearby as is the case.",
          "Not a huge amount to see or do, but if you want somewhere to sit and relax for a couple of minutes, I guess you could do worse.",
          "Since I had 3 days in the city, I took a bike tour around Stadspark. Yes you can bike in it (or at least I didn't see any signs that it's not allowed) and it's a great way to take a small break during your Antwerp city tour. Do not except to see anything special in there, just",
          "Tall trees. Water. Grass. Somewhere to throw back your head and relax in the sunshine. Now that's a great place for lunch from work. Was entirely unexpected from a rather dour city scape",

          "It is definitely not the best or cleanest park in Antwerp but its location, right in the city center not far from central station makes it a great location for a jog or simply a walk with your kids/friends/dog. Great fun when it has snowed....",
          "This nice park is conveniently located near the city center. it is a nice spot to relax for a spell.",
          "Nice park in the city center, not so big, but enough to have a little walk or run before or after work.",
          "When compared to other parks in Antwerpen (or in other European cities) it was quite unclean and not as nice to visit. There were some playgrounds for the children but nothing special.",

          "This really is just a park, not interesting to go to. And after sunset: stay out!!! unless you are looking for man-to-man contact or looking for getting your purse snatched.",
          "Comparing to other parks in cities in Europe, this park is okay, but nothing exceptional. There are trees, water and a playground for children. However, no extra effort has been done to make it worth a special visit.",
          "Because the many new buildings the lake has almost no water anymore. But there's a play garden for children and young people can enjoy theme self in a skatepark. Never go in the park after dark because there are criminals robbing people. This is also the place where you can meet",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Sterckshof castle is in Deurne, Antwerp, Belgium.  It houses the Sterckshof silver museum of the Province of Antwerp.\nBuilt on the site of a much older castle, or great house, the present building is a reconstruction erected in the 1920s. \n\n\n== History ==\nSterckshof is about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) east of the center of Antwerp.\nIt is situated at an altitude of 3 metres (9.8 ft) above sea level.\nFrom as early as the 13th century the site of the castle was occupied by the fortified \"Hooftvunder\" farmhouse, surrounded by a moat.  \nIt was probably used to defend a nearby wooden bridge over the Grote Schijn River.In 1523 it was described as a farm with a house, brewery, moat, ponds, fishery, etc. That year it purchased by Gerard Sterck, \nwho erected up picturesque buildings with a castle, towers and turrets, and called it Sterckhof, a name it retains today. Gerards grandson was Guillaume de Berghes, bishop of Antwerp.\nIn Sterck's monument in Antwerp cathedral he is described as a knight, and lord of Busquoy, Wyneghem, Casterl\u00e9 and Hooft-Vundere.\nSterck was a merchant, banker and secret adviser of the Emperor Charles V.\nAnother owner, Jacob Edelheer, furnished the castle with art collections and scientific collections.Unlike other castles in Antwerp, the Sterckshof was not destroyed during the wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, \nbut it was neglected during a dispute between the heirs after the owner, Jacob van Lemens, died childless in 1664. \nFrom 1693 Sterckshof was owned by the Jesuits of Lier, but the castle was damaged or allowed to deteriorate during the war of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748). After the dissolution of the Jesuit Order, the estate was sold in 1776 to the banker Jan Baptist Cogels, who merged it with his Ter Rivieren estate. \nBy the 1880s the buildings, long uninhabited, were no more than ruins.\n\n\n== Owned by the province ==\nIn 1921 the Province of Antwerp bought the Ter Rivieren estate, with the Sterckshof castle, to make it into the current Rivierenhof park. \nOf the Sterckshof all that was standing was the floor of a tower, the entrance gate and some ramshackle outbuildings. \nIn 1922 the architect JA Van der Gucht submitted plans for reconstruction. \nUsing old pictures and archaeological discoveries, in the 1930s the building rose as an evocative reconstruction.\nThe reconstructed building with its red brick turrets and courtyards is set in formal gardens surrounded by a moat,\nconveying an impression of the houses of the wealthy in the 16th century.The municipality of Deurne declined to use the building for their town hall.\nIn 1926 the idea of using it for the province's technical department was explored but rejected since the  building was not suitable. The idea of using it for a dairy was also rejected. Eventually, in 1934 an Association was founded to established a Museum of Flemish Civilization. The Sterckshof was transferred to the association on 21 May 1938 and it was immediately opened to the public. Joseph De Beer, the honorary curator, moved into the house and began acquiring what became a huge and disparate collection of archaeological, natural history, ethnology and art and crafts objects.From 1951 the state began funding the museum. When De Beer died in February 1953 the original association was liquidated and the castle was taken over by the Province of Antwerp. At first it housed the Province's Sterckshof Museum of Art Crafts, and later the Province's Sterckshof silver museum. The museum's displays covered techniques for working the metal and domestic and religious uses. It also included a silversmith's workshop. The museum exhibited Belgian silver and pewter wares from the 16th to 21st centuries, and also some fine antique furnishings. The museum was unable to expand on the site due to planning restrictions, so was closed in 2014 and merged with the Antwerp Diamond Museum to create the DIVA Museum for Diamonds, Jewellery and Silver, located in Antwerp city centre.After the silver museum moved out, the province put the castle on the market, with an asking price of 4.5 million euros; in 2017 the Flemish government approved 2 million euros in renovation subsidies to sweeten the offer. As of August 2019 a buyer had still not been found.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nSources",

        "wiki": "A lock is a device used for raising and lowering boats, ships and other watercraft between stretches of water of different levels on river and canal waterways. The distinguishing feature of a lock is a fixed chamber in which the water level can be varied; whereas in a caisson lock, a boat lift, or on a canal inclined plane, it is the chamber itself (usually then called a caisson) that rises and falls.\nLocks are used to make a river more easily navigable, or to allow a canal to cross land that is not level. Later canals used more and larger locks to allow a more direct route to be taken.\nSince 2016, the largest lock worldwide is the Kieldrecht Lock in the Port of Antwerp, Belgium.\n\n\n== Pound lock ==\n\nA pound lock is a type of lock that is used almost exclusively nowadays on canals and rivers. A pound lock has a chamber with gates at both ends that control the level of water in the pound. In contrast, an earlier design with a single gate was known as a flash lock.\nPound locks were first used in medieval China during the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279 AD), having been pioneered by the Song politician and naval engineer Qiao Weiyue in 984. They replaced earlier double slipways that had caused trouble and are mentioned by the Chinese polymath Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095) in his book Dream Pool Essays (published in 1088), and fully described in the Chinese historical text Song Shi (compiled in 1345):\n\nThe distance between the two locks was rather more than 50 paces, and the whole space was covered with a great roof like a shed. The gates were 'hanging gates'; when they were closed the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out.\n\nThe water level could differ by 4 feet (1.2 m) or 5 feet (1.5 m) at each lock and in the Grand Canal the level was raised in this way by 138 feet (42 m).In medieval Europe a sort of pound lock was built in 1373 at Vreeswijk, Netherlands. This pound lock serviced many ships at once in a large basin. Yet the first true pound lock was built in 1396 at Damme near Bruges, Belgium. The Italian Bertola da Novate (c. 1410\u20131475) constructed 18 pound locks on the Naviglio di Bereguardo (part of the Milan canal system sponsored by Francesco Sforza) between 1452 and 1458.\n\n\n== Use in river navigation ==\n\nWhen a stretch of river is made navigable, a lock is sometimes required to bypass an obstruction such as a rapid, dam, or mill weir \u2013 because of the change in river level across the obstacle.\nIn large scale river navigation improvements, weirs and locks are used together. A weir will increase the depth of a shallow stretch, and the required lock will either be built in a gap in the weir, or at the downstream end of an artificial cut which bypasses the weir and perhaps a shallow stretch of river below it. A river improved by these means is often called a Waterway or River Navigation (see example Calder and Hebble Navigation).\nSometimes a river is made entirely non-tidal by constructing a sea lock directly into the estuary.\nIn more advanced river navigations, more locks are required.\n\nWhere a longer cut bypasses a circuitous stretch of river, the upstream end of the cut will often be protected by a flood lock.\nThe longer the cut, the greater the difference in river level between start and end of the cut, so that a very long cut will need additional locks along its length. At this point, the cut is, in effect, a canal.\n\n\n== Use in canals ==\n\nEarly completely artificial canals, across fairly flat countryside, would get round a small hill or depression by simply detouring (contouring) around it. As engineers became more ambitious in the types of country they felt they could overcome, locks became essential to effect the necessary changes in water level without detours that would be completely uneconomic both in building costs and journey time. Later still, as construction techniques improved, engineers became more willing to cut directly through and across obstacles by constructing long tunnels, cuttings, aqueducts or embankments, or to construct even more technical devices such as inclined planes or boat lifts. However, locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions, and are an essential part of even the most modern navigable waterways.\n\n\n== Basic construction and operation ==\n\nAll pound locks have three elements:\n\nA watertight chamber connecting the upper and lower canals, and large enough to enclose one or more boats. The position of the chamber is fixed, but its water level can vary.\nA gate (often a pair of \"pointing\" half-gates) at each end of the chamber. A gate is opened to allow a boat to enter or leave the chamber; when closed, the gate is watertight.\nA set of lock gear to empty or fill the chamber as required. This is usually a simple valve (traditionally, a flat panel (paddle) lifted by manually winding a rack and pinion mechanism) which allows water to drain into or out of the chamber; larger locks may use pumps.The principle of operating a lock is simple. For instance, if a boat travelling downstream finds the lock already full of water:\n\nThe entrance gates are opened and the boat moves in.\nThe entrance gates are closed.\nA valve is opened, this lowers the boat by draining water from the chamber.\nThe exit gates are opened and the boat moves out.If the lock were empty, the boat would have had to wait 5 to 10 minutes while the lock was filled. For a boat travelling upstream, the process is reversed; the boat enters the empty lock, and then the chamber is filled by opening a valve that allows water to enter the chamber from the upper level. The whole operation will usually take between 10 and 20 minutes, depending on the size of the lock and whether the water in the lock was originally set at the boat's level.\nBoaters approaching a lock are usually pleased to meet another boat coming towards them, because this boat will have just exited the lock on their level and therefore set the lock in their favour \u2013 saving about 5 to 10 minutes. However, this is not true for staircase locks, where it is quicker for boats to go through in convoy.\n\n\n== Details and terminology ==\n\nFor simplicity, this section describes a basic type of lock, with a pair of gates at each end of the chamber and simple rack and pinion paddles raised manually by means of a detachable windlass operated by lock-keepers or the boat's shore crew. This type can be found all over the world, but the terminology here is that used on the British canals. A subsequent section explains common variations.\n\n\n=== Rise ===\nThe rise is the change in water-level in the lock. The two deepest locks on the English canal system are Bath deep lock on the Kennet and Avon Canal and Tuel Lane Lock on the Rochdale Canal, which both have a rise of nearly 20 feet (6.1 m). Both locks are amalgamations of two separate locks, which were combined when the canals were restored to accommodate changes in road crossings. The deepest \"as-built\" locks in England are considered to be Etruria Top Lock on the Trent and Mersey Canal and Somerton Deep Lock on the Oxford Canal: both have a rise of about 14 ft (4.3 m). Again, sources vary as to which is the deepest, and in any case Etruria has been deepened over the years to accommodate subsidence. By comparison, the Carrapatelo and Valeira locks on the Douro river in Portugal, which are 279 feet (85 m) long and 39 feet (12 m) wide, have maximum lifts of 115 feet (35 m) and 108 feet (33 m) respectively. The two Ardnacrusha locks near Limerick on the Shannon navigation in Ireland have a rise of 100 feet (30 m). The upper chamber rises 60 feet (18 m) and is connected to the lower chamber by a tunnel, which when descending does not become visible until the chamber is nearly empty.\n\n\n=== Pound ===\nA pound is the level stretch of water between two locks (also known as a reach). On American canals, a pound is called a level.\n\n\n=== Chamber ===\nThe chamber is the main feature of a lock. It is a watertight (masonry, brick, steel or concrete) enclosure which can be sealed off from the pounds at both ends by means of gates. The chamber may be the same size (plus a little manoeuvring room) as the largest vessel for which the waterway was designed; sometimes larger, to allow more than one such vessel at a time to use the lock. The chamber is said to be \"full\" when the water level is the same as in the upper pound; and \"empty\" when the level is the same as in the lower pound. (If the lock has no water in it at all, perhaps for maintenance work, it might also be said to be empty, but it is more usually described as \"drained\" or \"de-watered\".)\n\n\n=== Cill ===\nThe cill, also spelled sill, is a narrow horizontal ledge protruding a short way into the chamber from below the upper gates. Allowing the rear of the boat to \"hang\" on the cill is the main danger when descending a lock, and the position of the forward edge of the cill is usually marked on the lock side by a white line. The edge of the cill is usually curved, protruding less in the center than at the edges. In some locks, there is a piece of oak about 9 in (23 cm) thick which protects the solid part of the lock cill. On the Oxford Canal it is called a babbie; on the Grand Union Canal it is referred to as the cill bumper. Some canal operation authorities, primarily in the United States and Canada, call the ledge a miter sill (mitre sill in Canada).\n\n\n==== Photo gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Gates ===\nGates are the watertight doors which seal off the chamber from the upper and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the lower gate has to be able to seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.\n\n\n=== Balance beam ===\nA balance beam is the long arm projecting from the landward side of the gate over the towpath. As well as providing leverage to open and close the heavy gate, the beam also balances the (non-floating) weight of the gate in its socket, and so allows the gate to swing more freely.\n\n\n=== Paddle ===\nA paddle \u2013 sometimes known as a slacker, clough, or (in American English) wicket \u2013 is the simple valve by which the lock chamber is filled or emptied. The paddle itself is a sliding wooden (or nowadays plastic) panel which when \"lifted\" (slid up) out of the way allows water to either enter the chamber from the upper pound or flow out to the lower pound. A gate paddle simply covers a hole in the lower part of a gate; a more sophisticated ground paddle blocks an underground culvert. There can be up to 8 paddles (two gate paddles and two ground paddles at both upper and lower ends of the chamber) but there will often be fewer. For a long period since the 1970s it was British Waterways policy not to provide gate paddles in replacement top gates if two ground paddles existed. The reason for this was given as safety, since it is possible for an ascending boat to be swamped by the water from a carelessly lifted gate paddle. However, without the gate paddles the locks are slower to operate and this has been blamed in some places for causing congestion. Since the late 1990s the preferred method has been to retain or re-install the gate paddles and fit 'baffles' across them to minimise the risk of inundation.\nOn the old Erie Canal, there was a danger of injury when operating the paddles: water, on reaching a certain position, would push the paddles with a force which could tear the windlass (or handle) out of one's hands, or if one was standing in the wrong place, could knock one into the canal, leading to injuries and drownings.\n\n\n=== Winding gear or paddle gear ===\nWinding gear is the mechanism which allows paddles to be lifted (opened) or lowered (closed). Typically, a square-section stub emerges from the housing of the winding gear. This is the axle of a sprocket (\"pinion\") which engages with a toothed bar (\"rack\") attached by rodding to the top of the paddle. A lock-keeper or member of the boat's shore crew engages the square socket of their windlass (see below) onto the end of the axle and turns the windlass perhaps a dozen times. This rotates the pinion and lifts the paddle. A pawl engages with the rack to prevent the paddle from dropping inadvertently while being raised, and to keep it raised when the windlass is removed, so that the operator can attend to other paddles. Nowadays it is considered discourteous and wasteful of water to leave a paddle open after a boat has left the lock, but in commercial days it was normal practice. To lower a paddle the pawl must be disengaged and the paddle wound down with the windlass. Dropping paddles by knocking the pawl off can cause damage to the mechanism; the paddle gear is typically made of cast iron and can shatter or crack when dropped from a height. In areas where water-wastage due to vandalism is a problem, (for example the Birmingham Canal Navigations), paddle mechanisms are commonly fitted with vandal-proof locks (nowadays rebranded \"water conservation devices\") which require the boater to employ a key before the paddle can be lifted. The keys are officially known as \"water conservation keys\", but boaters usually refer to them as T-keys, from their shape; handcuff keys because the original locks, fitted on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, resembled handcuffs; Leeds and Liverpool Keys after that canal; or simply Anti-Vandal Keys.\n\n\n=== Hydraulic paddle gear ===\nDuring the 1980s, British Waterways began to introduce a hydraulic system for operating paddles, especially those on bottom gates, which are the heaviest to operate. A metal cylinder about a foot in diameter was mounted on the balance beam and contained a small oil-operated hydraulic pump. A spindle protruded from the front face and was operated by a windlass in the usual way, the energy being transferred to the actual paddle by small bore pipes. The system was widely installed and on some canals it became very common. There turned out to be two serious drawbacks. It was much more expensive to install and maintain than traditional gear and went wrong more frequently, especially once vandals learned to cut the pipes. Even worse, it had a safety defect, in that the paddle once in the raised position could not be dropped in an emergency, but had to be wound down, taking a good deal longer. These factors led to the abandonment of the policy in the late 1990s, but examples of it survive all over the system, as it is usually not removed until the gates need replacing, which happens about every twenty years.\n\n\n=== Windlass (\"lock key\") ===\n\nA windlass (also variously 'lock handle', 'iron' or simply 'key') is a detachable crank used for opening lock paddles (the word does not refer to the winding mechanism itself).\nThe simplest windlass is made from an iron rod of circular section, about half an inch in diameter and two feet long, bent to make an L-shape with legs of slightly different length. The shorter leg is called the handle, and the longer leg is called the arm. Welded to the end of the arm is a square, sometimes tapered, socket of the correct size to fit onto the spindle protruding from lock winding gear.\n\nSocket: Traditionally, windlasses had a single socket, designed for a particular canal. When undertaking a journey through several canals with different lock-gear spindle sizes it was necessary to carry several different windlasses. A modern windlass usually has two sockets for use on different canals: the smaller is for the British Waterways standard spindle, fitted in the early 1990s almost everywhere, the larger for the gear on the Grand Union Canal north of Napton Junction, which they were unable/unwilling to convert.\nHandle: The handle is long enough for a two-handed grip and is far enough from the socket to give enough leverage to wind the paddle up or down. There may be a freely rotating sleeve around the handle to protect the hands from the friction of rough iron against skin.\nArm: A \"long throw\" windlass has a longer arm so that the handle is further from the socket to give a greater leverage on stiffer paddles. If the throw is too long then the user, winding a gate paddle, risks barking their knuckles against the balance beam when the handle is at the lowest point of its arc. A sophisticated modern windlass may have an adjustable-length arm.\nMaterials : Early windlasses were individually hand forged from a single piece of wrought iron by a blacksmith. More modern techniques include casting of iron or bronze, drop forging and (the most common technique) welding. Some boatmen had their windlasses 'silvered' (or chrome plated) for increased comfort and to prevent rusting. Windlasses are now only rarely plated, but a popular modern choice of metal is aluminium, whose smooth and rustproof surface has the same advantages of longevity and blister-reduction, and is also very light. One type of these, the Dunton Double, has only a single eye, but by clever tapering it will operate either size of spindle.On the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, the lockkeepers were required to remove the windlasses from all lock paddles at night, to prevent unauthorized use.\n\n\n=== \"Turning\" a lock ===\n\"Turning\" a lock can simply mean emptying a full lock, or filling an empty one (\"We entered the lock, and it only took us five minutes to turn it\"). It is used more often to refer to a lock being filled or emptied for the benefit of someone else (\"The lock was turned for us by a boat coming the other way\") and sometimes the opposite (\"The lock was set for us, but the crew of the boat coming the other way turned it before we got there\").\n\n\n=== Swell or swelling ===\nA swell was caused by opening suddenly the paddle valves in the lock gates, or when emptying a lock.\nTo help boats leave (downstream) a lock, the locksman would sometimes open the paddles to create a swell, which would help \"flush\" the boat out of the lock. In one case, a boatsman asked for a back swell, that is, open and shut the paddles a few times to create some waves, to help him get off the bank where he was stuck. If boats ran aground (from being overloaded) they sometimes asked passing crews to tell the upstream lock to give them an extra heavy swell, which consisted of opening all the paddles on the lock gate, creating a surge that affected the whole pound below.On the Erie Canal, some loaded boats needed a swell to get out of the lock, particularly lumber boats, being top heavy, would list to one side and get stuck in the lock, and needed a swell to get them out. Some lockkeepers would give a swell to anyone to help them on the way, but some would ask for money for the swell.The Erie Canal management did not like swelling for two reasons. First, it used too much water lowering the water on the pound above sometimes causing boats to run aground. In addition, it raised the water level on the pound below causing some boats to strike bridges or get stuck.\n\n\n=== \"Lock mooring\" ===\n\"Lock mooring\" was a commonly used method of navigating into a lock by a barge travelling upstream. The barge would be directed to the slack water to one side of the lock gates and as the volume of water decreased as the lock emptied the barge or boat is effectively sucked out of the slack water into the path of the lock gates. The effort required to navigate the barge or boat into the mouth of the lock was therefore substantially reduced.\n\n\n=== Snubbing posts ===\n\nOn horse-drawn and mule-drawn canals, snubbing posts were used to slow or stop a boat in the lock. A 200-ton boat moving at a few miles an hour could destroy the lock gate. To prevent this, a rope was wound around the snubbing post as the boat entered the lock. Pulling on the rope slowed the boat, due to the friction of the rope against the post. A rope 2\u00bd inches (6.3 cm) in diameter and about 60 feet (18 meters) long was typically used on the Erie Canal to snub a boat in a lock.One incident, which took place in June 1873 on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, involved the boat the Henry C. Flagg and its drunk captain. That boat was already leaking; the crew, having partially pumped the water out, entered Lock 74, moving in front of another boat. Because they failed to snub the boat, it crashed into and knocked out the downstream gates. The outrush of water from the lock caused the upstream gates to slam shut, breaking them also, and sending a cascade of water over the boat, sinking it. This suspended navigation on the canal for 48 hours until the lock gates could be replaced and the boat removed from the lock.\n\n\n== Variations ==\n\nVariations exist for types of locks and the terminology used for them.\n\n\n=== Single gates ===\nSingle gates are often installed on narrow canals (locks approx. 7 feet or 2.1 metres wide).\nOn most English narrow canals, the upper end of the chamber is closed by a single gate the full width of the lock. This was cheaper to construct and is quicker to operate with a small crew, as only one gate needs to be opened. These were often fitted with a post allowing a rope to be used to stop the boat and close the gate at the same time.\nSome narrow locks (e.g. on Birmingham Canal Navigations) go even further. They have single gates at the lower end also. This speeds up passage, even though single lower gates are heavy (heavier than a single upper gate, because the lower gate is taller) and the lock has to be longer (a lower gate opens INTO the lock, it has to pass the bow or stern of an enclosed boat, and a single gate has a wider arc than two half-gates).\n\n\n=== Steel gates ===\nSteel gates and/or balance beams are frequently used nowadays, although all-wooden versions are still fitted where appropriate.\n\nSwinging gates. Even very large steel-gated locks still can use essentially the same swinging gate design as small 250-year-old locks on the English canals. On English canals, steel gates usually have wooden mitre posts as this gives a better seal.\nSliding gates. Some low-head locks use sliding steel gates (see Kiel Canal). The sliding gates of the Nieuwe Meersluis in Amsterdam double as roadways.\nCaisson gates. A kind of sliding gate that is hollow and can float. It can be constructed to withstand high heads.\nGuillotine gates. Some locks have vertically moving steel gates \u2013 these are quite common on river navigations in East Anglia. Sometimes just one of the pairs of swinging gates is replaced by a guillotine: for instance at Salterhebble Locks, where space to swing the balance beams of bottom gates of the lowest lock was restricted by bridge widening. On the River Nene most locks have this arrangement as in time of flood the top mitre gates are chained open and the bottom guillotines lifted so that the lock chamber acts as an overflow sluice. Guillotine gates are also used on the downstream side of larger locks such as the 23m Boll\u00e8ne lock on the River Rh\u00f4ne, the aperture being large enough for a boat to travel under it.\nVertically rotating gates (American usage: Drop gates)  are gates which, when open, lie flat on the canal bed and which close by lifting (London Flood Barrier). Some of these were installed on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in the congested 7 Locks area since they could be operated by one man and also could speed up traffic.\nRotating-sector gates. Some of these work very like traditional swinging gates, but with each gate in the form of a sector of a cylinder. They close by rotating out from the lock wall and meeting in the centre of the chamber. Water is let in or out by opening the gates slightly: there may be no paddles or other lock gear. The lock at Limehouse Basin, which gives access to the River Thames, is an example. A dramatically large one can be seen at the Maeslantkering (huge flood gates) near Rotterdam. There is a different type at the sea lock on the Ribble Link: this is a rising sector gate, which has a horizontal axis: the gate drops to the bed of the river to allow boats to pass.\n\n\n=== Different paddle gear ===\nSome manually operated paddles do not require a detachable handle (windlass) because they have their handles ready-attached.\nOn the Leeds and Liverpool Canal there is a variety of different lock gear. Some paddles are raised by turning what is in effect a large horizontal wing nut (butterfly nut) lifting a screw-threaded bar attached to the top of the paddle. Others are operated by lifting a long wooden lever, which operates a wooden plate which seals the culvert. These are known locally as \"jack cloughs\". Bottom gate paddles are sometimes operated by a horizontal ratchet which also slides a wooden plate sideways, rather than the more common vertical lift. Many of these idiosyncratic paddles have been \"modernised\" and they are becoming rare.\nOn the Calder and Hebble Navigation, some paddle gear is operated by repeatedly inserting a Calder and Hebble Handspike (length of 4\" by 2\" hardwood) into a ground-level slotted wheel and pushing down on the handspike to rotate the wheel on its horizontal axis.\nOn some parts of the Montgomery Canal bottom paddles are used in place of side paddles. Rather than passing into the lock through a culvert around the side of the lock gate, the water flows through a culvert in the bottom of the canal. The paddle slides horizontally over the culvert.\n\n\n=== Composite locks ===\nTo economise, especially where good stone would be prohibitively expensive or difficult to obtain, composite locks were made, i.e. they were constructed using rubble or inferior stone, dressing the inside walls of the lock with wood, so as not to abrade the boats. This was done, for instance, on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal with the locks near the Paw Paw Tunnel and also the Chenango Canal Because the wood would swell (making the lock space smaller) or rot away, the wood was often replaced by concrete.\n\n\n=== Lock keepers ===\n\nSome locks are operated (or at least supervised) by professional or volunteer lock keepers. This is particularly true on commercial waterways, or where locks are large or have complicated features that the average leisure boater may not be able to operate successfully. For instance, although the Thames above Teddington (England) is almost entirely a leisure waterway, the locks are usually staffed. Only recently have boaters been allowed limited access to the hydraulic gear to operate the locks when the keeper is not present.\n\n\n=== Powered operation ===\nOn large modern canals, especially very large ones such as ship canals, the gates and paddles are too large to be hand operated, and are operated by hydraulic or electrical equipment. On the Caledonian Canal the lock gates were operated by man-powered capstans, one connected by chains to open the gate and another to draw it closed. By 1968 these had been replaced by hydraulic power acting through steel rams. Even on smaller canals, some gates and paddles are electrically operated, particularly if the lock is regularly staffed by professional lock keepers. On the River Thames below Oxford all the locks are staffed and powered. Powered locks are usually still filled by gravity, though some very large locks use pumps to speed things up.\n\n\n=== Fish ladders ===\nThe construction of locks (or weirs and dams) on rivers obstructs the passage of fish. Some fish such as lampreys, trout and salmon go upstream to spawn. Measures such as a fish ladder are often taken to counteract this. Navigation locks have also potential to be operated as fishways to provide increased access for a range of biota.\n\n\n=== Weigh lock ===\n A weigh lock is a specialized canal lock designed to determine the weight of barges to assess toll payments based upon the weight and value of the cargo carried. The Erie Canal had a weigh locks in Rochester, Syracuse, and West Troy New York. The Lehigh Canal also had weigh locks (see photo on right).\n\n\n== Special cases ==\n\n\n=== Lock flights ===\n\nLoosely, a flight of locks is simply a series of locks in close-enough proximity to be identified as a single group. For many reasons, a flight of locks is preferable to the same number of locks spread more widely: crews are put ashore and picked up once, rather than multiple times; transition involves a concentrated burst of effort, rather than a continually interrupted journey; a lock keeper may be stationed to help crews through the flight quickly; and where water is in short supply, a single pump can recycle water to the top of the whole flight. The need for a flight may be determined purely by the lie of the land, but it is possible to group locks purposely into flights by using cuttings or embankments to \"postpone\" the height change. Examples: Caen Hill locks, Devizes.\n\"Flight\" is not synonymous with \"Staircase\" (see below). A set of locks is only a staircase if successive lock chambers share a gate (i.e. do not have separate top and bottom gates with a pound between them). Most flights are not staircases, because each chamber is a separate lock (with its own upper and lower gates), there is a navigable pound (however short) between each pair of locks, and the locks are operated in the conventional way.\nHowever, some flights include (or consist entirely of) staircases. On the Grand Union (Leicester) Canal, the Watford flight consists of a four-chamber staircase and three separate locks; and the Foxton flight consists entirely of two adjacent 5-chamber staircases.\n\n\n=== Staircase locks ===\n Where a very steep gradient has to be climbed, a lock staircase is used. There are two types of staircase, \"real\" and \"apparent\".\nA \"real\" staircase can be thought of as a \"compressed\" flight, where the intermediate pounds have disappeared, and the upper gate of one lock is also the lower gate of the one above it. However, it is incorrect to use the terms staircase and flight interchangeably: because of the absence of intermediate pounds, operating a staircase is very different from operating a flight. It can be more useful to think of a staircase as a single lock with intermediate levels (the top gate is a normal top gate, and the intermediate gates are all as tall as the bottom gate). As there is no intermediate pound, a chamber can only be filled by emptying the one above, or emptied by filling the one below: thus the whole staircase has to be full of water (except for the bottom chamber) before a boat starts to ascend, or empty (except for the top chamber) before a boat starts to descend. By building a pair of such lock sets (one used to climb and the other to descend) these difficulties are avoided, as well as enabling a greater traffic volume and reduced wait times.\nIn an \"apparent\" staircase the chambers still have common gates, but the water does not pass directly from one chamber to the next, going instead via side ponds. This means it is not necessary to ensure that the flight is full or empty before starting.\nExamples of famous \"real\" staircases in England are Bingley and Grindley Brook. Two-rise staircases are more common: Snakeholme Lock and Struncheon Hill Lock on the Driffield Navigation were converted to staircase locks after low water levels hindered navigation over the bottom cill at all but the higher tides \u2013 the new bottom chamber rises just far enough to get the boat over the original lock cill. In China, the recently completed Three Gorges Dam includes a double five-step staircase for large ships, and a ship lift for vessels of less than 3000 metric tons. Examples of \"apparent\" staircases are Foxton Locks and Watford Locks on the Leicester Branch of the Grand Union.\n\nOperation of a staircase is more involved than a flight. Inexperienced boaters may find operating staircase locks difficult. The key worries (apart from simply being paralysed with indecision) are either sending down more water than the lower chambers can cope with (flooding the towpath, or sending a wave along the canal) or completely emptying an intermediate chamber (although this shows that a staircase lock can be used as an emergency dry dock). To avoid these mishaps, it is usual to have the whole staircase empty before starting to descend, or full before starting to ascend, apart from the initial chamber.\nOne striking difference in using a staircase of either type (compared with a single lock, or a flight) is the best sequence for letting boats through. In a single lock (or a flight with room for boats to pass) boats should ideally alternate in direction. In a staircase, however, it is quicker for a boat to follow a previous one going in the same direction. Partly for this reason staircase locks such as Grindley Brook, Foxton, Watford and Bratch are supervised by lockkeepers, at least during the main cruising season, they normally try to alternate as many boats up, followed by down as there are chambers in the flight.\nAs with a flight, it is possible on a broad canal for more than one boat to be in a staircase at the same time, but managing this without waste of water requires expertise. On English canals, a staircase of more than two chambers is usually staffed: the lockkeepers at Bingley (looking after both the \"5-rise\" and the \"3-rise\") ensure that there are no untoward events and that boats are moved through as speedily and efficiently as possible. Such expertise permits miracles of boat balletics: boats travelling in opposite directions can pass each other halfway up the staircase by moving sideways around each other; or at peak times, one can have all the chambers full simultaneously with boats travelling in the same direction.\n\n\n=== Doubled, paired or twinned locks ===\n\nLocks can be built side by side on the same waterway. This is variously called doubling, pairing, or twinning. The Panama Canal has three sets of double locks. Doubling gives advantages in speed, avoiding hold-ups at busy times and increasing the chance of a boat finding a lock set in its favour. The Belgian Company SBE Engineering worked on this project. There can also be water savings: the locks may be of different sizes, so that a small boat does not need to empty a large lock; or each lock may be able to act as a side pond (water-saving basin) for the other. In this latter case, the word used is usually \"twinned\": here indicating the possibility of saving water by synchronising the operation of the chambers so that some water from the emptying chamber helps to fill the other. This facility has long been withdrawn on the English canals, although the disused paddle gear can sometimes be seen, as at Hillmorton on the Oxford Canal. Elsewhere they are still in use; a pair of twinned locks has been opened in 2014 on the Dortmund-Ems Canal near M\u00fcnster, Germany.The once-famous staircase at Lockport, New York was also a doubled set of locks. Five twinned locks allowed east- and west-bound boats to climb or descend the 60 feet (18 m) Niagara Escarpment, a considerable engineering feat in the nineteenth century. While Lockport today has two large steel locks, half of the old twin stair acts as an emergency spillway and can still be seen, with the original lock gates having been restored in early 2016.These terms can also (in different places or to different people) mean either a two-chamber staircase  (e.g. Turner Wood Double Locks on the Chesterfield Canal: the same canal has a three-rise staircase called Thorpe Low Treble locks), or just a flight of two locks (as at Thornhill Double Locks on the Calder and Hebble Navigation). Also, \"double lock\" (less often, \"twin lock\") is often used by novices on the English canals to mean a wide (14 ft) lock, presumably because it is \"double\" the width of a narrow lock, and allows two narrow boats going in the same direction to \"double up\". These are properly known as broad locks.\n\n\n=== Stop locks ===\n\nA \"stop\" lock is a (very) low-rise lock built at the junction of two (rival) canals to prevent water from passing between them.\nDuring the competitive years of the English waterways system, an established canal company would often refuse to allow a connection from a newer, adjacent one. This situation created the Worcester Bar in Birmingham, where goods had to be transshipped between boats on rival canals only feet apart.\nWhere a junction was built, either because the older canal company saw an advantage in a connection, or where the new company managed to insert a mandatory connection into its Act of Parliament, then the old company would seek to protect (and even enhance) its water supply. Normally, they would specify that, at the junction, the newer canal must be at a higher level than their existing canal. Even though the drop from the newer to the older canal might only be a few inches, the difference in levels still required a lock \u2013 called a stop lock, because it was to stop water flowing continuously between the newer canal and the older, lower one. The lock would be under the control of the new company, and the gates would, of course, \"point\" uphill - towards the newer canal. This would protect the water supply of the newer canal, but would nevertheless \"donate\" a lockful of water to the older company every time a boat went through. In times of excess water, of course, the lock \"bywash\" would continuously supply water to the lower canal.\nWhen variable conditions meant that a higher water level in the new canal could not be guaranteed, then the older company would also build a stop lock (under its own control, with gates pointing towards its own canal) which could be closed when the new canal was low. This resulted in a sequential pair of locks, with gates pointing in opposite directions: one example was at Hall Green near Kidsgrove, where the southern terminus of the Macclesfield Canal joined the Hall Green Branch of the earlier Trent and Mersey Canal. The four gate stop lock near Kings Norton Junction, between the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal and the Worcester and Birmingham Canal was replaced in 1914 by a pair of guillotine lock gates which stopped the water flow regardless of which canal was higher. These gates have been permanently open since nationalisation.Many stop locks were removed or converted to a single gate after nationalisation in 1948. Hall Green stop lock remains, but as a single lock: the extra lock was removed because the lowering of the T&M's summit pound (to improve Harecastle Tunnel's \"air draught\" \u2013 its free height above the water level) meant that the T&M would always be lower than the Macclesfield. The Hall Green Branch is now considered to be an extension of the Macclesfield Canal, which now meets the T&M at Hardings Wood Junction (just short of the Harecastle Tunnel north portal).\nThe newer canal was not always at a higher level than the one it joined. For instance, there is a very shallow lock at Autherley Junction, where the 1835 Birmingham and Liverpool canal (now part of the Shropshire Union Canal) met the older Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, built in 1772. The Nicholson guide shows that a boater travelling south along the newer canal locks \"up\" before turning north or south onto the older Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal \u2013 so the Shropshire Union Canal gains a small lockful of water each time a boat passes. However, the gain is tiny since the level difference is so small that it is sometimes possible to open both gates at once.\n\n\n=== Round locks ===\n\nThere are several examples where locks have been built to a round plan, with more than two exits from the lock chamber, each serving a different water level. Thus the lock serves both as a way of changing levels and as a junction. The circular plan of the lock allows boats within it to rotate to line up with the appropriate exit gate.\nThe best known example of such a round lock is the Agde Round Lock on the Canal du Midi in France. This serves as a lock on the main line of the canal and allows access to the H\u00e9rault River.A second French round lock can be found in the form of the, now disused, \u00c9cluse des Lorraines, connecting the Canal lat\u00e9ral \u00e0 la Loire with the River Allier.\n\n\n=== Drop locks ===\n\nA drop lock allows a short length of canal to be lowered temporarily while a boat passes under an obstruction such as a low bridge. During canal restoration, a drop lock may be used where it is impractical or prohibitively expensive to remove or raise a structure that was built after the canal was closed (and where re-routing the canal is not possible).\nA drop lock can consist of two conventional lock chambers leading to a sump pound, or a single long chamber incorporating the sump - although the term properly applies only to the second case. As the pounds at either end of the structure are at the same height, the lock can only be emptied either by allowing water to run to waste from the sump to a lower stream or drain, or (less wastefully) by pumping water back up to the canal. Particularly in the two-chamber type, there would be a need for a bypass culvert, to allow water to move along the interrupted pound and so supply locks further down the canal. In the case of the single-chamber type, this can be achieved by keeping the lock full and leaving the gates open while not in use.While the concept has been suggested in a number of cases, the only example in the world of a drop lock that has actually been constructed is at Dalmuir on the Forth and Clyde Canal in Scotland. This lock, of the single chamber type, was incorporated during the restoration of the canal, to allow the replacement of a swing bridge (on a busy A road) by a fixed bridge, and so answer criticisms that the restoration of the canal would cause frequent interruptions of the heavy road traffic. It can be emptied by pumping \u2013 but as this uses a lot of electricity the method used when water supplies are adequate is to drain the lock to a nearby burn.\n\n\n=== Flood locks ===\nA flood lock is to prevent a river from flooding a connected waterway. It is typically installed where a canal leaves a river. At normal river levels, the lock gates are left open, and the height of the canal is allowed to rise and fall with the height of the river.\nHowever, if the river floods beyond a safe limit for the canal, then the gates are closed (and an extra lock created) until the river drops again. Since this is a true lock it is possible for boats to leave the canal for the flooded river despite the difference in water levels (though this is not likely to be wise) or (more sensibly) to allow boats caught out on the flood to gain refuge in the canal.\nNote that if the canal is simply a navigation cut connecting two stretches of the same river, the flood lock will be at the upstream end of the cut (the downstream end will have a conventional lock).\nFlood locks which have been used only as flood gates (see below) are often incapable of reverting to their former purpose without refurbishment. That is, where only outer gates are ever closed (probably because a waterway is not a true commercial one, and therefore there is no financial imperative for a boat to venture out onto a flooded river) inner gates soon suffer from lack of maintenance. A good example is on the Calder and Hebble Navigation, where structures referred to in the boating guides as \"Flood Locks\" are clearly only capable of being used for flood-prevention, not for \"penning\" boats to or from the river in flood.\n\n\n=== Flood gates ===\n\n \nA flood gate or \"stop gate\" is the cheaper equivalent of a flood lock. Only one set of gates exist, and so when the river is higher than the canal, the gates are closed and navigation ceases. These are quite common in the French inland waterways system. Flood gates may also be used to sub-divide long canal pounds or protect, in case of bank collapse, the surrounding area if this is lower than the water level of the canal. They are commonly found at the ends of long embankments and at aqueducts. These gates are often overlooked because they lack balance beams and are only a little higher than normal canal level.\n\n\n=== Bi-directional gates and locks ===\n\nWhere a lock is tidal (i.e. one side of the lock has water whose level varies with the tide) or where a canal meets a river whose level may vary, the water on the tidal or river side (the \"downstream\" side) may rise above the water on the normal \"upper\" side. The \"upstream\" pointing doors will then fail to do their job, and will simply drift open. To prevent water flowing the wrong way through the lock, there will need to be at least one set of gates pointing in the \"wrong\" direction. If it is desirable that boats can use the lock in these circumstances, then there needs to be a full set of gates pointing towards the tidal or river side. The usual method is to have gates pointing in opposite directions at both ends of the chamber (alternatively, the \"paired stop lock\" arrangement of two separate sequential locks pointing in opposite directions would work here \u2013 but would require an extra chamber). If navigation is not required (or impossible) at one \"extreme\" (e.g. allow navigation above mid-tide, but just prevent the canal emptying at low tide) then it is only necessary to have one set of bi-directional gates.\n\nA sea lock is one that connects a canal or river directly with an estuary or ocean. All sea locks are tidal.\n\n\n=== Tidal locks ===\n\nA tidal lock is generally any lock that connects tidal with non-tidal water. This includes a lock between a tidal river and the non-tidal reaches, or between a tidal river and a canal, or a sea lock. However, the term usually refers specifically to a lock whose method of operation is affected by the state of the tide. Examples:\n\nA canal joining a river whose levels are always lower than the canal. All that is needed is an ordinary lock, with the gates pointing up the canal. The lock is used normally so long as the tide is high enough to float boats through the lower gates. If near low tide the lock becomes unusable, then the gates can be barred (and simply become a \"reverse flood gate\", holding water in the canal). This arrangement also applies to some sea locks (e.g. Bude Canal).\nA canal joining a river which is normally below it, but which can rise above it (at very high tides, or after heavy rain). One pair of gates can be made bidirectional, i.e. the inward-pointing gates would be supplemented by a pair pointing out to the river. When the river is higher than the canal, the normal gates would just drift open, but the additional pair of gates can be closed to protect the canal, and prevent navigation to the river. In effect, we have simply added a flood gate.\nAs above, but where it is safe to navigate even when the river is higher than the canal. The lock will be fully bidirectional (two pairs of oppositely pointing gates at each end) to allow boats to pass at any normal river levels. At extreme low or high tides unsuitable for navigation, the appropriate sets of gates are barred to prevent passage.\n\n\n=== Inlet Locks ===\n\nAn inlet lock is to regulate water from a feeder canal or a river into the main canal. In some cases, the inlet lock may double as a lift lock to allow boats into the river slackwater. Note that in the example on the right, the feeder canal was originally George Washington's Little Falls Skirting Canal which was part of the Potomac Company's canals, later re-purposed as a feeder canal for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.\n\n\n=== Very large locks ===\n\nThe world's largest lock was, until 2016, the Berendrecht Lock, giving access to the Port of Antwerp in Belgium. In 2016 the Kieldrecht Lock in the same port became the largest. The lock is 500 m (1,600 ft) long, and 68 m (223 ft) wide and drops 17.8 m (58 ft), and has four sliding lock gates. The size of locks cannot be compared without considering the difference in water level that they are designed to operate under. For example, the Boll\u00e8ne lock on the River Rh\u00f4ne has a fall of at least 23 m (75 ft), the Leerstetten, Eckersm\u00fchlen and Hilpoltstein locks on the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal have a fall of 24.67 m (80.9 ft), each and the Oskemen Lock on the Irtysh River in Kazakhstan has a drop of 42 m (138 ft). The total volume of water to be considered in any lock equals the product of its length, breadth and the difference in water levels. Lock staircases are used in an attempt to reduce the total volume of water required in relation to the amount of useful work done. The useful work done relates to the weight of the vessel and the height it is lifted. When a vessel is lowered the consumption of potential energy of the water consumed is considered. An alternative to locks is a boat lift; facilities of this type, e.g. the Anderton boat lift or the Str\u00e9py-Thieu boat lift in Belgium, do not rely on the consumption of water as the primary power source, are powered by motors and are designed to consume a minimum amount of water.\nThe 29 locks on the Mississippi River are typically 600 feet (180 m) long while tug and barge combinations are as much as 1,200 feet (370 m) long consisting of as many as 15 barges and one tug. In these cases, some of the barges are locked through, using partially opened lock valves to create a current to pull the un-powered barges out of the lock where they are tied up to wait for the rest of the barges and the tug to pass through the lock. It can take as much as an hour and a half to pass the lock.\nThe gates of a Guillotine lock work in a way similar to a sluice gate, but most canal lock gates are hinged to swing like doors.\n\n\n==== Hiram M. Chittenden Locks ====\nEvery November, the large lock of the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks (better known locally as the \"Ballard Locks\" in reference to the Seattle neighborhood they are located in) was emptied for maintenance, as seen in the November 2004 pictures below. This provides an opportunity to visualize how a lock works without the water obscuring the bottom of the lock. For reference, the picture far left shows the lock in operation, with a tug and a barge (loaded with sand and gravel) waiting for the gates to open. In the bottom left corner of the picture may be seen the cut-out in the side wall that contains the gate when open.\nThe lock has three pairs of gates, one pair at each end and one pair in the middle so that half the length of the lock can be used when the whole length is not required, thus saving water. The barely visible person walking along the bottom of the lock in the second picture gives an indication of the vast size of this lock. In both pictures of the end gates, the string of penstock openings are visible along the sides at the bottom. The water entering and leaving the lock flows by gravity through these openings. It requires around 15 minutes to fill or empty the lock.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Van gate ===\n\nThis type of gate was a Dutch invention in the early 19th century. The Van gate has the special property that it can open in the direction of high water solely using water pressure. This gate type was primarily used to purposely flood certain regions, for instance in the case of the Hollandic Water Line. Nowadays this type of gate can still be found in a few places, for example in Gouda.\nThe design of a Van gate is shown in the image on the lower right. When the tube connecting the separate chamber with the high water level side of the sluice is closed and the connection with the low water level side opened, the water level in the separate chamber will drop to the level on the low water level side of the sluice. The surface area of the gate separating the chamber from the high water level side of the sluice is larger than that of the gate closing the sluice. This results into a net force that opens up the sluice.\n\n\n== History and development ==\n\n\n=== Dams and weirs ===\nIn ancient times river transport was common, but rivers were often too shallow to carry anything but the smallest boats. Ancient people discovered that rivers could be made to carry larger boats by making dams to raise the water level. The water behind the dam deepened until it spilled over the top creating a weir. The water was then deep enough to carry larger boats. This dam building was repeated along the river, until there were \"steps\" of deep water.\n\n\n=== Flash locks ===\n\nThe development of dams and weirs created the problem of how to get the boats between these \"steps\" of water. An early and crude way of doing this was by a flash lock. A flash lock consisted essentially of a small opening in the dam, which could be quickly opened and closed. On the Thames in England, this was closed with vertical posts (known as rymers) against which boards were placed to block the gap.\nWhen the gap was opened, a torrent of water would spill out, carrying a \"downstream\" boat with it, or allowing an \"upstream\" boat to be man hauled or winched through against the flow. When the boat was through, the opening would be quickly closed again. The \"gate\" could also be opened to release a 'flash' downstream to enable grounded boats to get off shoals, hence the name.\nThis system was used extensively in Ancient China and in many other parts of the world. But this method was dangerous, and many boats were sunk by the torrent of water. Since this system necessarily involved lowering the level in the pound, it was not popular with millers who depended on a full head of water to operate their equipment. This led to constant battles, both legal and physical, between the navigation and milling interests, with rivers being closed to navigation if there was any shortage of water. It was mainly this conflict, which led to the adoption of the pound lock in medieval China, as this means that relatively little water is consumed by navigation.\n\n\n=== Staunch ===\nA more sophisticated device was the staunch or water gate, consisting of a gate (or pair of mitred gates) which could be closed and held shut by water pressure when the river was low, to float vessels over upstream shallows at times of low water. However, the whole upstream head of water had to be drained (by some auxiliary method approaching modern sluices) before a boat could pass. Accordingly, they were not used where the obstacle to be passed was a mill weir.\n\n\n=== Pound lock ===\n\nThe natural extension of the staunch was to provide an upper gate (or pair of gates) to form an intermediate \"pound\" which was all that need be emptied when a boat passed through. This type of lock, called a pound lock was known in Imperial China and Europe.Pound locks were first used in medieval China during the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279 AD). The Songshi or History of the Song Dynasty, volume 307, biography 66, records how Qiao Weiyue, a high-ranking tax administrator, was frustrated at the frequent losses incurred when his grain barges were wrecked on the West River near Huai'an in Jiangsu. The soldiers at one double slipway, he discovered, had plotted with bandits to wreck heavy imperial barges so that they could steal the spilled grain. In 984 Qiao installed a pair of sluice-gates two hundred and fifty feet apart, the entire structure roofed over like a building. By siting two staunch gates so close by one another, Qiao had created a short stretch of canal, effectively a pound-lock, filled from the canal above by raising individual wooden baulks in the top gate and emptied into the canal below by lowering baulks in the top gate and raising ones in the lower.\n\n\n=== Turf-sided lock ===\nA turf-sided lock is an early form of canal lock design that uses earth banks to form the lock chamber, subsequently attracting grasses and other vegetation, instead of the now more familiar and widespread brick, stone, or concrete lock wall constructions. This early lock design was most often used on river navigations in the early 18th century before the advent of canals in Britain. The sides of the turf-lock are sloping so, when full, the lock is quite wide. Consequently, this type of lock needs more water to operate than vertical-sided brick- or stone-walled locks. On British canals and waterways most turf-sided locks have been subsequently rebuilt in brick or stone, and so only a few good examples survive, such as at Garston Lock, and Monkey Marsh Lock, on the Kennet and Avon Canal. Both these locks are in the canalised river section of the canal and so are over supplied with water.\n\n\n== Use of water ==\nThe main problem caused by locks is that, each time a lock goes through one fill\u2013empty cycle, a lockful of water (tens of thousands up to millions of litres) is released to the lower pound. In more simplistic terms, on a canal where only one boat will fit into a lock, a boat travelling from the summit pound to the lowest pound is accompanied on its journey by one 'personal' lockful of water. A boat going the other way also transfers a lockful of water from the summit pound to the lowest pound. To prevent the canal from running dry, some method must be used to ensure that the water supply at the canal summit is constantly replenished at the rate that the water is being drained downwards. This is, of course much more of a problem on an artificial canal crossing a watershed than on a river navigation.\n\n\n=== Design ===\nWhen planning a canal, the designer will attempt to build a summit level with a large reservoir, or one supplied by an artificial watercourse from a distant source, or one as long as possible (to act as its own reservoir) or which cuts across as many springs or rivers as possible (or all of these).  Driving the summit level through a deep cutting or tunnel may cut through the water table as well as underground sources of water.\n\n\n=== Pumping ===\nWhere it is clear that natural supply will not be sufficient to replenish the summit level at the rate that water will be used (or to allow for unexpected periods of drought) the designer may plan for water to be back-pumped back up to the summit from lower down. Such remedies may of course be installed later, when poor planning becomes apparent, or when there is an unforeseeable increase in traffic or dearth of rain. On a smaller scale, some local pumping may be required at particular points (water is continually recycled through some locks on the Kennet and Avon canal).\n\n\n=== Water saving basins ===\n\nA way of reducing the water used by a lock is to give it one or multiple reservoirs, whose levels are intermediate between the upper and lower pounds. These reservoirs can store the water drained from the lock as a boat descends, and release it to fill the next time a boat ascends. This saves half the amount of water lost downhill in each fill\u2013empty cycle. Generally these reservoirs are called \"saving basins\".\nInstalling a single side pond will save 1/3 of the water, whereas three side ponds will save 60% of the water: the first 1/5 of the water goes into the top pond, the 2nd 1/5 into the middle pond, the 3rd 1/5 into the bottom pond \u2013 and 2/5 is wasted at each passage (assuming the area of each pond equals the area of the lock).

Due to the use of 10 water saving basins, only 10,500 m3 of water are used. A more recent example is the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal with 13 saving locks out of a total of 16 locks.\n\nOn English canals, these reservoirs are called \"side ponds\". The Droitwich Canal, reopened in 2011, has a flight of three locks at Hanbury which all have operational side ponds. Side ponds were also installed on the Grand Union Canal and the Coventry Canal, among others. They are now out of use, and in some cases have been filled in, because British Waterways considered that it was too easy to misuse them and flood the surrounding area.  On some flights of locks with short intermediate pounds, the pounds are extended sideways \u2013 in effect to provide a reservoir to ensure that the pound does not run dry (in case, for instance, the lock below leaks more than the lock above). These extended intermediate pounds are sometimes confused with side ponds.\n\n\n== Alternatives ==\nAs well as the \"static\" approaches mentioned earlier (various types of contouring, excavating, and spanning), there were many ingenious \"dynamic\" solutions, mostly variations on the boat lift or the inclined plane. These tend to be more expensive to install and operate, but offer faster transit and waste less water.\n\n\n=== Inclined plane ===\n\nAn inclined plane consists of a cradle (to hold a barge) or caisson (a box full of water in which a barge can float) which moves on rails sideways up a slope from one waterway to the other. Since the box is \"wet\" (filled with water), Archimedes' principle ensures that the caisson always weighs the same, regardless of the size of boat being carried (or even if it contains only water). This makes for easy counterbalancing by a fixed weight or by a second caisson. The motive power may be steam or hydraulic, or may come from overbalancing the top caisson with extra water from the upper waterway.\nThere are no working waterway inclined planes in the UK at the moment, but the remains of a famous one can be seen at Foxton in Leicestershire on the Leicester arm of the Grand Union Canal. The plane enabled wide-beam boats to bypass the flight of ten narrow locks, but failure to make improvements at the other end of the arm and high running costs led to its early demise. There are plans to restore it, and some funding has been obtained.\n\n\n==== Marine railway ====\n\nA marine railway is similar to a canal inclined plane in that it moves boats up or down a slope on rails. However, the vessel is carried in a dry carrying frame, or cradle, rather than in a water-filled caisson. The principle is based on the patent slip, used for hauling vessels out of the water for maintenance.\nIn operation, a boat is navigated into the carrying frame, which has been lowered into the water. The boat is secured to the cradle, possibly by raising slings under the hull using hydraulics, and the cradle is hauled out of the water and up the hill with a cable. At the top of the slope, the cradle is lowered into the upper waterway, and the boat released. As the boat is not floating, Archimedes' principle does not apply, so the weight lifted or lowered by the device varies \u2013 making counterbalancing (by dead weights or a second boat carriage) more difficult.\nIn some locations, such as the Big Chute Marine Railway on the Trent-Severn Waterway, in Ontario, Canada, a marine railway was installed as a temporary measure at the planned site of a flight of conventional locks. In this and several other cases, the locks were never built, and the marine railway continued to serve on a permanent basis.  Where there is a steep rise in the land a marine railway may be more effective than multiple locks, such as on the Elbl\u0105g Canal.\n\n\n=== Boat lift ===\n\nThe Falkirk Wheel, the world's first rotating boat lift, acts as the centrepiece of the restoration of the Forth and Clyde and Union Canals. The Wheel replaced a flight of locks which formerly connected the canals and which were filled in in 1930. It was the winning design in a competition to design a new lock. Visitors can now take a boat trip on the Wheel and be lifted over 100 feet (30 m) in a few minutes compared to the time it took when the original lock staircase operated.The Victorian Anderton Boat Lift, the world's first vertical boat lift, linking the Trent and Mersey Canal and the River Weaver in Cheshire, has recently been restored. The world's highest boat lift in Str\u00e9py-Thieu in Belgium raises or lowers 1,350 tonnes boats by 73.15 metres.\nAnother derivative is the Peterborough lift lock which is a boat lift located on the Trent Canal in the city of Peterborough, Ontario, Canada and is Lock 21 on the Trent-Severn Waterway. Its dual lifts are the highest hydraulic boat lifts in the world, rising 19.8 m (65 ft). This was a considerable accomplishment when conventional locks usually only had a 2 m (6.6 ft) rise. Each lift has a capacity of 1,300 tonnes. The basins are 140 feet (43 m) long, 33 feet (10 m) wide and 9 feet 10 inches (3.00 m) deep. The vertical distance lifted is 65 feet (20 m). The Trent-Severn has another similar lift lock at Kirkfield, with basins of the same dimension, but which lifts over a smaller vertical distance.\n\n\n=== Caisson lock ===\n\nAround 1800 the use of caisson locks was proposed by Robert Weldon for the Somerset Coal Canal in England. In this underwater lift, the chamber was 80 ft long and 60 ft (18 m) deep and contained a completely enclosed wooden box big enough to take a barge. This box moved up and down in the 60 ft (18 m) deep pool of water. Apart from inevitable leakage, the water never left the chamber, and using the lock wasted no water. Instead, the boat entered the box and was sealed in by the door closing behind it, and the box itself was moved up or down through the water. When the box was at the bottom of the chamber, it was under almost 60 feet (18 m) of water \u2013 at a pressure of three atmospheres, in total. One of these \"locks\" was built and demonstrated to the Prince Regent (later George IV), but it had various engineering problems and the design was not put into use on the Coal Canal.\n\n\n=== Hydro-pneumatic canal lift ===\nPossibly inspired by Weldon's caisson lock, William Congreve in 1813 patented a \"hydro-pneumatic double balance lock\" in which two adjacent locks containing pneumatic caissons could be raised and lowered in counterbalance by the movement of compressed air from one caisson to the other. In about 1817 the Regents Canal Company built one of these locks at the site of the present-day Camden Lock, north London.  Here the motivation was, again, water supply problems.  The company insisted on various modifications to Congreve's design; the resulting installation proved to be unsatisfactory, and was soon replaced by conventional locks.\n\n\n=== Shaft lock ===\n\nLooking superficially similar to the caisson lock is the shaft lock.  Shaft locks consist of a deep shaft with conventional upper gates.  The lower gates are reached through a short tunnel.  The gates only close off this approach tunnel so do not have to reach the full height of the lock.  Notable examples have been built at Saint Denis (Paris, France), Horin (near Melnik, Czech Republic) and Anderten (Hannover Germany). The shaft lock at Minden 52\u00b018\u203223\u2033N 8\u00b055\u203211\u2033E has a fall of 12.7 metres (42 ft) and has eight tanks linked in pairs to the lock chamber.  As the lock is emptied water is run into each chamber in turn, for filling the water is released from the chambers thus saving the waste of a complete lockfull of water.  An earlier attempt at a shaft lock had been made at Trollh\u00e4ttan in Sweden on the line of the present G\u00f6ta canal.  The fall would have been 16 metres (52 ft), astonishing in 1749.  However the approach tunnel proved to be unusable in times of flood and the shaft lock was replaced by a 2-rise staircase in 1768.\n\n\n=== Diagonal lock ===\nThis new concept in lock design has yet to be installed on any waterway. It is basically a shaft lock with a diagonal shaft. The proposal is for a long tube of reinforced concrete, of a size to accommodate the boats being lifted, to be built on the slope between the upper and lower levels. The bottom of the tube is sealed with a strong watertight door, but there is a single pair of conventional lock gates at the top, installed a boat's length from the far wall of the tube. The change in level is achieved by filling the tube with water from the top pound, or by draining. The vessel floats on the surface of the water, with a guide float or pontoon, shaped to fit the tube, floating alongside to keep it clear of the walls. Side ponds, piped from the main tube, are incorporated to save water. In replacing a traditional flight or staircase of locks, a considerable time saving is anticipated. It differs from the similar caisson lock design in that the boat does not have to be carried in a submerged chamber.\nThe \"Diagonal Lock Advisory Group\" has identified several sites in Britain where the new design could be installed, either on new waterways or canals under restoration. Projects under consideration include the restoration of the Lancaster Canal to Kendal and the proposed new branch of the Grand Union Canal between Bedford and Milton Keynes.\n\n\n=== A combined system \u2013 the Three Gorges Dam ===\nAt the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) in China there are two stairsteps of five large ship locks (each 300 m long and 35 m wide) for ten-thousand-tonne ships. In addition to this there will be a boat lift (a large elevator) capable of moving a three-thousand-ton ship vertically in one motion. The locks and the boat lift provide a total lift of up to 113 metres.\n\n\n== Ship sizes named after locks ==\nLocks restrict the maximum size of ship able to navigate a waterway, and some key canals have given rise to the name of standard ship sizes, such as the Panamax and the Seawaymax.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCanal pound\nCanal Safety Gates\nSluice\nWater slope\nControl lock\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDeepest Canal Locks in England\nInteractive simulation of lock operation \u2013 this demonstration shows guillotine-type gates for clarity\nInteractive lock game for students with single and double flight locks and lesson plans\nVideo footage of the unique Drop Lock at Dalmuir on the Forth & Clyde Canal",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Liefkenshoektunnel is a toll tunnel between Antwerp and Beveren under the River Schelde. The tunnel is a continuation of Highway R2, the ring motorway surrounding the city and harbour of Antwerp. In 2010 the tunnel was used by 6,373,894 vehicles. Positioned between the Beverentunnel and the Tijsmanstunnel, the Liefkenshoektunnel is the second of three sequential road tunnels running under the river and port installations.   \nThe tunnel takes its name from nearby Fort Liefkenshoek. It was constructed between 1987 and 1991, and opened on 10 July 1991.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe tunnel is 1.37 km (0.85 miles) long.   It comprises two parallel bores, each of which contains a two-lane roadway: each lane is 3.75 metres wide and the bores also include a hard shoulder.   The tunnel can be used by vehicles up to 5.10 metres tall and, where exceptional loads need to be transported through it, up to 7.50 metres wide.Escape doors on the right side of each bore give access to emergency exit corridors.   These are separate from the ventilation and drainage ducts.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe tunnel was constructed in eight preformed sections, each one 142 metres long, in a temporarily created dry dock nearby in what is now the location of the Vrasenedok.   These sections, still sealed at the ends, were then precisely positioned using tugboats and sunk into position.\n\n\n== Funding and tolls ==\nFunding for the tunnel was provided by means of a ring-fenced financing provision, so that tunnel revenues would not be accessible as general local government revenues.   As of 2014, the toll was set at EUR 6.00 for vehicles lower than 2.75 metres, and EUR 19 for taller vehicles.   However, when the southern portion of the ring road, via the Kennedytunnel, is subject to roadworks, leading to above average congestion, tolls on the Liefkenshoektunnel may be temporarily suspended in order to encourage drivers to use the (for most destinations longer) northern ring road round Antwerp rather than the (permanently toll free) southern route.   \nReduced toll rates are offered to drivers prepared to pay using a credit card and an automated toll gate, as well as for drivers willing to have their cars fitted with a radio controlled device enabling tolls to be charged to their accounts without the need to stop at the toll barrier (\"Teletol\").\n\n\n== Usage ==\nPeak usage was reached in 2004.  In that year 4,676,441 passenger car journeys and 2,434,496 commercial vehicle journeys were undertaken through the tunnel.  In 2009, with the tolls increased by 10% for passenger cars from EUR 5.00 to EUR 5.50 and by 6% (from EUR 17.00 to EUR 18.00) for larger vehicles, usage had actually declined by over 10% to 4,197,236 passenger car journeys and 2,176,658 commercial vehicle journeys.Usage and revenue were below forecast, possibly because on the Dutch side of the nearby frontier, between Bergen op Zoom and Dinteloord, a projected direct four-lane highway towards Rotterdam, has still not been built.   The competing route through Belgium to Rotterdam which runs a short distance to the east via Breda was suffering intensified congestion in 2004 due to an upgrade which has subsequently been completed.\n\n\n== Rail tunnel ==\nIn September 2008 work began on two additional bores for the Liefkenshoektunnel, intended to carry trains. Scheduled for 2014, the project was completed on 9 December 2014. The 6,750 m Antigoontunnel is also known as the Liefkenshoekspoortunnel.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Beautiful park with well treated animals. There's lot's of space, so you'll alse have a nice, healthy walk. There's a lot going on for children: a playground, a climbing tree, feeding moments, walks through some cages (birds / pinguins,...). We went there when it was very calm.",
          "Excellent day out for all ages. The zoo is in great condition and all the animals seem happy and well looked after. Everything about the zoo was excellent and it has different themes for different countries ( Africa, Asia, Europe ) 5 in total. You can spend the complete day",

          "Very interesting. 4-5 hours needed to see all animals. Lots of different animals to see, seeing the feeding of the animals",

          "Planckendael is partitioned into geographical sections, each representing a continent - and I would estimate an hour to see each continent. Including a break for lunch and a couple of smaller breaks, I estimate an entire day to see the whole thing. I remember working out that",
          "Great park closed to Brussels. Many activities for the kids and very interesting visit of the 5 continents Expensive but worth it",
          "This zoo had a great mix of animals and nature! And a lot of fun little games and obstacle courses for kids. It seemed like almost every exhibit had a new addition born in 2016! Well organized and themed areas and paths made it easy and fun to navigate",
          "You should have a whole day free to visit this zoo in a large park area. A lot of animals in their natural environment are kept in new premises with a lot of trees, plants and nice decoration. A few playgrounds for children are very welcome when you have your family with you.",

          "The park is huge, green and beautiful and kids love this place. Not only because of the animals, but also because of the plentitude of playgrounds. You can rent wagons for one or more kids at the entrance. There are a lot of shows and feedings ongoing during the day, so a bit of",
          "A very nice place to go with the children on a sunny day. Lot of animals, nice and structured presentation but a little bit untidy. Overall we had a good time. There are restaurants too and they are quite good. Our kids enjoyed the playgrounds too. Worth visiting.",
          "This is a really great animal park for everyone! I can walk here all day long watching the animals, enjoying the sun and the nature. It's busy in the weekends and in the school holidays but on weekdays it's very calm in the park and you can enjoy a nice walk.",

          "Great kids play areas. There's a net you can walk on, apparently over a live crocodile, {actually a statue} that is a lot of fun for adults too. Impressive rhinos. Cute beavers. Tasty sweets in the souvenir shop.",

          "The park is amazing, we took the Planckendael express from Mechelen station to the park. The park is very green and the animals all looked really wel and taken care off, for the smaller children there are a lot of playgrounds when they get tired of looking at the animals !",
          "Since they did some major improvements to the park, making a visit more interactive, it is even more fun now to visit the park with our children. Before we sometimes just went for the play areas, but now it's mainly for the animals. Especially the penguins are a big favorite...",

          "This is one of the most completed zoo's I have visit in Europe. The animals are well taken care, all is saved for them but also for children. It is big enough and it is full of variation for children of all ages. They have a very good 'abonnement' where for the price of 1,5",
          "The Zoo was excellent place for a day picnic with kids and family. It has variety of attractions and animals. I liked Lion & its family with young cubs. Elephant family. Parrots was really awesome, but it was showing more love towards us if you buy a juice for them. Giraffe was",

          "We visited here whilst on a 5 day stay in Brussels. We booked at the train station which included train travel, bus journey and entrance. They have an express bus which is situated at the rear of the train station in Mechelen. The bus trip takes about 10 mins and stops directly",
          "Went to Planckendael on a rainy day during a stay in Mechelen. It's just outside of Mechelen, about 10 mins on the bus from the bus station. Really interesting having the different zones/regions to go into making it a little different. Highlight for us were the red pandas,",

          "The title says it all: this is most probably one of thr finest zoos around. It used to be the \"little brother\" of the Antwerp Zoo but it's, since a few years now, outperforming them in all apsectd. Especially with young kids this is a fantastic opportunity to discover thr link",
          "Planckendael is linked with the Zoo of Antwerp. Here the larger species needing lots of space are housed. Elephants, lions, giraffes, jaguars, snow leopards, ... they have nice large natural enclosures. Renowned for their Storches research Planckendael is a full day trip.",
          "Perfect mix of zoo, parc, and playground. The decors are beautifully made, the animals have plenty of room, and the kids (but also the adults :-)) will have plenty of fun in the multiple playgrounds and 'high-in-the-trees' climbing paths.",
          "Enjoyable experience with animals. They have more space than in most zoos. Easy access and parking. Full day activity. Spring is the best time to visit when a lot of the habitants have offspring.",
          "The 2 parcs that compete in Belgium are Pari Daiza and Planckendaal. The main difference is from my view their mission statement. Pari Diaza has a very strong commercial mission and you start to see and feel that. It developed itself fast. A great and well organised parc, but",
          "On arrival at the zoo, we were a little surprised at the lack of information about the activities in English. We queued for over 30 minutes with lots of children. Only to discover inside we didn't know what we were there for as everything was in Dutch. A lady stood on a chair",
          "Great place to visit with our without kids. And especially worth a visit now with the baby elephant Qiyo.",
          "Paira Diaza is a million times better!! I was so disappointed. The park isn't like it was 3 years ago. Everyone working there were job students, who we're rude and lazy (1 ice cream seller had to use a calculator to multiply 2 x 1.80 euro!!). I was happy to leave.",
          "I'm not into zoos as a rule - nothing political or ethical, they just don't float my boat. But for a family day out, particularly with younger kids, Planckendael ticks all the boxes. It's well signposted and easy to find, parking is easy and the entrance fee is reasonable.",
          "I visited here with my husband and two boys (8 and 10), my cousin and her husband and two kids (2 and 3) and my aunt and uncle. We all enjoyed our time here and were pretty tired at the end of the day! The animals seem to be well taken care of and you can get quite close to some",
          "One of the 3 big animal parks in Belgium. Not actually a zoo because the animals have more space. Don't forget to see the baby elephant Qiyo when it's still little ;).",
          "Nice natural looking zoo, spacious for nice walks. Must do is the feeding of the Loris in the conservatory. Perfect to spend a full day with kids of all ages. If you visit the place several time best is to buy a family pass that gives you access to Antwerp zoo too.",
          "Fantastic! A must if you have children! A good combination of zoo and playground. A pleasure for both parents and children.",

          "Very nice park, made with lots of imagination, huge parking lot, nice facilities, animals look well taken care of and generally happy.",
          "The zoo is organized by continent and has a nice mix of large and small animals. The star attractions are the baby elephant and baby giraffes. It is well worth the visit and is certainly popular with families. The storks are worth a visit alone.",
          "Very beautiful set up zoo near Mechelen. Animals can be watched in their 'own' environment per continent. Every continent has it's own spots where you can sit and relax, enjoy a drink or food and where the children can play in nice playgrounds. Friendly staff, good",

          "If you need a workout, go to this zoo It was quite big and it took us about three and a half hour to see all Although the zoo was very big ( in woodlan) it did not have many animals we thought. But it was 'build' lovely and detailed .",
          "This zoo has it all. They are successful with their breeding programs for elephants and giraffes. The animals get plenty of habitat and you can view them from great platforms. There are plenty of playgrounds for the kids, and they are located next to the restaurants. So you can",

          "We love, love, LOVE Plankendael. It always makes for a great day out. Put on your most comfy shoes because you are in for a lot of walking. There are strollers for rent for younger ones. Between beautiful old trees you walk from continent to continent discovering the animals",
          "If you visit this zoo, you're definitely in for a good walk. There is a wide range of different animals, going from Elephants to foxes to goats to lions. They all have a lot of space to walk around. During rain the paths might be a bit muddy. There are a few areas you can get up",
          "We went here with our godchild and love it. A lot of space a big variation in animals and enough F&B outlets.",
          "it was really wheelchair friendly. But it is a huuuuge park so be prepared for a lot of walking. There are plenty of places to sit and lunch. Animals look healthy and lively.",
          "I actually have visited this zoo a couple of times with my boyfriend, and I like it very much! The animal viewing is very nice, and the park is very open and \"foresty.\" In contrast to the Antwerp zoo, which is in the middle of a very large city, Planckendael feels much more",
          "a plesant open air zoo for younger children; not quite as spectaculas as PARADISIO, but worth a detour. playground lovely, as is parking",
          "Nice to walk around, have pic nics. A lot of different animals in a nice park. It feels safe to let the kids discover and run around by them self's and play on the playgrounds .",
          "New style zoo with lots to discover, less cages and the animals have lots of space. Ideal for a visit with children!",
          "it will take you max 4 hrs to visit this lovely tucked away zoo with 2 kids. lots of parking and many play grounds. be prepared to be waiting for your kids to finish playing a lot but take it easy and relax. :-) the animals are in a lovely environment and the zoo is layed out",
          "We visited the Planckendael zoo late October. Our main motivation was the children area where little ones can freely interact with the animals. We thought our 1.5 year baby girl would enjoy it. And indeed she did. She could touch and play with little goats. We wished there were",
          "We were not that much impressed with the park. The fee is rather high (24\u20ac per person + 17 for kids + 7\u20ac parking) so we were expecting much more animals. But animals are few & some of them (like crocodiles) we did not managed to find. They were on the map but we looked & looked",
          "I have to say I personally disagree with the idea of keeping animals in places like a zoo. So I will try to be as objective as I can be. The place is more than half an hour by car from Brussels and is divided in continent areas, eg Europe, Africa, etc. There are a lot of",
          "The park would be twice as good if there were...SIGNS indicating how to get to the st least the main attractions!! The park is well-kept and has lots of animals but it is IMPOSSIBLE to find your way around...a real pity!",
          "It's a really nice place to be. Interesting animals, lots of plants and cool playgrounds are worth highlighting. Your experience however may loose a part of its charm on a crowded day. Parking traffic is not well managed leading to huge mess and wasted time. There's also not",
          "Planckendael was great fun for the young kids in our group (and some kid-at-heart adults too). The park is pretty huge. The animal enclosures are divided into themes of continents, and that, put together with the many eye-catching, interactive information plaques that litter",
          "In opposite to its counterpart Zoo Antwerpen, you can always see the work and constant changing in this zoo. Recent adding of a cool elephant park and a large giraffe pavillion ads to it's splendor. It's very nice for children too...some parts like the African village though,",
          "Well planted gardens and enclosures. well spaced large enclosures so expect a long walk Easy parking. various food outlets - usual zoo prices",
          "Great plan of the zoo makes you enjoy the different locations of the world with its animals. A great variety of animals, and playgrounds. Enough facilities when they're opened. We were unlucky to be here during the week, after summer holiday, so only one restaurant (Azia) was",
          "Great animal park, very good for family outings. A lot of beautiful animals to be seen. Very good price quality.",
          "Super great place , kids and we had so much fun there . A really well kept \"zoo\" . This is more like a forest kind of theme park . Animals look happy and well treated , clean and lots of things to do for the kids , slides, parks, rafts, climbing bridges and most animals roam",
          "My husband, daughter (5 years old) and I all visited Planckendael and absolutely loved it. The ropes are well made, and each climbing unit has a net underneath, making it safe and comfortable so that you can spend your energy climbing instead of worrying about falling or wearing",
          "A great zoo to visit with a variety of animals from various countries. Good outing for a day for the entire family. It has something to offer everyone in the family.",
          "Took our 6 year old and had a fantastic time. The continent theme was very well done and the animals had plenty of space. The penguin enclosure is awesome and there is plenty to do for children if they want to let off steam. Would definitely go again.",
          "Great zoo with 5 continent theme sites, each home to their native inhabitants. Some of the animals come close enough to touch (penguin, storck, ...), but we tell our kid not to. Relaxed strolling from one place to the next, even with small kids (3Y) and a stroller for the baby.",
          "Probably my daughter's (and my) favorite \"exhibit\" was the penguin display; they were, indeed close enough to touch. Please don't, however. There are also various furry animals (names now forgotten) that you can touch and indeed will crawl over you. Fun for the kids, though I",
          "The zoo is spread over a rather large area. The enclosures are all quite big and the animals look well taken care of. The variety of animals isn't that great thug, unless you like birds. The penguin enclosure is fantastic. You get to walk through the middle of it and the",
          "There actually appear to be more play areas than animals, but our twin 3 1/2 year-olds had a wonderful time. It was a very hot day and we were able to find plenty of shade. Prices in the food concessions were only a little high and the selection was good. We saw elephants,",
          "Several visits and I never get tired of it. Well-kept park, with continuous efforts for extensions and new attractions for kids. Large parking, ample food supplies for different budgets.",
          "This is a must to see, this Zoo is one of the best and the animals are so good looking! Sometimes you really feel as if you are walking in Asia while your stroll through the Asia area. Of course the pinguin area is one of the best, at least for me. If you are lucky one of those",
          "Planckendael is not just an ordinary zoo. They are looking for special experiences such as walking together with pinguins. The walking loops per continent are great. Combing different species in one place give a new experience.",
          "Planckendael is an open space zoo, better described as an \"animal park\". Continuous efforts are being made to keep the park up to date! Perfect for kids since there is a small petting zoo including goats and llamas :)",

          "This zoo was amazing! Absolutely beautiful, by far the best zoo I've ever been too. So much to do and we didn't even see everything. You could go two days running. Fantastic lay out, with multiple parks and play areas to keep children busy. Beautiful large enclosures, where the",
          "This is a fantastic zoo. It is huge and helpfully divided into continents with Asia the largest. It has lots of large animals including elephants and bonobos. Info is excellent and multilingual. It also has a number of superb adventure playgrounds and climable attractions. All",
          "In most animal parks, you can only watch the animals in a small environment, so they would allways be close to the visitor. In Plankendael, animals can walk and run in a large habitat, avoiding them to be packed together. A realy well kept park !",
          "This is a really good animal park. The attention to detail with all of the enclosures is impressive and its a very pleasant place to walk around. The kids love it and there are things to look at in every direction. There is a good balance of places to eat, picnic areas, kids",
          "After 15 years I went back to Planckendael in Mechelen, Belgium, and it was a real poitive surprise to me. The park is divided into 5 continnets and you can see animals in a nearly normal environment. Today the have also rangers who make an educative trip for kids possible. If",

          "Very nice zoo, really worth a visit! The most animals have a large space where they can run around. The place is safe and give a natural atmosphere what's pretty unique. Children will like it a lot and so do i :-). There is also a place to eat and to drink. You can easily reach",
          "A must. It is beautiful, animals in nice well maintained natural areas. Fantastic flowers and plants. There is activity for young and old and for the combination.",
          "Great park, lovely to walk around in, have a picknick and see all the animals. The animals are not in cages locked up, but have nice piece of land to enjoy themselves.",
          "Little children love the many play zones; they are just shortly interested in animals. Planckendael therefor is the ideal location. Just try to go there when the weather is not too good; otherwise it can be a little bit too overcrowded, even at Planckendael ...",
          "This zoo has undergone quite a transformation since I was little. The animals now have huge areas to roam in (the giraffes, elephants) and seem happy. They have incorporated some elements from the origin of the animals (Indian style village near the elephants for example). The",
          "we had been recommended to visit whilst we were in the area and were not disappointed. Park is very spacious with plenty of large areas for the animals, not giving the cramped feel like some zoo's. Good range of animals to see and easy to find with plenty of parking if driving.",
          "I was sold on going here when i heard they had koalas. It then got better when i found out they had snow leopards! This place is so much bigger than you'd think, with such a variety of animals it'll keep you entertained all day. There are various talks or feeding hours that you",
          "Although I live in DOM, my home address is a bare 10 minutes from Plankendael. Last week I watched a Plankendael promotion on TV and could barely believe what I saw. This is much more than just a little animal farm like many people believe. Animals from all over teh world, It is",
          "No animals in small cages here. It's a large park, but not too big to walk with kids. The animals get to live in communities (mixed animals) in decent size enclusures in a green environment. Perfect day out with kids! (our 5 year old goes several times per year since he was 2).",
          "We had discussed the year before that we should visit and this year we did; what a great place to go! our 2 year old had the time of her life and we must return next time around...Fantastic!",
          "also quite pricey for a day. The best part was the fact that from Mechelen Railway station you can take a boat (well, a converted Barge) to the back of the park so avoiding all the Q's and car parking hassles and presumably charges.",
          "Lots of different animals and this all in a very nice environmental setting. There are also several small playgrounds for children. Food and beverages are a bit expensive and not comparable with the quality of an average Belgian restaurant.",
          "Planckendael is a relatively new zoo, connected to the much older Antwerp Zoo. There is plenty of space for the animals to roam; the Continents which form the various sections of the Zoo are downright fun in the way they incorporate themes of their Continent, and there's plenty",
          "The zoo itself is very nice, but the kids and some adults, will really enjoy doing the climbing areas to see the zoo from higher! It also has a great park for kids to play and adults to have a cup of coffee!",
          "a extreme child friendly excursion is to go the zoo with the boat. Park the car around Mechelen railwaystation and at Comabridge , you can take one of the yellow boates (starting every 30 min) to Planckendael zoo. after 15 min with the boat you end up at the entry at the back",
          "Love how close you can get to the animals and the wide space the animals have to enjoy nature! Glad to see zoo's no longer keep animals in small cages!",
          "We go there at least once every 2 months since over 5 years. The kids love it, lots of space, friendly staff and great playing area's.",
          "While visiting the town of Mechelen, we took a detour and spent a day at Plankendael zoo. Absolutely worthwhile, well kept zoo, broad variety of animals.",
          "Very beautiful surrounding. Much more peaceful and child friendly than the zoo of Antwerp. The Zoo of Antwerp is also nice though. You can get quite close to the animals and the variety of animals is huge. Perfect for a day out with the kids",
          "Very nice park in which even a big crowd comes to rest. Much beter than his big brother in Antwerp. More accomodations to rest should be welcome.",
          "Park visited with the kids and they loved it very much, had been awhile since I've been there myself. There is lately changed and modernized a lot so I did not recognize it anymore and was pleasantly surprised. The new residence of the elephants is a highlight and the giraffes",
          "Nobody in the know takes their kids to the zoo in Antwerp. It is right in the middle of town near the train station and there is insufficient space for the animals. Planckendael is hardly the best place I've ever been to, but if you have kids, it's one of the best places in",
          "Near to Mechelen, some 25 kms from Antwerp you will find this wonderful zoo in the countryside. It is great to visit with children, many playgrounds. Recent modernizations show the animals in their (more) natural surroundings.",
          "It was a few years since my last visit, but it amazed me how much investments were made to upgrade their grounds to a level where you can't talk about \"just another zoo\" anymore. We have no children, but enjoyed every second in this amazing park. Congrats for the new elephant",
          "Me and my husband visited Planckendael with oud two kids (3y and almost 2y old) and my parents. We all had a great time. Although it's a zoo, there's lots of space... for the animals as well as for the visitors. For my kids, the visit to the little petting zoo (which is just one",
          "Planckendael is in a sense nice zoo. We have a yearly subscription. As a total concept zoo, planckendael still has a way to go.",
          "Always been my favorite, I've been to Antwerp & Planckendael last year. In Planckendael there are more animals, with much more space. In the middle of \"the green\". Really fan of the giraffes -area and african village. After 15 years, the raft is still fun.",
          "I love Planckendael, much more than any regular Zoo. It has wide walking lanes, lots of flowers, beautiful trees and the animal domains are well spread out through the park. Also, the animals have a fairly big space (it remains a zoo, though) to move around. There are picnic",
          "We headed to Mechelen during our stay in Brussels this March to go to Planckendael on the train. The website is only in French and Flemish so we couldn't do much research, and unfortunately had some trouble finding it! In April and June-August, we subsequently discovered, a",
          "great space for animal live. visit and learn more about the animals and elephants. Marvelous park with great promenades and good food to",
          "Almost all the animals were tucked away because of the cold. Understandable but then they shouldn't charge the full entranceprice.",
          "I found it to be yet another zoo like other zoos. But it is well maintained and there are several things to do here. A good day of outing and for the people with family there is plenty for kids to keep them busy here.",
          "With the new stay for the elephants, Planckendael is now certainly a 'full grown' zoo. Their residence is constructed like an Indian temple. The zoo has a continental format and you can find different animals in a very good imitation of their natural habitat. Another spectacular",
          "I have been here several times accompanied by 2 to approximately 10 family members or friends. Each time we enjoyed going here and there were lots of happy faces! The zoo is great for all ages. There is a large variety of animals from all 5 continents. The animals have",
          "the animals have a lot of space and the enviroment is adapted there is a great playing area for children",
          "A big park with lots of animals. perfect for a day out with the kids. And stil more en more enlarging.",
          "This is a very well-kept zoo with plenty of space for the animals which all look well-fed and well-kept. When the children get fed up with looking at the animals they can head for the rope walkways and climbing nets in the trees which will keep them amused for hours.",
          "A great zoo, reachable via Train(Mechelen)+boat, or via car. The animals have plenty of space and the public has great overviews to see the animals in a 'naturally' environment. Phantastic for children!",
          "have spent many pleasant afternoons with the kids over the years - nice open spaces so never appears too crowded with a great playgarden to end the visit off with while parents have a drink at the caf\u00e9",
          "No other zoo has this free and realistic approach to watching animals. A map is needed to find the things you want to see, else a labyrinth. A bit pricy but the abo is good value for money. Democratic food and drinks available.",
          "Animals look reasonably happy and well looked after. A great day out though very crowded in school holidays. Not surprising really. Not cheap either but at least not as expensive as London zoo !",
          "As an experienced wildlife traveler, it still is difficult to accept seeing wild animals in a zoo when I'm used to seeing them on African plains or Asian forests. But all in all Plankendael tries to give the animals large, open spaces with natural boundaries, like water ponds,",
          "It is a great place to walk around. I admit, there is something evil about a zoo and locking up animals but at least here the animals are surrounded by green",
          "It is a personal thing, I admit. I hate to see animals behind bars or otherwise constrained. Planckendael is better than the Antwerp Zoo (of which it is a branch) but it still is a poor sight to someone who has seen e.g. elephants roaming in the wild. It is pathetic.",
          "large zoo in the area of Mechelen/Leuven. regularly new exhibits. nice for a walk while admiring the animals in their natural setting.",
          "For tourists this may be a bit too far from other main sights, but if you have a longer stay in Belgium, and you have kids it's a must. Not only there are lots of animals in wide enclosures, but also some very large playgrounds.",
          "This park or zoo is amazing for outeries with the family. The entrance fee is a bit high but totally worth it. It's a nice place to be, sitting on a bench or walking around the big gardens viewing the animal kingdom",
          "It's nice to walk around and see different animals that aren't living in a cramped space. Especially the children are fond of this: the playground for children is also nice! Worth a visit if you have a free day!",
          "We have a subscription to this Zoo, which basically says it all: whenever you go there, there's always something new to discover. our kids love the place, and with the great playground at the exit, you always finish the day on a positive note.",
          "More space for the animals, often in social groups etc. You have a better view on them and the park itself is worth the walk. Absolutely a must-do",
          "Plankendael is nice to wonder around, for a zoo there is a lot of space and it gives more the idea of a park with exotic animals than the typical zoo.",
          "At the time I visited this zoo the last time, a big part was under re-construction. But I know the place from before. Now that the construction works are finished and the new home for the elephants built, I will definitely go again.",
          "This zoo is perfect for a day out. There are lots of animals and playgrounds and even a farm where kids of adults can touch the goats an sheep. The parc is big and it takes 4 to 6 hours if you want to see everything. Too bad you have to pay for the parking. You can also eat here",
          "if you like animals it's better to go to Plankendael ok it's not in antwerp but it's only 25km aside and a bigger park where you have the impression that the animals are better of - it's also a nicer place to walk and enjoy nature",
          "Quiet, amazing and huge zoo ! Lots of interactives for the young ones. Playground areas on several spots in the park. Friendly staff. Restaurants with good quality f&b.",
          "Very nice big zoo. Amazing for children, behind every corner is a playground. Very well maintained",

          "The little ones and the bigger ones love this zoo.",
          "This park combines wildlife with a walk in the park. Nicely done and certainly worth a visit",
          "This is not only a Zoo, but also a conservation park; they have breeding programs for endangered species. The zoo animals are divided over 5 Continents and with natural looking settings. The compounds of the animals are big, and there are educational signs. There is a lot of",
          "Very cool place to visit as soon as the weather lets you. No extreme good weather needed, always a joy to visit. You can do a small or a long tour, easy access for wheelchairs. At the end of the tour, there is a very nice caferaria, so keep a little place in your stomach for a",

          "Excellent to go on a sunny day but be carefull if it is a bit cloudy cause the park is huge and if it starts raining once you are already there you might get back to your car completely wet. Some parts have been under renovation forever. But animals have nice space for",

          "if you want to relax and let your kids run around, looking at animals and playing on a playground, it is ok. if you are adult and looking for an exciting day - stay away",
          "the zoo is expanding and renovating here, a perfect place for family outings : do try to get here from antwerp with the train/boat connection !!!",
          "Very nice place to see with kids, great animals, great playgrounds. Fast food a bit disappointing, but overall definitely worth a trip.",
          "Planckendael is a subsidiary of the Antwep Zoo, but here the animals have a lot more space than in Antwerp. You can get there by train/boat (combination ticket) or by bus and it is fun, especially with children.",
          "This is a very nice place to visit when the weather is nice. Unfortunately, here in Belgium we don't have that many warm, sunny days, so you really need to pick a good day to go to Planckendael. It can be very nice on a great summer day, but I think there's not much to do there",
          "What a nice zoo - very nicely laid out and well organized. Our 3-year old daughter loved it, and so did we. Highly varied population of animals (loved the kangaroos!). Even though it's a large zoo, it has a quite 'compact' feel, and walk from the parking isn't too far either.",
          "Plankendael is a part of the National Zoo, its a cooperation with the zoo in Antwerp. Its well maintained and the animals have lots of space to live. You can have a nice walk in the park and enjoy the beauty of nature. There are themes build in the park such as African village,",
          "This zoo is very large and will probably take you a whole day took walk and look around. Parking is close and not too expensive. The food available on the premises is fresh en good, although a bit expensive.",

          "Perfect for half a day with the kids, enjoy your own picnic or make your choice in the restaurant/on the terrace.",
          "Very nice zoo for young and old. In summer, take the boat from the Central station in Mechelen to Planckendael.",
          "This zoo is great. It has a lot of animals and loads of fun and interactive things for the kids to do. My daughter loved the tree top walk, the canoo and the other play things we found on our way through the zoo. I found it a bit hard to find my way around the zoo. Even though",
          "The zoo is located near Mechelen, but it's easy to reach with public transport ( from Mechelen station bus 284/285 10 min drive). In the summer there is also a boat. Its a very nice and clean zoo, with different areas( Azie, Afrika) The zoo is childfriendly, with a lot of toys",
          "Great place to visit with the kids, or simply if you are an animal fan. In april all the storks were coming in and commencing with their nesting - a great sight to behold. Apart from that there are the geografically sorted areas. I loved the \"Asia house\", with the gibbons,",
          "We live close to Planckendael and it is the place to spend time with children. Also good to get away from daily things and go back to a park where you can be alone. Nice for an hour walk or a whole Sunday afternoon. Very clean and well organized and the second best thing to real"

        "wiki": "Fort Breendonk (Dutch: Fort van Breendonk, French: Fort de Breendonk) is a former military installation at Breendonk, near Mechelen, in Belgium which served as a Nazi prison camp (Auffanglager) during the German occupation of Belgium during World War II.\nFort Breendonk was originally built for the Belgian Army between 1906-13 as part of the second ring of defenses of the National Redoubt protecting the important port-city of Antwerp. It was covered by a five-metre thick layer of soil for defense against bombings, a water-filled moat and measured 656 by 984 feet (200 by 300 m).During World War II, the fort was requisitioned by the Germans as a prison camp for detaining Belgian political dissidents, captured resistance members and Jews. Although technically a prison rather than a concentration camp, the Fort was infamous for its prisoners' poor living conditions and for the use of torture. Most prisoners who were detained at the camp were later transferred to larger concentration camps in Eastern Europe. Of the 3,590 prisoners known to have been imprisoned at Breendonk, 303 died or were executed within the fort itself but as many as 1,741 died subsequently in other camps before the end of the war.Today, the site is a national memorial and museum which is open to the public.\n\n\n== Construction and military use ==\n\nFort Breendonk was originally built by the Belgian Army in 1906\u201313 as part of the second ring of defenses of the National Redoubt protecting the important port-city of Antwerp. It was covered by a five-metre thick layer of soil for defense against bombings, a water-filled moat and measured 656 by 984 feet (200 by 300 m). It saw military service after the German invasion of Belgium in World War I. The siege of Antwerp begun in September 1914 and Breendonk came under fire from German howitzers out of range of its own guns on 1 October. However, the Germans successfully breached the Belgian line at Lier and were able to capture the city without making an assault on Breendonk. The fort's garrison surrendered on 9 October 1914. Breendonk was used briefly in World War II but was already militarily obsolete. During the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940, it served as the initial headquarters of the Belgian General Staff under King Leopold III but was abandoned as the Germans advanced. The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May 1940, beginning a period of German occupation which lasted until September 1944.\n\n\n== German prison camp: Breendonk I ==\nBreendonk was occupied during the campaign of May 1940 and soon transformed into a prison camp which was controlled by SS and other security agencies of Nazi Germany\u2014Sicherheitspolizei (SIPO) and Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in particular\u2014although Belgium itself was under military (Wehrmacht) jurisdiction and controlled by General Alexander von Falkenhausen.\n\n\n=== Administration and inmates ===\nOn 20 September 1940, the first prisoners arrived. Initially most of the prisoners were petty criminals, people deemed anti-social, or who did not conform to the German race laws. Later on, resistance fighters, political prisoners and ordinary people captured as hostages were detained as well. Another section was used as a transit camp for Jews being sent to death camps in Eastern Europe such as Auschwitz-Birkenau.\nThe camp was guarded by Flemish collaborationist paramilitaries as well as German SS units. Of the 300 prisoners that died in the camp itself, 185 were executed; many of the rest died of torture, disease or exposure. Most of those that did survive were transported to concentration camps. The German execution poles and gallows, as well as the torture chamber, are preserved in the current museum on the site.\nBetween 3,500 and 3,600 prisoners were incarcerated in Breendonk during its existence, of whom 1,733 died before liberation. About 400-500 were Jews. Most of the non-Jewish prisoners were left-wing members of the Belgian resistance or were held as hostages by the Germans. In September 1941, the Belgian Communist prisoners held at Breendonk were deported to Neuengamme concentration camp.Jewish prisoners in Breendonk were segregated from other prisoners until 1942. Thereafter, Jews were transferred to the nearby Mechelen transit camp and deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.\n\n\n=== Daily life in the camp ===\n\nUpon arrival at the camp, new inmates were brought to the courtyard where they would have to stand facing the wall until they were processed into the camp. They were forbidden to move and any motion was severely punished. In the camp, punishment consisted of beatings, torture in the old gunpowder magazine, hanging or execution by firing squad. Inmates were forced to watch any executions that took place. The camp commander Lagerkommandant Philipp Schmitt was known to set his German Shepherd dog (called \"Lump\") loose on the inmates. His wife was also known to wander the camp, ridiculing the inmates and ordering punishments at whim. Severe and arbitrary beating occurred daily. During winter 1942-1943, after the German defeat at Stalingrad, it occurred more than once that inmates, mostly Jewish, were forced by the Flemish SS guards to enter into the extremely cold water of the moat and kept there with a shovel. The victims gradually sank or fell into the mud and most of them, after a  struggle that could last for over 15 minutes, finally drowned.\n\nAll the prisoners were subjected to forced labour. The camp authorities wanted the earth that had covered much of the Fort to be removed and shifted to build a high bank around the camp to hide it from outside view. In the few years Fort Breendonk was used by the Nazis, 250,000 cubic metres (8,800,000 cu ft) of soil covering the fort were removed by the prisoners by hand at a gruelling pace. Prisoners only had hand tools to complete this enormous task and the soil had to be transported to the outer wall via hand carts on a narrow gauge railway system. The ground in the camp was often very soggy causing the rails to sink away in the mud. Prisoners were then expected to move by hand the carts filled with dirt, pushing and dragging them back and forth over a distance of more than 300 meters. This regime was imposed for over 12 hours a day, seven days a week, even in the worst of weather conditions. Orders were given only in German, so inmates were forced to learn the basic commands rather quickly or otherwise be punished for failure to obey orders. Prisoners were also forced to salute and stand to attention every time a guard passed.\nAccommodation in the fort consisted of the old barracks. Built from thick stone, without windows and with only minimal ventilation, these were extremely cold and damp. Each barrack room only had a small coal burning stove, and providing sufficient heating was nearly impossible. Rooms were originally designed for no more than 38 people, but frequently housed over 50 inmates sleeping in three-tier bunk beds on straw mattresses. The top bunks were highly prized. Inmates only had a single small bucket per room for a toilet during the night, and many of the sick and weakened inmates simply allowed their waste to drop down to the lower levels. This caused much fighting between inmates, which was probably what the guards wanted.\n\nPrisoners were allowed to use the toilet in the given order only twice a day. There were two gathering spaces inside the fort, east and west, each one with a small building, made of brick and without doors, equipped with four holes and one urinal. Only in 1944 a greater facility was added. But to go to the toilet was always done under surveillance, in group and in a hurry: an additional opportunity for the guards to intimidate and humiliate the prisoners.Jewish prisoners were segregated from other inmates and housed in specially constructed wooden barracks. These barracks were poorly insulated and over-crowded. Other prisoners were housed in cells, either in small groups or individually.  The aim was to isolate certain prisoners for later interrogation and torture.\nFood was severely rationed for the prisoners and distributed in different quantities to the various types of inmates. Jews received the least food and water. Prisoners were served three meals a day. Breakfast consisted of two cups of a coffee substitute made of roasted acorns and 125 grams (4.4 oz) of bread. Lunch was usually 1 litre of soup (mostly just hot water). Supper was again 2 cups of a coffee substitute and 100 grams (3.5 oz) of bread. This was far from enough to sustain a human being, especially considering the intense cold or heat, harsh labour and physical punishments the prisoners were subjected to.\n\nThis harsh treatment of prisoners started to leak outside the Fort to such a degree that the head of the administrative staff of the Military Governor of Belgium Eggert Reeder was compelled to order an inspection of the Fort because Von Falkenhausen \"did not want the camp to become known to history as the hell of Breendonk\". But the respite was short lived also because the SS seized and forwarded to Germany most of the food parcels sent in by the Red Cross.Conditions in the camp were so cruel and harsh that those who left alive were so weak that their chances of survival at the final destination were severely hampered. Often prisoners were so sick and weak that they were led straight to the gas chambers or simply died within weeks of their arrival. The regime in the camp was at least as harsh as in an actual concentration camp. On 4 September 1944 the SS evacuated the Fort, and all the remaining prisoners were sent to Buchenwald concentration camp. Fewer than 10 percent of the inmates survived the war.\nParticular controversy surrounds the Flemish SS guards of the camp, who so openly and cruelly turned against their fellow countrymen in blind support of their Nazi paymasters.\n\n\n=== Notable inmates ===\nFamed author, philosopher, and journalist Jean Am\u00e9ry (formerly Hans Mayer) was captured by the Nazis in July 1943 while fighting with Belgian Resistance. He was subsequently sent to Fort Breendonk, where he was severely tortured before being sent to Auschwitz. Am\u00e9ry discussed his experiences in a book he wrote about the dehumanization that occurred between victim and perpetrator during the Holocaust, a work he entitled At the Mind's Limits.Comics artist Marc Sleen also spent time in Breendonk, together with his brother, because his third brother was a member of the resistance. The Nazis hoped to hear them out about the whereabouts of their brother, but they never betrayed him. As a consequence Sleen, his brother and other prisoners were put in a death cell, where one of them was shot every day. By the time it was Sleen's turn he was lucky that D-Day had occurred, causing a mass panic among the prison guards. They took every prisoner with them to another camp, where Sleen was able to escape. Yet he would suffer post-traumatic nightmares about these experiences for the rest of his life.The artist Jacques Ochs was interned in Breendonk from 1940 to 1942, when he managed to escape. A few of the drawings he made during his time there had survived. He used them after the war to reconstruct scenes of life in the camp, and in 1947 published those in the book Breendonck \u2013 Bagnards et Bourreaux (\"Breendonck \u2013 Slave Laborers and Hangmen\").\n\n\n== Allied prison: Breendonk II ==\n\nThe officer of the British Army designated to liberate the camp late in 1944 was Charles Arnold-Baker, a German and officer in MI6. After VE Day, Eileen Younghusband, a WAAF officer and fluent French-speaker, acted as a guide to RAF personnel visiting the camp. She had been in Germany prior to the start of the war, and had encountered fleeing Jews. During the German bombing of Britain, she had been a radar filter officer giving warning of air raids. When the German V-2 ballistic missile attacks on London and elsewhere began in 1944, she was sent to Belgium with mathematicians to help locate V-2 launch sites.\nFort Breendonk was briefly repurposed as an internment camp for Belgian collaborators. This period of the Fort's existence is known as \"Breendonk II\". The internees were moved to Dossin Barracks, Mechelen, on 10 October 1944.\n\n\n== Later significance ==\n\n\n=== War crimes trials ===\nTrials of the Flemish SS guards, considered Nazi collaborators, were held during 1946 in Mechelen and including some guards and officials at Fort Breendonk.\nOf those who were convicted, 18  were sentenced to be executed by firing squad in 1947, two of which appealed their case and had their sentences revised to life imprisonment. Four others were sentenced to life in prison, one to 20 years in prison, and one other was acquitted, and two guards who were sentenced to life were never found.The Nazi camp commandant, Philipp Schmitt, was tried in Antwerp in 1949; he was sentenced to death and was shot by a firing squad on 9 August 1950. He never showed any remorse and denied all of the atrocities that occurred at Breendonk, claiming he was merely re-educating the inmates as he had been ordered.\n\n\n=== Museum and memorial ===\n\nIn 1947 Fort Breendonk was declared to be a national memorial, recognizing the suffering and cruelty that had been inflicted on Belgian prisoners during World War II. The fort is now a well-preserved example of the prison camps operated by Nazi Germany and a national museum. The Fort is open to visitors all year round and is located close to the A12 Brussels-Antwerp motorway.\nPictures of working Nazi internment camps during the war are rare and, for a long time, it was believed that absolutely no pictures of Breendonk during the war existed. But in the early 1970s a batch of photos of the camp was discovered in the possessions of Dutch photographer Otto Spronk. He had collected thousands of pictures and films of the Third Reich as part of his work for the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (Cegesoma). The collection consisted of 37 pictures depicting daily life in the camp. They were taken by German Nazi photographer Otto Kropf for propaganda purposes but were never used. All pictures are essentially cliche stills; none of the daily atrocities or horrors of the camp are shown. But they are the only reference material available. Several of the inmates on the pictures managed to survive the war and were able to identify the others on the pictures and the circumstances in which they were taken.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Nazi-German concentration camps\nCitadel of Huy\nNazi concentration camps\nThe Holocaust\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nPahaut, Claire; Maerten, Fabrice (2006).

          "We had a 3 hour tour with Peter Van Den Broeck, PeterBFast@hotmail, and no words can describe the passion that this guide puts into the presentation. His Uncle was a prisoner and he knows first hand of the horrors. Highly recommended",
          "Forget about your big well known concentration camps, this one is on your door step only a short trip from Calias on the main route into Brussels. Left as it was after the war, with easy to follow comentry it shows the brutality of the Nazi regime of the time. From shooting",
          "This was a very interesting tour, we all learned a lot and there were so many interesting and terrifying stories with the audio guide. I would recommend, even on the hottest day, to bring a sweater as it is cold inside, although with what the prisoners went through here, it",
          "Really impressive fort with the stories of what happened. It's way bigger then I thought and they have a great audiotour in all languages.",
          "First of all, you'll need three hours to complete the tour! But it's very well laid out, and the audio tour will tell you everything you want to know. And that will be impressive!",
          "We were staying in Brussels at Christmas and popped here with the children (14 and 5) and found it very informative and chilling. We missed quite a bit as not everything was in English but felt it was a brilliant, lesser known concentration camp that was well worth a visit. We",
          "We spent a week visiting various museums and memorials during our WW1 Centenary trip but it was Fort Breendonk and its time during WW2 as a concentration camp that will live in our memories forever. The horrors endured by those who were interned ther and the evil and barbaric",

          "This is one of the visits leaving a most lasting impression. The visitor gets a fair good idea of what happened in this camp during the world war II. With detailed documentation this visit remains in your mind.",
          "Visited as a family with two boys of 10 and 12. Couldn't disagree more with the few reviews which say unsuitable for kids, this sort of experience should be mandatory for all. We should never forget the horrors which humankind have inflicted on each other in the past and this",
          "They said it would take something like 2-3 hours for this - could have easily spent 4 hours though. Had been here years ago before the renovations and found it powerful, glad that they kept the old films with survivors telling their experiences directly. The audioguide is also",
          "When visiting this site give yourself about 2/3 hours .There is lots to see and look at with an audio sound as you go round ,you work yourself in your own language . This fort was used by the Germans in the second world war for keeping prisoners in",
          "A highly recommended visit. This camp was the most infamous spot in Belgium and place of unmitigated horror and suffering. The audio tour does not pull its punches and frequently leaves you skocked. Due to its frankness, it may not be best suited to younger visitors. Audio",
          "A self-guided audio tour takes you into the rich (albeit somewhat eerie) history of Fort Breendonk. We were amazed at all that it had to offer and the incredible things that took place here. I highly recommend this to anyone regardless of your historical knowledge or inklings.",
          "Very well preserved concentration camp. The audio guide explains stories of the former prisoners and that allows you to understand the horrors experienced and to know the atrocities that were commited in this place. Absolutely recommendable.",
          "It's a chilling place to visit that must be done!! The audio guide is very interesting and helps give an insight to the horrors that took place. Be prepared for the strong emotions that you will experience whilst there.",
          "I've been here with my nephews of 11 and 14yo. I think kids may learn this stuff in a safe environment. Which I thought Breendonk was. Now after the visit I'm not so sure because the way the text is said (audiotapes), is too dramatic for kids, my opinion. Therefore an average",

          "This is the fort that was used as a concentration camp during the Nazi occupation of Belgium (1940-44). The camp gained a reputation as a place of great cruelty, and whilst it was not an extermination camp, killings were carried out there. The original gallows and firing squad",
          "This is a must for both educational and cultural value. Every person should go visit to learn from past mistakes that should never ever be repeated in history. Man cannot rule or dominate over another man, not meant to be. Our tour guide, Bob, was both knowledgeable and",
          "As everyone can read, this place was not so much a concentration camp as it was a prisoner of war camp. The horrors that the prisoners received were beyond belief, no matter the reason for them being there. If you are an English speaker, make sure you take the guided tour",
          "It was a very intense experience. The fort is well mantained as it was in the 2nd world war, including some symbols. The audio guides are available in many languages including English, French, Dutch and Spanish, and the visit is very well organized. If you go together with a",
          "It was thanks to all the TripAdvisor reviews that we went to this little-publicised museum, and it is as moving, as worthwhile and as clearly presented as all previous reviews suggest. A visit we will never forget. The 460 bus from Brussels costs 6 euros return and stops right",
          "This place shows the horror of the Holocaust in Belgium. The atmosphere takes you back to the dark years of Naziregime in Belgium.",
          "Fort Breendonk is a must place to visit They have done a fantastic job in the up keep of it to make it as real to life as it was, you need to allow around 2-3 hours for a visit to take it all in . On entry you are givin a device with earphones to input numbers in on your route",
          "This place is well-preserved, with very thorough explanations, commentary and captions in Dutch, French, German and English. Take your time to follow the guide and pay your respects to those who did not share our privilege of birth today. The execution arena in the field behind",
          "This camp was one of the last on our two-week tour of Europe and we're so glad we made time to visit. It is dark, and scary, and the walls practically ooze sadness and despair...but we felt it was important for our five teenage children to see firsthand what the world allowed to",
          "For the dark place that it once was, Fort Breendonk is quite the historical place. Well organized and easy to walk around. The reenactments are on point and the information is very complete. We spent a good 4 hours in there, and while it may get a bit emotionally draining, it",
          "O God ... I can't believe how they spend their days .very helpful staff and they give us 2 audio guide mobile although we were 4 .and we pay for 4 we are thinking kids 6 and 8 will not show their interest but they do all the time they try to listen audio and ask many questions.",
          "Walk through the entire building and grounds. Take a audio (in any language) with you as it explains everything from the guards and how they eventually paid for there crimes here, to individuals when were kept here. Not just soldiers but mailmen and everyday people who were a",
          "Chanced on finding Fort Breendonk whilst staying nearby. Spent an educational, at times difficult, 2-3 hours here. One immediately thinks of the camps in Germany Poland etc, but not necessarily in Belgium. The lives spent here, albeit sometimes drastically foreshortened, appear",
          "Must see if you are visiting Antwerp. When entering you receive an audio device with the language of your choice. Half of the signs are not in English but you are still able to learn a lot about this camp and the conditions of its prisoners. Wherever there is an audio stop you",
          "This was a really impressive visit. The feeling you get when visiting this place is almost indescribable. You feel the cold and the moisture and you can really Imagine how it could be in those dark days with no hope and only sorrow. Never been so much confronted with the pain",
          "Altough im Belgian and interested in the cruelty of the concentration camps of the Nazi's i never visited this camp. So on a Sunny day i went there and i have to say i was surprised in a good way. The original fort is build before world war 1 but shows mostly the horror of the",
          "Although it seems a little unreal this old fort was indeed used as a concentration camp during World War II. Free parking at the front of the fort, 11 euros entry fee per person. Having never visited such a place ever before I was a little unsure as to how I would feel knowing",
          "This is a very interesting place to visit, the only reason I have rated 4 instead of 5 as it doesn't seem appropriate to say excellent as this was a concentration camp. Parking is free outside and entry was 11 euros per adult. We were given an audio guide in English which",
          "Very interesting to be able to visit such a well preserved work concentration camp. It was just eerie to me that these were used less than 100 years ago. Very eye opening to what the people in the camps had to go through. I would recommend visiting this if you are interested in",
          "Allthough I live close to the fortress of Breendonk, it took me more than 50 years, and a 13 yo son, to visit it. This well kept fortress looks as if only yesterday the SS-terror was stopped. Armed with a digital guide, in wich you can type the numbers of rooms and places, it",
          "Visited with family in 2/'16. Dress warmly! We came on a sunny February day, but the 'camp' is very dark and cold. We came with small babies, and a stroller is not possible. There was no sidewalks- lots of muddy situations, so dress appropriately. Lots of walking- it took us",
          "The visit was a spontanious one,I was driving to the airport and saw the fort on my way to brussels as i was walking through the fort i couldn't help but get really quiet and listen wat the audiotour had to say.the building felt as eerie as it would be so many years ago. It's",
          "Fort Breendonk is a must visit for those with an interest in modern history having played an important part in both world wars. Most of the museum focuses on WW2 and the forts function as a prison / concentration camp and is the most preserved example of such a camp. It's very",
          "This was a great opportunity to witness what horrible things many people had to endure. It was very eye opening and emotional to actually walk where they walked and to hear what they seen. At the entrance they give you a recorder box and headphones and you carry it through",
          "During WW2 the fort of Breenbonk was used by the Germans as a prisoner-camp. From their Jews and others could be deported to the more known camps as Auswitch and such. Taped witnesses guide you through the fort and history. Sometimes you will find it hard to be confrontated with",
          "This was a planned trip from Brussels. Take bus 460 but make sure you know to get off at the first stop in Willebroek. You need to signal to the driver to stop at \"Fort Breendonk\". The fare is 3 Euro from Brussels Nord. The Fort is well worth visiting with excellent audio",
          "I came here in March as a teacher with a group of 28 students from Ireland. And all I can say is unforgettable. The tour guide was absolutely fantastic and really helped the girls understand what it was like for people who were kept here as prisoners. He took on the role of a",

          "Many preserved areas. For 10 euro per person for entrance, and you get an audio guide device in English . The route is very well identified. Some of the internal expositions are only in Dutch and French.",
          "We expected to see a fort and what a surprise! We received a very personal, heartfelt and detailed account from ordinary people who were victimised by the brutality of the WW2 nazi regime. We had no idea that so many people from occupied Belgium fell victim to this sadist cult,",
          "I had expectations of this fort being surrounded with nothing, but when we drove to it, it wasn't far from a street of houses and had a restaurant (closed) in the car park. On first looks it appeared a bit sparse, the building itself not chilling or scary but the tall barbed",
          "From the first step you set in this facility the place grabs you and won't let you go. The atmosphere and the stories that come with the camp give you a grim image of what it was about during one of the world's darkest moments.",
          "This was a Belgium Fort in WW1 and the a Nazi prison camp in WW2. The audio tour is in many languages. My husband and I spent about 2 hours or so on the self guided tour. Everything is marked clearly so you don't get lost. There is an eery feeling in parts of the camp. I guess",
          "We landed in Brussels, got our rental, and came straight here prior to heading to Ghent (Breendonk is only 25 minutes from airport). A GPS will get you to the area, but I doubt it will take you straight to the site; it got us close enough to where we saw signs so you should",

          "Situated and built in Belgium, the Nazis seized control during WW2 and turned it into a concentration camp....the fort stands today as a memorial to freedom. The audio guide brings the atrocities of Nazi Germany to life and can't fail to leave a lasting impact. The tour should",

          "A sad and somber place which has been well preserved. Some of the more gruesome exhibits have been removed over the years. They have worked hard to convey the painful image of daily life there under the sadistic German and Belgian guards.",
          "We visited this as the first attraction on a saga \"war interest\" cruise of channel and north sea ports. The minute you enter the gates of this fort/camp you are struck by its solid formidable black granite castle type structure built 1905 but on medieval style with a moat but",
          "This is a place that is truly worth a visit. It is the most well preserved of all the concentration camps from WW2 and is a chilling reminder of horrors past. The route around the museum is clearly set out, but you move at your own pace, listening to a personal commentary as you",

          "A piece of history still very much to feel 'real' with many sights/smells so that one can imagine how horrific it was to be a prisoner of Breendonk during the war. Well done; a very moving experience that is recommended for both adults and children.",

          "This fort is unlike any other. While it lacks attributes, the structure and the surroundings immediatly saddens its visitors. You will be confronted with some of the worst horrors in World War 2. The cells and the various stories told about them are - in my opinion - not",
          "I booked ahead online for my group of 10 college students, arranging for an English speaking guide. She (our guide) was wonderful, a true historian. Even without a live guide, Breendonk is well worth a visit. Very well curated; the sadness, terror, and despair is palpable.",
          "Breendonk is said to have been the only WW2 Concentration camp in Belgium. It was run by Flemish and German SS. It held Resistance Fighters, Political Prisoners and Jews. There are many up close displays with witness testimony on TV screens. It was a interesting trip. The staff",
          "Very well set up. You really do need a minimium of 2 hours unless you plan to skip over some sections. Lots of information given - through a handset. You enter a number given at each section and the handset tells you about what you are looking at. There are lots of numbers",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "St. Rumbold's Cathedral (Dutch: Sint-Romboutskathedraal) is the Belgian metropolitan archiepiscopal cathedral in Mechelen, dedicated to Saint Rumbold, Christian missionary and martyr who had founded an abbey nearby. His remains are rumoured to be buried inside the cathedral. State-of-the-art examination of the relics honoured as Saint Rumbold's and kept in a shrine in the retro-choir, showed a life span of about 40 years and a death date between 580 and 655, while tradition had claimed 775 AD.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nConstruction of the church itself started shortly after 1200, and it was consecrated in 1312, when part had become usable. From 1324 onwards the flying buttresses and revised choir structure acquired Brabantine Gothic characteristics, distinct from French Gothic. After the city fire of 1342, the Master Mason Jean d'Oisy managed repairs and continued this second phase, which by the time of his death in 1375 formed the prototype for that High Gothic style. His successors finished the vaults of the nave by 1437, and those of the choir by 1451.During the final phase of 1452-1520, the tower was erected, financed by pilgrims and later by its proprietor, the City. Designed to reach 600 Mechlinian feet or about 167 metres, higher than any church tower would ever attain (Ulm Minster has measured 161 metres since the 19th century), the very heavy St. Rumbold's tower was built on what had once been wetlands, though with foundations only three metres deep its site appears to have been well-chosen. After a few years, in 1454, its chief architect Andries I Keldermans constructed the Saint Livinus' Monster Tower (or St.-Lievensmonstertoren as it is called in Dutch) in Zierikzee (in the present-day Netherlands), where leaning or sagging of the tower (now 62 metres but designed for ca. 130) could wreck the church. This concern led to fully separate edifices, a solution also applied in Mechelen. At both places, in the early 16th century the upper part of the tower was abandoned, not for technical but for financial reasons. St-Rumbold's should have been topped by a 77-metre spire but only seven metres of this were built, hence the unusual shape. A deliberately weak connection closed the gap between tower and church upon finishing the construction.The church has functioned as a cathedral since 1559. In the 18th century, each capital's surrounding ornament of sculpted cabbage leaves, that had been an inspiration for numerous Brabantine Gothic churches, was replaced with a double ring of crops. In 2005, after engineers had figured out the support capacity of ground and tower, there was talk of completing the entire spire from the original drawings.\n\n\n== St. Rumbold's Tower ==\n\nThe flat-topped silhouette of the cathedral's tower is easily recognizable and dominates the surroundings. For centuries it held the city documents, served as a watchtower, and could sound the fire alarm.\nDespite its characteristic incompleteness, this World Heritage monument\nis 97.28 metres high and its 514 steps are mounted by thousands of tourists every year, following the footsteps of Louis XV, Napoleon, King Albert I, and King Baudouin with queen Fabiola in 1981.\nOf the original carillon's set of 49 bells, which are still in working order, each has its own name. Some of the most notable are Salvator, which weighs 8884 kg; Jehsus, which was built in 1460; and the Liberation, which was the newest addition in 1947. Thirty-nine steps above this instrument, there is a second complete carillon on which concerts are played during the summer months. The total weight of both these carillons is over 80 tonnes and there are 98 bells in all.Many of the region's cities have a nickname for their populace. The Mechlinians are said to have had ancestors running up their great Tower and passing on buckets of water to extinguish a blazing fire behind the perpendicular windows, where it turned out to be mere moonlight through sprightly clouds, hence are called Maneblussers ('Moon Extinguishers').\n\n\n== Church interior ==\n\nThe main entrance, underneath the tower, leads into the nave of the cathedral (approximately 118 metres long).\nApart from small heraldic shields, dating from the Thirty Knights of the Golden Fleece chapter meetings presided in the church by young Philip the Handsome while his Burgundian inheritance was still under guardianship of his father, few original movables survive. Forty preciously decorated Gothic altars and all other furniture disappeared during the religious troubles of 1566-1585. Though the cathedral was spared in the 1566 Iconoclasm, Mechelen was sacked in the 1572 three-days Spanish Fury by slaughtering troops under command of Alva's son Fadrique, and suffered the English Fury of pillaging by rampant mercenaries in the service of the States General in 1580.\nThe interior features a Baroque high altar and choir by Lucas Faydherbe (with twenty-five paintings illustrating the life of Saint Rumbold), as well as paintings by Anthony van Dyck, sculptures by Lucas Faydherbe and Michiel Vervoort, and stained-glass windows,\nincluding one depicting \u2013 though with a white face \u2013 the Black Madonna painting in the church.\n\n\n== Churchyard ==\nIn 2010, prior to the construction of an underground car park at Saint Rumbold's north side, 4,165 skeletons were unearthed during archeological excavations of the cemetery.\n\n\n== Events at the Cathedral ==\nSt. Rumbold's was the venue for the 2008 wedding of Count Rodolphe de Limburg Stirum to Archduchess Marie-Christine of Austria, daughter of Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg.\n\n\n=== Papal visit ===\nIn 1985, on his 65th birthday, Pope John Paul II celebrated a Mass at St. Rumbold's. Jo Haazen, then the City's carillon player, heard him state: \"Your tower is not complete.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nFlor Peeters, cathedral organist between 1923\u20131986\nJean Richafort, choir master between 1507 and 1509\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrussels Cathedral site\n\"MECHELEN : Saint-Rumbold's Tower\".

          "We just looked at the Atomium. The Lights were wonderful. The environment however not so much. We didn't feel safe with 2 small kids. Racing cars, loud groups of people who smashed glass bottle, ... Police no where to be seen",
          "Great place, worth seeing. However commuting there takes some time. When it\u2019s windy (I mean really windy) the top part is swinging (just a little). Views are awesome",
          "It's a bite far from city centre but worth it. It's an amazing monument to visit. The view is spectacular and the visit is quite fun. The public transportation near the Atomium is not the best.",
          "Atomium is one of the symbols not just Brussels, for Belgium also. If the weather isn\u2019t good to you, don\u2019t hesitate to visit L\u2019Atomium. Not all the parts of this monumental building is available for the visitors, but every part has It\u2019s own \u2026",
          "Nice seeing this curiuos construction inside at several levels , at top level with nice wheater great views...",
          "An amazing discovery where you can actually walk inside those spheres! There are some interactions to keep the visit interesting and the view from the top is breathtaking. There is also a restaurant in the last sphere (I think it's kind of expensive from what I remember...)",
          "It looks nice bit don't go alone!! Strange people there, not so many tourists ..",
          "Great place nice people... Nothing to say! Really nice time:))",
          "Nice place. Lot of Waffle vehicles at this place. Make sure you try it out!! \n\nBeautiful view, must-visit!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude07",
          "An average place. The only thing I liked is its architecture. Somewhere I felt that inside stuffs are not much interested. We finished seeing everything in just an hour, which we were expecting at least two hours. Anyway if you are into architecture, you should go.",
          "Truly a simbol of the city of Brussels! Nine steel spheres representing the iron atom, the trust in technology of the 20th century. Nowadays, a great place to visit with family or friends. The wait time is a bit long, but it pays off. Recommend to anyone!",
          "Great view, especially at night. Very good restaurant. Nice for romantic celebration. Not much more to do there",
          "Nice piece of architecture, but it is a bit pricey to get in. The view is good from the top, but nothing breathtaking. The exhibition inside is also somewhat forgettable. If you want to save some money and not particularly interested in the 1958 fair and the construction I recommend to only visit the place from the outside.",
          "Really cool! Free to walk around and especially cool on a sunny day, to see the sun shine and glimmer off it. We didn't enter inside though.",
          "my absolutly #1 favourite place in Belgium & one if the nicer places to take a few breathtaking pictures with family and friends. I love to stop by on every occasion. \nThey have been reworking in the outer appearance... and it shows... enjoy the pictures from another great moment in my life ...",
          "I think it's amazing that the Star of David resides within the atom, but even more if view through the 3rd. Dimension, it is the emblem of my Book: The Code: Horizon of Infinity. Wherein you can read some parallel relative to the  the ancient Jewish tradition of mystical interpretation of the Bible.",
          "stunning food and amazing views. be careful because my father has his wallet stolen at the nearby tram station. apart from that a great day out and lovely weather",
          "I have visited this attraction before the COVID. This has been realized during an EXPO organized at Brussels, and I really enjoyed it. I could never imagine to enter inside an atom actually! All the 'balls' cannot be visited only to respect \u2026",
          "An possibility cool structure. Do have a coffee in the cafe in the top sphere - prices are much better than you would expect. The exhibitions are really well presented too.",
          "An iconic structure in Brussels that you should visit. But paying \u20ac16 to go inside is not worth it. They take pictures of you when you go in without even asking, and then put you in an awkward position to buy them when you go out. Of course \u2026",
          "Really beautiful structure! Although the inside displays are not super interesting, the view is beautiful though! Also, please be aware that when its windy the structure movea a bit!",
          "Interesting structure. Seemed well maintained despite the age. Very busy on the Saturday we were there, but queue management was good, despite attempts by several people to cut the line. Value for money was average, but on par with similar venues. Surrounding parkland also lovely to walk around.",
          "If you are in Brussels you must go here. You can choose to not go inside and relax in the park area. Or you can go inside, fee is 10 euro and i feel it is worth it. There is light and laser show inside, and gallery on history of Atomium. \u2026",
          "Cool place! There is a huge park there. So, you can spend a big part of the day. Nice place for family with kids. You can walk around, do a workout or yoga, or just read a book. Quiet and calm with a very good view.",
          "Worth a visit inside and out. My boys loved it and my husband and I enjoyed waking around with them. There was about a half hour wait in the queue, but well worth it",
          "We didn't go inside but we walked all around the place. There was a lovely park nearby and it's huge so you'll probably have a good feeling about Atomium. Worth a quick visit :)",
          "This is absolutely fantastic! The ticket is not very expensive, and you can buy the entrance of Mini-Europe together. The whole structure is very impressive and gigantic, wonderful place!",
          "On busy days, expect a long, LONG line to enter, as the single elevator only holds like 10 people. But, if you can handle the wait or simple visit during calm days, you'll love this structure. It has a weird atmosphere inside. And the view \u2026",
          "Very nice, interesting building. Good for a panorama view. The price to visit is a bit high (16 euros for an adult) and there really isn't much to see inside. However worth the trip.",

          "Expey was good. One of the iconic place in Brussels. You can take ticket and go up stairs by  lift.",
          "It is free to walk around and admire the structure although it is pretty far away from the city so I would suggest getting here by train or other public transport to save uber cost. Overall it is pretty underwhelming, the tickets to go inside are pretty expensive as well but it is nice enough to see it from outside.",
          "Really nice place.. You will find a nice view of bruxelles from the top... The restaurant is quite expensive in my opinion but looks nice...",
          "Pretty to see from inside and outside.",
          "Really amazing to visit in person. If you go to Brussels, this is an absolute must see.  We took our 12 year old and he loved it.",
          "We were here when the roads were being repaired, so it wasn't easy to get to the Atomium. But it\u2019s something, what you must see, when you\u2019re in Brussels. Dominant of Brussels. We walked from Brussels nord train station and it was pretty far away. Nearby is Japanese Tower - something you must visit too.",
          "Great experience! The view from the top sphere is nice even on a rainy day, the staff is very friendly and helpful and the exhibit is informative and exciting. If you visit it right before sunset, I recommend spending a little bit more time aroumd the area to see it light up!",
          "Had the pleasure of being in Belgium last year and after a hear weekend of drinking beer and everything else we visited this site, the Atomium. Absolutely had a blast and a recommencement site to visit, only wish we had more time at this site.",
          "Well worth a visit! Amazing structure, very unique. Extremely impressive from up close.",
          "This place has the best view of Brussels try not to go on a windy day as once you get to the top it shakes a little and there's a nice restaurant at the top floor. get ready to do some walking as there's some escalators but it's mostly stairs",
          "Overall nice to visit. More imposing from outside then I side. Not sure if it was worth to spend around 23 Euros for the lift ride....",
          "It\u2019s a symbol in Brussels. If you like history and deep tourism, you don\u2019t need to go. If you like to enjoy the iconic moments of every city, you have to visit the Atomium. But be aware, inside it\u2019s nothing memorable if you are not from \u2026",
          "Nice place to visit, but not very spectacular",
          "Great place, worth seeing! The view was spectacular.",
          "gorgeous! unfortunately not all the \"balls\" were accessible at the time of our visit, but we did get to see a special Bruegel exhibition in the main room instead ! definitely should check out the adams design museum while you're there, will make the experience even more worth it !!!",
          "It's an amazing structure, but I didn't have much fun there , maybe I went on the wrong day but ,as interesting as it could be , I found it boring at stages. I would suggest to theme up the place a little bit, I loved tin tin at the \u2026",
          "Loved the architecture of this beauty learned a lot of its architecture and definitely a picture with is mandatory even though it is far away from the main city one must definitely visit this to complete there trip due to it gaint \u2026",
          "One of the most attractive towers I have visited. Love the music and video program it makes you feel like you\u2019re in a Alien movie. Would love to visit it again!",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you're in Brussels! The exhibitions were cool, as were the lights in the tunnels around the escalators. The top escalators were out of order so we couldn't go all the way to the top for the panoramic view but we could still see a decent view from a window, and the price was lowered so still felt worth it",
          "Very cool and different place to visit if in Brussels. Close to the centre and definitely worth taking a look around inside for the views and exhibits.",
          "From the outside a spectacular view. On the inside; a missed opportunity. No clear guidance and on your trip down there is a lot of space but nothing really that makes the entire experience worth remembering.",
          "You will love this place!",
          "impressive building that evokes awe",
          "Good for some pics..",
          "The visit was too late to get inside. It was on a cold, wet winter night. There were still a few folks gathered in tiny groups outside it, still taking photographs. The sight itself was beautiful and majestic. That's how my visiting \u2026",
          "Worth seeing but not something special ..",
          "Iconic, and so worth it.  A big metal structure.  I had a great time.",
          "Interesting building, a must to visit but seriously more than 1 hour you should stand in a queue for elevator and then from top floor(which is a panorama view that is cool but doesn\u2019t make sense for ten minutes upstairs u stand 1 hour \u2026",
          "A very famous area near mini-Europe, but I had no idea that you can enter it when I visited.\nA little more guidance would\u2019ve helped.",
          "Massive structure, definitely worth taking a look",
          "Absolutely a must see, especially video performances on higher levels.",
          "Worth a quick visit. Didn't need to spend a ton of time. We walked from the city to experience other parts of the neighborhoods. Not super packed with people. Worth it to see, not to pay entrance. Toliets cost $",
          "Imagine you are a character in the movie \"Honey I shrunk the kids\" \nSame feeling around huge 102m tall iron crystal with 9 steel balls of 18m dia each. \nMore photo ops down the lane with church, park, tram junction etc",
          "This was an interesting excursion for the family. Personally, it felt a bit dated, however it was an odd and interesting experience. What I remember most is an interior room light show with strange music.",
          "Interesting building originally constructed for the 1958 Brussels World Expo.  This building is now a museum and some of the spheres are open and accesible to the public. The place is children compatible and they like it. The place is one of the most go places if you are in Brussels",
          "One of my most favorite places in the world. It\u2019s just cool!",
          "Amazing building! If you are in the Brussel, you must see this place.",
          "One of the view places I've visited without researching before going. Pleasantly surprised. Loved the art exhibit that was there when we went. The student ticket the combined the design museum and Mini Europe was definitely worth the price. \u2026",
          "If you can spare a few hours to visit it's okay but you won't miss anything if you don't go either. Nice for pictures.",
          "Offers a lovely 360 view of the city. Although did not find it exciting enough part from the views. If you are short on time, just click it from outside and move on!",
          "Was a great attractions. Interesting to see, it speaks for itself. If you go please don't second guess and visit right away. We seen the structure had waffles outside and spent half of the day checking the tours etc.",
          "Great place. A very interesting building, nice temporary and permanent exhibitions, and great views of the city. The only downside was that I waited about 40 minutes to get on the lift to the top of the Atomium.",
          "The sculpture is really nice, but inside was a bit boring, it had just had the history of how it was built and then some art near the top floors. I wouldn't waste money going inside unless you want pictures of the landscape at the top floor.",
          "I do not know about you but I thought this place was small but it is not. It is huge!! Really really must visit! To go inside we paid 8 euros (students). you start from the top and then you go down. \n\nInside there is a 360 degrees view of \u2026",

          "I have always wanted to visit this sculpture because I love science. My boyfriend thought it was quite random, but I thought it was fascinating. We went in the rain, so indoor spaces were crowded. Theres not much to do around here unless you want to go into the atom. Awesome pictures from outside!",
          "One of the unsualest buildings of the world.  Massive felling when you're looking at the balls from the ground",
          "Nice place in a good area. I\u2019m not sure that it worth to go inside, but building itself and surrounding parks are beautiful. Also there are few good museums near Atomium. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "Beautiful sculpture that was such a treat to visit! You take the elevator to see the beautiful view from the top, then you get to explore 6 different levels of an exhibition detailing its history, an artist (or another temporary exhibit). \u2026",
          "It is nice and different place and it has amazing views. You can see Mini-Europe!\n\nNot very comfy for going with a baby because of the line for the elevator. When I was in January, 40 min waiting. And the baby was uncomfortable, so when I \u2026",
          "The structure looks too good. It was huge and a great spot to visit. But I feel the museum inside was not worth it. There could have been better arrangements inside and it just explains the history of the museum and some abstract arts. I think it's good to just take pics from outside and move on to your next appt to visit!",
          "Interesting structure! Inside you feel like in the spaceship:). But when you on top ,make sure it's sunny day or at least clear sky. I catch the fog around Brussels and couldn't see much.",
          "What a spectacular building! When I saw this on some pictures, I hoped that I would see it in real life someday. During my trip to Brussels I had the best chance to make my minor dream come true. Within the building there are multiple \u2026",
          "The structure itself is really cool. The content inside is somewhat interesting, but not outstanding. Worth visiting to see the structure, take views of the city, and learn random things",
          "Amazing how people thought of creating a gigantic atom. Its a famous tourist spot in Brussels, in which taking a picture with fewer or no people behind is an art. People are allowed to enter the circles of this atoms, with fee and long lines. It think it was a bit windy when we went, because the place it actually an open field.",
          "The view is interesting, i wish there are more area to explore.\n\nThe instructions about \"how to explore\" wasn't very clear, basically you just follow the person in front of you will be fine.\n\nSpent almost half of the time just to queue to \u2026",

          "Well worth a visit, lovely looking structure... Great views from the top and a great bar at the top you can have some snacks or a nice Duvel beer! Worth a look! Plus very close to Mini Europe, can do the two in one go.",
          "It was an amazing experience to visit this museum. There are several thing to learn and see. There is a restaurant, but wasn't in service when I visited. I think it is a must see when you're in town.",
          "nice structure you must visit in brussels",
          "A seminal totem in the Brussels skyline. Neither tower, nor pyramid. Half-way between sculpture and architecture. A relic of the past with a determinedly futuristic look. The Atomium is the only symbol of its kind in the world, which eludes \u2026",
          "Appreciated this piece of architecture more the second time round! Huge structure and beautiful in the sunlight. The park next door is a nice green area to walk through.",
          "Most of seeing sights just because it is attractive in Google map or Trip advisor offers the places to visit, but for this one, you should have an Intention. A very historic Structure back to 1953 when the Brussels host the 1958 Brussels \u2026",
          "Massive structure based on atomic structure.  Huge museum inside along with a restaurant at the very top. Definitely worth a visit for the architecture alone...nevermind the history. Great photo op for any would be photographers as well.",
          "This giant sculpture is located well outside of Brussels but very well connected by tram lines.\nIt's located on last terminal stop of couple of trams lines.\nTram line 3 which connects Atomium and runs though Brussels north and Brussels midi \u2026",

          "We didn't realise quite how big and impressive the structure is until we got there! It looks so small on the telly but it is huge and has such great views of the city. Well worth a visit is you go to Brussels! Has some very interesting installations too in some of the spheres.",
          "We were lucky and the day we\u2019ve visited it, an Indian gathering was taking place, with shows and lots of delicious Indian food (which I love), besides that the Atomium is amazing the entire structure the dimensions, very well connected with \u2026",
          "Very impressive structure",
          "you can easily spend a nice day at the Atomium and its surroundings (IMAX 4DX cinema, recreational parks, restaurants...).",
          "The line is long, so I didn't go up into the sculpture. However, it was still nice to see. It's huge! And the adjacent park is nice!",
          "Seems a bit expensive for the value. The view from the top sphere is far from exceptional. It looks stunning from outside though!",
          "Yes it's too big, different architecture.",
          "This is the must to visit place in Brussels. It includes a 'trip' through the history behind the incredible international exibition Expo 58 which was the initiative of creating Atomium monument.",
          "Wow. What a building. Built for expo 1956 but it still looks brand new. I was surprised how big this was. Going out to the top floor viewing platform. It was funny how the most covered everything. After  drink at the bar it started to clear \u2026",
          "Great place to visit in Brussels. Amazing views of the city and very well thought out presentation of it's history. We bought a pass to visit Mini Europe and Atomium.",
          "Nice place to visit if you travel to Belgium. It is something similar to Eiffel but it is a modern tower which depicts science and technology.  You can also visit adjusent parks.",
          "Nice and perfect design. There is a nice park around that and can walking and have a nice time there. You can reach top of that by elevator and stair and have a good view. By bus can reach it so easy.",
          "We went to the Atomium during a long layover. It was definitely worth the trip. But honestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth to go inside, the view from the top is great, but the rest was not really worth going inside.",
          "A landmark in Brussels, Belgium. The top sphere has a restaurant which has a panaromic view of Brussels. It depicts an atomic structure , an unavoidable icon of this place. You can buy or reserve your tickets through online. It has a museum, too.",
          "The place is to be seen for it's amazing structure planted here and also the surrounding natural reserve which is well maintained and really good for nature walks and running or jogging. Only issue which I could see for elderly would be \u2026",
          "Certainly worth a visit. Quite a sizeable attraction  with excellent views once up and inside. Easy to get too. Costs to get inside but worth it for the experience.",
          "A very interesting piece of art! I really loved to take pictures, it is definitely one of a kind! Hope I can come again soon to see it again!",
          "Considerred as symbol of Brussels en Belgium, Atomium is a tourist attraction built for the first post-war universal world exhibition (EXPO 58). The 9 spheres represent an iron crystal magnified 165 billion times. They represent the faith one had in the power of  science and moreover in nuclear power.",
          "The monument is amazing ;)\nIt's just not worth to pay to go inside...you spend hours queuing and is a bit disappointing on the inside",
          "Worth going once",
          "Nice to look at the times when humanity wasn't afraid to think bold and look into the future.",
          "Wonderful monument of Brussels, during summer its really good to visit where the fire crackers event will be conducted on Fridays. And it wonderful eye feast to all i assure for sure.  And lot of food and drinks available ....sometimes DJ  too....",
          "I have loved this piece of Art. You should see It closely !",
          "Nice from the outside,  not much on the inside, wrap your head in foil for the same experience.  View from the top is ok.",
          "Beautiful structure, a must for anyone visiting Brussels!  Interesting to visit the interior, on the highest ball you can enjoy a fantastic view of the surrounding area!",
          "One of the important attractions of Brussels. \nTip - Don't buy food anywhere near the Atomium, they'll Rob you, and the worst part is sub-standard sandwiches.",
          "Very interesting sculpture with good parking very close to it.",
          "Some of the interesting places to visit in Europe. \nJust 30 min. With the train from the city center.",
          "The Atomium was supposed to be a temporary monument, but its success made it the symbol of European capital and a popular tourist attraction. The three outer spheres that are below the top one cannot be accessed. The rest of the spheres contain various attractions and can be accessed. Enjoy your trip!",
          "Very long waiting time, a little expensive for what they offer and you can not enjoy everything because of the crowds that stand next to every important thing.\nWe visit it when it was dark outside and the views are pretty but nothing spectacular neither inside or outside.\nPhotos made outside of atomium look great",
          "Cool spot and easy to get to via city bus or hop-on/hop-off tour bus",
          "Looks amazing from outside, don't think it's worth it to buy tickets to go inside and see the city from the top.\n\nI went in and possibly had to line up for an hour to take the lift to the top to view the city, this was really bad as I \u2026",
          "Initially went for the Pieter Breughel expo, but the whole thing is very interesting, from it's design story construction and uses since. Brilliant views from the top, cool transitions from sphere to sphere and a nice gift shop on the way out.",
          "Worth seeing. The inside observation deck of how and why it was built was interesting. The walk through then consisted of interesting history and an art installation.",
          "Large public monument in the center of an expanse of green space.  The monument is in the shape of an atom and it has become a beloved icon for the city.   Virtually every tour goes by so people can take pictures.  The why is still a mystery to me.",
          "Beautiful place and don't forget for buy a cup of hot chocolate here \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Fantastic iconic place, with an interesting exhibition inside. Adam Design museum included in the ticket",
          "Place kind of splendid to admire, especially by the night. You have to eat in the surrounding restaurants. You would notice some van parked by the side that sells very tasty and nice and delicious waffles. The place is luminescent by the \u2026",
          "Great looking place outside, interior was a little disappointing. The top floor was closed. Overall good place to go, but not inside.",
          "Atomium!! We advanced booked tickets for the 13:00hrs slot. Easy to get to from city centre. It's an impressive sight as you walk down to it passed the tourist attempting their tower of Pisa alternative photo! The lift to the top of the \u2026",
          "Quite impressive for a '1958' structure.You have to get close to realize the actual size of it and it's worth it (for instagram purposes...)\nOne of the main attractions when you visit Brussels(not so much of them though..)\nFrom my point of \u2026",
          "An interesting idea of an iron atom magnified 165 billion times. It was specially build for World Expo in 1958. Out of 9 spheres only 6 is open to the public. The other 3 spheres lack vertical support and due to security reasons are closed \u2026",
          "Another must-see in Brussels. Breathtaking views over the park and the city. Impressive architecture and a great experience to climb inside an iron cristal... Interesting exhibition on the story of its construction.",
          "If we would know the waiting line for the elevator, we wouldn't go. We saw the exhibition which was decent but after seeing that we need to wait at least 1 \u00bdh to go up with the elevator, we quit. Besides paying 15\u20ac, you have to pay some extra to go to the toilet.",
          "Beautiful and unique monument",
          "An interesting landmark of Brussels featuring an observation deck and various exhibitions in the spheres. 15 Euros to get in and the staff are extremely friendly. If you need the toilet it's 60 cents. You also get free admission to the Design museum next door.",
          "Very cool \"building\"! Inside there is a lot of information about how en when it was build and renovated. You can walk through the connections and the atoms.",
          "Superb place to visit... The only thing you need to take care is timing be there before 5 pm.. You will enjoy your trip for sure...",
          "A place to have a feeling like you are inside a big ball made of steel. This place is better to visit during the week days, in which there is no waiting in line or being around with so much tourist. You can also park around the Atomium, but \u2026",
          "The construction is great to see from the outside, but the best lies on top: the view is staggering. I fell in love with the view from up there. Definitely worth it to go up on a sunny day and enjoy the panorama",
          "Peaceful monument visit . Unlike other places",
          "Very interesting place with its escalators, different downstairs, the fastest lift in the world (I guess it still now) and such a wonderful view of the city\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d \nOn the top of it, you will see the city from the all sides and what is more \u2026",

          "It's more impressive from the outside than inside.",
          "Well worth a visit we took the metro but you could also take a tram. The views are amazing and the exhibition is interesting",
          "One of the most iconic things to see in Brussels. Loads of surrounding things to see and places to sit and eat. Even good for picnics.",
          "An impressive structure, though a bit out of the way from down town (accessible by metro). We didn't go inside (read some pretty bad reviews about that experience) but it was still cool to look at from the outside. It does seem a bit out of \u2026",
          "I wasn't impressed in any way by this display. The architecture wasn't ground breaking, not very complex in my opinion. It looks beautiful from the outside and you get excited to go inside to see what it is like but then the display could \u2026",
          "Loved everything about this place except the food \ud83e\udd58 \ud83d\ude2c (They put no work into the food lol) but other than that, my experience there was amazing. Loved the Eiffel tower and the Big Ben there",
          "After the mannequin pis, this is the place that you have to visit in Brussels \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea.\nA museum and unique sculpture made by aluminum and steel, this site represents Belgium steel industry. To be honest, I\u2019m more interested to admire the site \u2026",
          "The Atomium parc is beautiful and a nice place to enjoy during a sunny day. Some of the levels of the Atomium itself were closed when I visited and the only way to get to the top was by the elevator. Spent more time on the line than enjoying the panorama view",
          "Beautiful tourist spot with amazing scenic beauty.",
          "If you are in Brussels it's one of the attractions worth visiting. I would not recommend buying a ticket and going inside. It's more fun to see it from the outside and the nearby park and area is nice to walk around and relax on a sunny day.",
          "Make sure to visit Atomium if you are in Brussels. Try to reach early in the morning if you want to climb to the top - the queues later in the day can be too long. The view from the top is quite good & worth the waiting time. The proper \u2026",
          "Full of information but in a minimalist style - definitely worth a visit",
          "One of the iconic places in Belgium and Brussels! It is a lovely place. Really close to a metro link (station),just a few minutes. There are places to sit and enjoy the stunning view of Atomium! Definitely recommend it!",
          "If you have some spare time during your stay in Brussels, the Atomium is well worth a visit. An incredible sculpture with fantastic views across the city. The only downside is the lack of warning for the strobe lighting on the third level - \u2026",
          "nice place, many things to do and learn. You must to complement the trip day visiting Mini Europe",
          "I like it new idea was established in a creative way",
          "Amazing and huge.. loved this place",
          "Stunning building! Even more so now that it's been renovated and the structure is so shiny. Good to see at night too, though obviously access to it is closed after 6pm.",
          "Interesting structure. Nice to visit in sunny days",
          "There isn't much to see inside it, there aren't many interesting things, the view from the top floor is nice but apart from that there's nothing else to see",
          "This monumental piece of art is one of the most visited places by tourists. Although located in the center of Brussels, there is parking space enough, together with a large green where you can grab some lunch or picknick (and take a lot of \u2026",

          "Definitely worth visitng",
          "Wonderful view of the city from inside, something to enjoy on a sunny day",
          "The place is amazing they built it for the world expo in 1958 and it\u2019s Brussels icon since then",
          "Long queue for going in and then leaving, very poor value for money!!!\n\nNice to walk around but don't go in",
          "We stayed very close to Automium. And has the privilige to visit the Belgium icon. You click some great pictures here. Worth the visit.",
          "Too long queues to go to the top.  Exhibitions were okay. But not too exciting as well. Too crowded and too touristy. But the sculpture or the structure itself is magnificent.",
          "Was more impressive than expected.",
          "A great symbol. Nice museum inside.",
          "Interesting place to visit especially when windy as you can feel it moving when at top",
          "One of my favorite place in brussels.",
          "A bit disappointed. Atomium didn't live up to my expectations. There isn't much to explore within. However, I have to admit that it's a unque structure and contains invaluable historical record.",
          "Great place and nice greeny areas...",
          "Beautiful outside, but not really worth the money to get inside",
          "From out is good but nothing in its just music and light i but 3 stars cuse it new experiences in Brussels",
          "One of a kind monument, must visit in Brussels",
          "Incredible structure, the engineering of it and scale is impressive, and the exhibitions inside are well presented",
          "Very cool place, I 100% would recommend going inside. There was kind of a musical light show in the center one or nucleus I guess. Which was really cool, it's family friendly, and I (without kids) still loved it.",
          "The absurdity of this monumental structure is inticing. It's much bigger than you'd expect. Costs an arm and a leg to go up inside unfortunately but it's cooler to stand at the bottom and marvel at it. From the top it's just another viewpoint.",
          "An amazing site that is definitely worth a visit.",
          "Great customer service.",
          "A huge and beautiful structure at Brussels. Worth visiting . These are actual replication of atomic structure . It's been magnified few a million times that of real atomic structure. Not all but few of the sphere s are available to visit and enjoy the view",
          "Unique view on Brussels. The perspective of birds holds something magic.",
          "For me, this is just something you need to visit because of the history behind the Atomium and the construction. The experience is not that incredible, tough. I was told to take the stairs and make all the visit to the \u201cmuseums\u201d, but I just \u2026",
          "although there was quite a big queue, we got inside the structure easily and fastly. The expositions that were inside were really cool and everything was english subbed. The shop was a bit overpriced, but is kinda expected from such a famous attraction",
          "Great and huge discovering for children.\nSuch a great experience.\nI recommend it .",
          "Much more to do there than I expected!",
          "Very nice and def. worth a visit. The view from the top is magnificent.",
          "It was a wonder experience. A must see when visiting Brussels.",
          "Come and see this as an impressively large scale sculpture. Look at the engineering and wonder how it was designed and built with just paper blueprints. Don't expect to get much of a taste of the 1958 World's Fair, or to enjoy any other \u2026",
          "Interesting structure to look at but doesn't provide much else. The exhibits inside are passable, but not particularly memorable. The view from the top is okay. The top of the structure is quite hot inside and I witnessed another visitor having a vasovagal, which was probably the highlight.",
          "When you enter in Atomium u can explore whole Brussels. On the other hand in Atomium there is a restaurant also and if u want to eat there u needs to reservation before. Beside the Atomium u can see Mini Europe. Atomium and Mini Europe both tickets including 28\u00a3 bt if u r a student then u can get discount.",
          "Amazing master peace created by the Brussels government as the structure was unique and gigantic and lovely place for kids for fun. Very nice place with lot of parking and metro Access.",
          "Most famous tourist attraction in Brussels.",
          "Well maintained building with an interesting architecture. A must visit in Brussels specially on New year's Eve. It's the best view to see the fireworks.",
          "The service in the restaurant is the worst I have ever experienced in my life. We waited a long, long time for drinks. After we had finished we tried to order food but we just waited and waited but none of the staff were interested in \u2026",
          "Beautiful and impressive! A must-see place when you are in Brussels. The inside of atomium and its features are boring and not lively at all. And why do we pay again for using your bathroom? You should know we pay to see and appreciate the \u2026",
          "This place is amazing!! Is you are in Brussels you must come and visit the Atomiun. Try to go in the afternoon so you can see how is at night",
          "Iconic architectural building. You can walk around here. Nice gift shop here.",
          "Looks impressive from the outside, disappointed with the inside. Qued for 1hour 30 to go up in the lift to look out over Brussels then came back down within 10 min. The other floors where very disappointing, lacking variety of language \u2026",
          "Great from outside, quite expencive entry, but very interesting inside.",
          "Weird place! Fun for kids, but otherwise you can skip it. An hour-long wait to get to the top on busy summer days. The other exhibits inside aren\u2019t especially great, though they\u2019re mildly interesting. Little Europe is better.",
          "Wow.. visiting inside was great experience... mini Europe can be seen..bt reservation wasnm needed prior\ud83e\uddd0",
          "You simply haven't been in Europe if you haven't been on top of Atomium and have a cup of coffee there. It's not expensive, so go for it. It's one of the greatest monuments to modern civilisation.",
          "This was a unique experience .. the first level is from where you can get great views of the city. Second and third level are more about how and why is atomium built etc. Last level light and music show was fantastic..kids and us enjoyed \u2026",
          "Good place to visit if you are making a city trip in Belgium. Its next to a lot of parks, cinema and a soccer field of Anderlecht. Sometimes there is firework what is amazing. The only con is that in the restaurant on the top ball are the \u2026",
          "Nothing really special to see and do around, but good place to chill and to feel good vibes. Generally if you are rushing no need to lose hours and to go from the city centre just for this. If you are staying few days its nice to see and to enjoy for example picnic 50m from it.",
          "A bit pricey (eu16 to get in) but a great view of the area and some interesting history and art. Worth seeing once.",
          "Is a very nice place and you must not pay to take photos in the front but inside yes you must pay have a nice day dear.",
          "Great views of Brussels a good way to spend a hour in Brussels",
          "Loved it! Great views, and the declaration of human rights exhibit really gets you thinking about how great liberty and freedom are in our modern world!",
          "It is just a nice place to see",
          "Iconic nine spheres representation of an iron crystal. What a beautiful place. Must visit.",
          "Interesting and wonderful to see. 16.50 per adult was expensive for the entry.",
          "Nice munument of Brussels and I recommend to visit it",
          "Very cool place, a bit further from the city center, though. But it is something special, worth seing in my opinion. I like the night version with all the lights better than during the day, but it is not as convinient for the pic taking then, of course.",
          "Quite expensive as tickets for two people come to \u20ac30. We spent around an hour there. Coffee in the restaurant was good but \u20ac4.50 is quite steep for a cup of latte.",
          "Grand construct of metal, stands out from a great distance. \n\nClearly a tourist attraction, something a once off visit will satisfy for good. \n\nWorth seeing once.",
          "Very nice!",
          "I thought it was really nice but got a little 'seasick' cuz it was kinda stormy and the building moved. Not for real sensitive people but a must see in brussels",
          "Good place to be at New year's. Wish they sort out entry arrangements and transport.",
          "Atomium us a pretty cool place, but the open hours feels pretty short in comparison to how popular it is.\n\nThe line for the elevator to go to the top is very long so expect to have a long wait. U recommend you go there early as you can't \u2026",
          "Stunning monument. Majestic and massive.",
          "The atomium is nice and certainly an eye catcher. However, the area and service are certainly waiting for improvement. Would have been nice to sit down, have some (good) coffee or other drinks.",
          "What a amazing place to see the top of Brussels. The line can get super long so make sure you buy tickets online ahead of time",
          "amazing structure so interesting 5/5 stars",
          "good place to visit and beautiful",
          "It's like a vision of the future from the past.\nAlthough it is still quite futuristic the speculation was wrong, I thought every major European city would have an atomium in the 21st century but sadly no. You have to go to Belgium for all your giant atom needs.",
          "A nice tourist centre.",

          "Cool place, white lots of history",
          "So cool! I didn't know this existed and I came across it while walking around. I love it! People were relaxing and eating ice cream and kids were playing. Nice environment to sit and relax in the awesome chairs they have.",
          "Beautiful place and really worth to see. Be aware that you can't pay by card in the ground floor coffee shop. Come on management, get a card reader, it's 2019!!!",
          "I liked it because it's huge and shiny, and I imagined the impact it had in the 50s... But wouldn't pay the 15 euros to go in again - expositions are cool but you just feel it's a must. As for the view from the top, truth is it isn't that high up and at least for me that was a bummer.",
          "Great place. Brilliant views from the top. Also excellent staff.",
          "Random structure in the middle of nowhere.. pretty disappointing.. looks better at the night",
          "Beautiful sculpture / building. Well worth seeing the inside as well as the outside. The views across the city are beautiful. Capital cities are signposted from top level, including distance which is quite amusing",

          "Great. Always nice to visit while in Brussels",
          "Amazing place to visit... structure of atom in a gigantic form looks amazing. Best way to visit is via train, station is near by and you can just walk upto the huge atom. Be aware there are fixed visiting hours if you want to climb up to \u2026",
          "It's a symbol. In reality it looks the same as in the photos. Go and see it, but don't expect to be swept away. The entrance fee is ridiculously high, there is nothing too impressive to see inside. A hint: might be worth visiting after sunset, because the night illumination is quite fancy.",
          "Exciting and informative with lots of retro items on display to tell the story of the Atomium's origin and its lasting impact on Brussels' identity.",
          "This attraction made Brussels very memorable. It's beautiful, informational, and overall fun. I definitely recommend.",
          "Fantastic spot to visit in Brussels. Adjacent to Mini-Europe and 2 mins walking distance from Metro and Tram station. You can have a view from outside only but to get inner view inside the giant balls of Atomia, entry starts from 1000 hrs \u2026",
          "not kid-friendly by any means. took 25 minutes for family of seven to walk through entire museum. no kid-zone, was closed for no reason. the sign described it as a kids exhibit of beds and mattresses, so not much of a loss there. expensive \u2026",

          "It's beatiful place. I didn't get in because I was come in Saturday (it's crowded because It's saturday night) and I have to go to airport to go back to Berlin. However, it's still interesting to take picture in here",
          "Great views, but the other spheres contents were disappointing. I would have loved to see more on the engineering and construction phase - and the expo of 1958.",
          "This is an amazing structure, very impressive at first, second, thirty, etc... times. I visited it in 2007 and still keep it in my mind. The area where it is located has lots of attractions, so if you are visiting Brussels this is a must see, and you will also be able to visit many other places around.",
          "You can spend your whole day there ita really nice and close to alot of things.",
          "Different,  but well worth it!",
          "165 billion times enlarged structure of atom. Build during cold war, as a way to encourage use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. It a magnificent structure. Do not miss it.",
          "Impressive, well done!",
          "Cool to see so much history from the world expo here.  Nice that it's used as an art gallery as well.",
          "As per many other reviews, it looks great from the outside, particularly at night and the view from the top is pretty good but the exhibits are just a bit too boring. \nWorth a visit if in Brussels",
          "Really nice architecture, but the line was too long to stay to go inside. The line for the entrance in the museum, not the waiting line for tickets.",
          "Outside is much better than inside",
          "Highly recommend for groups of friends, families, and couples, the Atomium offers everyone something: history buffs, aesthetes, exercise, and cool light shows. Can be conveniently accessed by metropolitan train. Is nearby a large park and the miniature Europe exhibit.",
          "one of the good scientific Monument",
          "Atomium, it's a famous place in Brussels - Belgien, a nice place to visit, it's a cinema beside to all family, it's a big parking to your car.",
          "Easyy accessible and you can find everything\nTher and also you can inspired all Europe",
          "Worth the money spent! We loved it. It had a Sci fi movie feel interiors with lot of history on Belgium and EU. The view from inside is also pretty impressive",
          "Its far better than expected. This massive thing has something special about it. Plus the exhibitions are really good. Only fault is the queue  of people waiting for the elevator to get to the top. (maybe open some stairs so people have option of different route if they choose so)",
          "8,50 \u20ac ticket for atomium. And close to 17 \u20ac ticket for atomium and mini Europe. But temporarily closed until March 14, 2020.",

          "Life time Memorable experience on the new year 2020 eve, spectacular light and sound show",
          "We were introduced to shorter version of trip so all of activities took around 20 minutes total. Nice view and story that is told inside is a nice day thing to participate in. Other than that- meh.",
          "It's the Identical symbol of Belgium. You can visit outside without ticket, but If want to inside you have buy ticket. In inside it's really nice to see.",
          "It's interesting to go see it. However, depending on your interests, it becomes boring quite quickly. There isn't much to do aside from looking at the sculpture and paying for extremely over priced snacks at the cafe (2 popsicles 6euro... that's insane)",
          "Went there on a class trip and it has nothing to do with science. Overall very boring and overpriced. What I liked was the view from inside the sculpture and the size of it. There was also a really cool light show in 2 of the rooms but that does not justify the price at all.",
          "A must see for anyone visiting Brussels, as it is one of several representative monuments of the city. You cannot avoid being pleasantly surprised by how well they adapted to the current times with lights, music and the overall impression. \u2026",
          "The Atomium is a landmark building in Brussels (Belgium), originally constructed for the 1958 Brussels World Expo (Expo 58). It is located on the Heysel Plateau, where the exhibition took place. It is now a museum.\n\nDesigned by the \u2026",
          "Was good experience but for the content we get for the price is not justified could be bit cheaper. Most of the area are like photo museum just filled with photos of construction. The top view and light stairs was good.",
          "Great place to go in Brussels. Modern art in the different balls and good views from above. All the food trucks around only take cash. Best to get there with the metro near by.",
          "Too expensive for what you get. The structure is cool thou",
          "It was okay. I had to wait for a long time to get to the upper levels. The elevators can't take more than 6 to 10 people at a time. Once you're up there, the view isn't special. Brussels doesn't have a skyline or other nice things to look at. The service is very good, friendly people and you get your drink fast.",
          "Breathtaking views from top, one must visit to experience it. Camera won\u2019t do the justice.",
          "A must seen attraction of Brussels. Even if it is already closed or you can't afford entry ticket. You still can go to the park, see it, and take some amazing photos.",
          "It's awesome to be around but at the time the line was insanely long.",
          "Famous spot in Brussels and worth of visit \nTruly architecture piece",
          "Went there before sunset, it was a lovely time spent. Not too busy on a chilly December evening.",
          "Unique architecture of Belgium nearby Brussels . You have to go by metro train a bit less than 1 hour.",
          "It was ok, nothing much to do. We went up the tower. Exhibition was fine but nothing really interesting.",
          "Very impressive and grand sculpture/structure but quite far from the city centre coupled with horrendous queues to buy tickets for entry and more queues to enter the building itself. Very pricey and not entirely worth the money unless \u2026",
          "Great to visit, went first to the top with the elevator to see the views and then visited the lower galleries. Great experience for all ages.",

          "Fantastic fireworks. Really good night and great atmospheres",
          "Pretty far out. Have a cafe that sells $4 beers at the base \ud83d\ude09",
          "Greatest Belgian landmark. Must see when you visit Belgium.  Cool construction.",
          "I would actually give five stars but the most concerning thing was the lack of information or advice provided for people who suffer from flash and strobe lighting. There is led laser like lighting display in one of the spheres but no notice \u2026",
          "What an amazing structure! Pictures don't do it justice and the film of the construction is really interesting - long before health and safety came on the scene! Only slight quibble was the queue management could have been better but the views from the top are worth the wait.",
          "A nice place to see Brussels from the top though it isn't too high (only 92 m high). But the architectural design of the building is amazing!",
          "Super crowded, Better to plan in advance",
          "Awesome historical info and also a suprising amount of beautiful artwork",
          "I didn't think that the atomium is that huge. 102 meter(tall) \nYou will be completely impressed by the design. They offer a lot of stuff to see:\nThe panoramic view, the permanent exhibition of the atomium and some other side exhibitions, a  little restaurant and a souvenir shop.",
          "Unfortunately on our visit, Brussels was experiencing a record heat wave so we decided to avoid the heat in the spheres. Otherwise, the parks and other attractions were great to visit.  Will definitely come back again",
          "We was not able to go inside as was closed due to the annual maintenance. Around atomimum you can find a cafe who is selling sandwiches as well and is a good place to stay for a coffe if is to cold outside  . Next to anatomium you can find also a park with a small lake . .relaxing",
          "Not a great tour experience ,but the structure is an awesome view",
          "Loved walking on the near park.",

Also you have mini-Europe quite close, you can buy a ticket and enter both places so you can experience the best of the zone.",
          "This was absolutely amazing to see. You could see it from very far away and once you got close up it was unbelievable. Definitely a must place to go to. If ever in Brussels, bring the family to Atomium. They will love it.",

But IT IS SOOOOO WORTH IT. I love it! People were relaxing and eating ice cream was great. There are kids in the back as well and gives a great atmosphere",

Don't know if there is anything worth going inside for because we thought it was not with the 15\u20ac entrance fee.

          "Too crowded during the holidays but a nice piece of masterwork!",
          "Panaromic observatory had quite mediocre view and was poorly air conditioned. The exposition has its value as a historical museum, but it was also not astonishing in my humble opinion. Maybe I understand too much math/science to be so inspired by its geometry or design.",
          "Loved it. It's modelled in the shape of an iron atom. It costs a couple of euros of you wish to climb. Beautiful place to take lots of nice pictures",

          "This was a really cool landmark to check out. It's worth queueing to get to the top first so you can see the views over Brussels, then make your way back down to the other exhibits. There is a light show in one of the zones which is really \u2026",
          "It\u2019s kind of an overrated monument in my opinion. The symbolism attached to it, however, is very interesting. It marks a new age in Europe. Don\u2019t really think it\u2019s worth paying to get in but that\u2019s up to you. If you\u2019re with friends be ready to squat down to take their pictures because the thing is just huge!!",

Atomium bu itself it\u2019s quite interesting, although the student price for ticket is alright, normal ticket is quite expensive as the number of attractions there is not big.",

          "Even more beautiful in person! I've been meaning to visit this place for a long time and finally got to see it!",
          "Even if you aren't a fan of World's Fair history the Atomium is amazing to see in person. It's very close to the Heysel metro station and next door to Mini-Europe. This is a must see!",
          "Very impressive structure from 1958 Exposition Universelle. The outside looks impressive. The inside is pretty boring especially for kids. We did not queue for the lift to take us to the very top as we had to wait 1 hour. Shame they don\u2019t allow people to walk. Not everything was",
          "I saw this place in the summer. It was a week day so the lines were not too long. There were some school kids also. It is an interesting place with lots of elevators and some kind of 60- 70s atom age look. It is an old building but it is lovely. Building of the Atomium",
          "They are very unclear about there being no access to the topmost sphere unless you queue for the elevator. This makes no sense at all as there are 3 other potential routes to the top sphere. It's a bit of a mess and a bit of a con as they don't mention this at any stage. Nice",
          "it is the kind of gimmick that you don't know what you are getting into. the view is nice, other than that, it is pretty boring.",
          "Considering the Atomium was built in 1958 it is amazing, a truly different day out, and worthy of your time. Admission includes entry to a nearby exhibition of design.",
          "I enjoyed seeing the structure from the outside and the history behind it. It certainly is an architectural wonder. However, the interior was disappointing. Very little of interest to me, however, I think the children enjoyed the escalators and ability to run around. If you",
          "We didnt realise quite how big and impressive the structure is until we got there! It looks so small on the telly but it is huge and has such great views of the city. Well worth a visit is you go to Brussels! Has some very interesting installations too in some of the spheres.",
          "It is hot, humid, the sun is on top of you and you are walking outside in Brussels... That is exactly what we were doing going to the Atomium. I missed it the first time I was in Brussels, but this time that was not the case. If you are looking for an activity this is a very",
          "Great for a short visit. Nice view of the city from the top. Gift shop is very expensive for cheap stuff.",
          "We took the hop on bus round the city, it was a rainy day but we stayed at the Atomium for a while ,lots to see and do, lots of queuing for tickets though.",
          "The lift takes you straight up to the top, and when you get there, it's a pretty cool view to take in. I took some artsy (well, my standard of artsy shots) and took in the view. However, this didn't take long to do. Now I should stress at this point I'm very much a travel for",
          "wonderful Engineering master piece design... it is not just a memorial structure but also combination of science and engineering...",
          "Was obviously looking forward to visiting such an iconic Brussels attraction but was not that impressed. From the outside spectacular. Inside is just one big queue.The only way to the top is by lift so queueing for an hour is the only option.And as queues go this is a very",
          "The last time I had been there was in the 1970s and the exhibit has changed in certain ways as well as tha parts that are accessible.",
          "What an amazing quirky place. Took a little while to get started by going up in the lift but once underway, what a great tour. Absolutely fascinating",
          "Walked to the atomium on a sunny saturday through the outskirts of Brussels. It's a great piece of iconic architecture but very busy when we were there. We did the exhibition but were not prepared to queue for over 60 minutes to get to the viewing platform which was a",
          "15 euro admission gets you a decent visit. My teens enjoyed it. Line to take the lift to the top was very long so we skipped it. Cheap, yummy waffles available on site. Lots of parking available. Train/Metro is easily accessible.",
          "We stopped at the Atomium on our tour. It was a very quick stop and very rainy. Wish we had time to go inside. Very beautiful.",
          "Came to see the Atomium unsure whether we would go in but really enjoyed the trip. There are some really lovely views from the top and got some great photos. Tip: go in the afternoon and stay until it starts to get dark and the whole structure is lit up",
          "The Atomium is a great place to check out when in Brussels. You can take the subway all the way there, and quite early there was not a long queue to get in. I guess the view from the top is good, but we had fog so going to the top wasn't so exiting. But the monument is still",
          "Atomium, Brussels Belgium :-. The Atomium is a landmark building in Brussels, originally constructed for the 1958 Brussels World Expo (Expo 58). It is located on the Heysel Plateau, where the exhibition took place. It is now a museum. All the Physics experiments are performed",
          "Was for sure impressive from the outside and a little less so inside. My kids loved it, though. Had a 14.12 and 10 year old in row and they enjoyed going inside!",
          "Had visions of these immersive experiences in each of the globe-like rooms. This is not the case. It is a series of lifts, stairs and escalators to a number of half-baked exhibitions in each. Really not worth the admission fee. The view at the very top is okay, probably better",
          "My husband, adult daughter and I visited Brussels recently. She is a bit of a science geek and wanted to do the Atomium. The science information is really good reading. However, there is not much else to the visit. There are no activities, etc. just viewing and reading the",
          "Queue for tickets was chaotic and well out of the ticket hall down to the road. Just two people selling tickets and we eventually found out the main lift wasn't working so couldn't go to the top. So having got that out of the way we started to explore. The lift sprang in to life",
          "For some reason, I was not aware of this marvelous structure in Brussels. Amazing architecture remains from World's Fairs and this is not exxception. Lots happening here. You can go in the Atomium or visit the museum or just hang out on the grounds. there was live music and",
          "Cost money to get in, I think I paid \u20ac25-28 for Mini Europe and Atomium. It was packed and we could not get in queue for the top floor via elevator (or maybe you have to pay extra). I didn\u2019t feel comfortable after the 4th floor because it started to feel cramped and I was just",
          "Huge structure in Brussels, larger than I thought. A bit far from Downtown. The design is WOOOOW! A good place to visit while in Brussels.",
          "I suppose lots of people goes to Bruxelas and don\u2019t visit de atomium, because it is not near the center of the city. Don\u2019t take that mistake. If you go to bruxells don\u2019t loose that visit, it will astonishing you.",
          "Didn\u2019t know about this before and I feel very foolish. There was a lot to see, history, art the view. An absolute must on a trip to Brussels!",
          "We enjoyed going to the Atomium and the surrounding grounds. However, the queue was long to get into the lift and stairs were closed. Didn't go up as was too much money for a short period of time.",
          "A long line to buy a ticket. Finally our turn and hurray, we get a 4 euro discount because the elevator was broken. Even 11 euros is too much money for an old-fashioned exhibition. The upper sphere, the one with a view, can only be reached by elevator. No stairs as an",
          "The Atomium was fun to visit, the view was nice and there were some cool stairs and exhibitions. We did not get the Combi-ticket to mini europe, since it only saved about 2 euro per ticket. With the ticket to the Atomium comes a ticket into the Adam design museum as well.",
          "Without a doubt the sight of the Atomium as you approach it is unique. Not many expected this to be such a hit when it was built for the 1958 Expo...still standing and attracting attention, what a unique place! There was a Bruegel exhibition inside as a bonus too :-)",
          "Is a nice place outside the city, all around is very nice but the atomium is a unique experience because is not empty ;)",
          "The construction is wonderful! It\u2019s worth to be seen. But inside is really boring and not updated. But the vue is nice. I\u2019m",
          "We loved everything about Brussels... except this monumental tourist trap. Even if you are a science fiend (one of us was), this place was garish and awkward and miserably over crowded. We wish we had spent the time sitting in a cafe or listening to music in St Gilles. Hard",
          "Atomium is probably best from the outside. If you decide to go inside, please skip the restaurant. Over-priced food and incredibly rude waiters.",
          "If it hadn't been for the exhibition that was on at the time I would have rated the actual experience 2 stars because it is hugely overpriced for an 'experience' that lasts about 20 minutes max. You queue for agesss. Something to do once but definitely not again!",
          "Amazing view from the observatory, inexpensive tickets, kind staff. Highly recommendable destination.",
          "Iconic and it deserves to be... beautiful from both outside and inside. Beautiful observatory from top level and few exhibitions and museum at lower level What really striking is the slanted stairs/ elevators for going from one sphere to another One can club the visit",
          "We stopped on our Hop On - Hop Off bus tour. This is an interesting place to look back and remember old world exhibitions. We didn\u2019t buy tickets to the \u2018mini-Europe\u2019 - it looked a bit cheesy so we took a pass and can\u2019t comment on that!",
          "It's something that u will enjoy looking at from a few yards away..the entry fee for getting inside is also pretty expensive. Nothing much to do here.",
          "The Atomium is a super-sized Iron crystal built as the symbol of the 1958 Brussels World's Fair. It is kept dazzlingly clean and bright on the outside. On the inside is a fascinating museum that takes you back to that time and is packed with information on then-current events",
          "We saw it from the airplane flying and decide that we had to see it. It didn't disappoint. It feels very futuristic when you are there.",
          "Its an interesting sculpture, funny's to see. Little more. You can visit quite fast. If you're visiting Brussel its a very popular attraction.",
          "My family and I loved the Atomium visit. My young girls were amazed with its architecture and shape. Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t enter it as there was a long queue ahead of us but we enjoyed it so much that we will come again and try entering it!",
          "More for kids than adults on the exhibition side. Waiting time not for kids.... much too long Explanation in the elevator rather short and not interesting From top floor - after one hour and half waiting time is happily worth it even by night. This said not sure it is a must",
          "This was on my list of things to see when I visited Brussels, and it really is worth going to see! The tour inside was a little underwhelming but cheap and interesting for the most part. Would reccomend!",
          "Overall it is probably 'must see' place. Just because of uniqueness. 1 hour if you will really curious about building history - there are some materials to look and read. Forget about interactive exposition. Points: 1. Do not be fooled. Exposition here is pretty boring and goes",
          "Great photo opportunities especially from the top. Worth a visit. It is not a science museam. Some art on show and history about the atomium.",
          "An amazing structure from the outside with good photo opportunities but worth the time and money to visit the inside? Possibly not. Lots of people with an inadequate queuing system, taking far too long to see not a lot. We gave up waiting for the lift to go to the very top. Do",
          "Good attraction afor Belgium which not many things you can see here, nice secnery with beau landscaping around,,",
          "This is an interesting structure for sure, and the idea around human rights is still or even more valid today. The line was long and the view just ok, quite expensive for what you get",
          "Fascinating structure with lots going on inside. You get some great views of the city, and there is a nice restaurant/bar up top, and though its a little crowded, the bar staff are helpful a friendly. The exhibition space was terrific and was showing a cool light and sound",
          "Very nice place to see, a little far from the center but worth to visit. Beautiful view of the whole of Brussels, also the restaurant is there on the top.",
          "There was a long queue for the tickets inside the entrance. When you finally get inside you first visit the 'museum' where you can see the old pictures from years when it was under construction plus a few artifacts (not related to atomium at all). All that takes about an hour",
          "As a museum it was not that great. But as a building and engineering at was fantastic. Make sure you have enough time.",
          "We visited the Atomium briefly while on the tour bus. It stopped just beneath it so we were able to see it quite closely. We didn\u2019t have time to get off the bus and visit inside, but we were told it was quite interesting to see.",
          "This place is very interesting and worth visit. It is the identity of Brussels. It is an excellent place for those who are interested in Arts, Science and architecture. I enjoyed each moment in the atomium and wanted to go there often.",
          "i enjoyed the fries at the near by eatery more than my walk around this crapy toy park... This place is a typical tourist trap. i may have enjoyed this place if they had a few lines or an audio guide about each building.",
          "Well worth the trip on it's own really, quite incongruous but that made it better! Tip is to book tickets first as queue for them can be longer than to get up to the top.",
          "1 word 3 letters wow Magnificent sighting. A must to get done is your free Panaromic selfie! Truly incredible",
          "In my opinion, is the second best view of Brussels. The first one is at the top of parc du Mon Des arts. The entrance is 15euros. There is an option to buy mini europa + atomium, but once you get at the top, you can seen the mini Europe. It is impressive by the time it was",
          "Great landmark near one of the royal palaces. The structure of the metal monument is stunning and the sight really takes your breath away. Easy to reach by public transport.",
          "Have been there a couple of times and like it every time. Buying the ticket is worth it, if you go through it completely. You can also go to the design museum for free when buying a ticket. It is a good idea to come during sunset and stay until it is dark.",
          "We took an Uber from the Center going here. Good thing that this is nearby Mini Europe which I've enjoy more that this site. Even with the elevator/escalator you need to climb stairs to fully explore the place, Not for someone that has mobility problem. Its just really a good",
          "Takes a little while to get there by metro from the city center, but it's an impressive and beautiful monument. If you are willing to pay to get inside you will find an amazing view at the top and a cool exposition !",
          "Much bigger than might be imagined, the top sphere had an observation deck and a restaurant with views over Brussels reached by a lift. Other spheres have exhibitions and it sits in a park which has mini Europe world and the King Baudouin (Heysel) football stadium. Worth a",
          "I just wanted to see the place having heard everyone talk about it, took a tram to the place and such a beauty. I could not get the influence to such design but it is out of the world beauties.",
          "Built in 1958, this iconic structure is stiil an amazing modern piece of architecture. Views were stunning",
          "Far better from the outside than inside. This really is a great place to take photos and play around with angles. The permanent displays inside are also interesting telling the story about the history of the building and the 1950's. Unfortunately the current pop up exhibition of",
          "The exhibition centre and the Atomium are impressive locations Was the during the Busworld 2019 where we exhibited and had test drives with our electric bus",
          "It's bigger than expected, even tho I didn't get in because it was overpriced, is still worth to check out the outside.",
          "Can\u2019t say much about this place other than it was beautifully light up at night. I didn\u2019t walk around or tour the place. We literally drove around to snap a couple pictures.",
          "This sculpture is stunning on a glorious day. It is surrounded by well manicured gardens, making it perfect for holiday photos.",
          "We went to the Atomium, but didn't go into it. Amazing feat of engineering from the outside. I read online that it isn't bood if you have fear of heights, and after taking one look at it, I was sure that reviewer was correct.",
          "Worth a visit, a different exhibition in every sphere and the top one houses a family friendly restaurant with great views!",
          "My husband and I visited the Atomium while we were in Brussels visiting. However we didn\u2019t pay to actually enter and enjoyed the view from the outside. We didn\u2019t feel like it was worth the price or the line for us-however if we\u2019d had our son with us we likely would\u2019ve paid then",
          "We visited this local attraction while we were doing the hop on hop off bus tour . This is a stunning attraction and gives you fantastic views over the city . There are several sections to explore and lots of opportunities to learn more about the structure and history ..well",
          "Went with the family and climbed to the top. The audio- visual show and exhibits were great. It\u2019s a structure ahead of its time. It\u2019s a must see in Brussels",
          "Definitely an impressive structure from the outside. We had to queue for over an hour as everyone had to go up in the lift. Not all the pods were open as the exhibition that was on at the time of our visit wasn\u2019t extensive. We thought it was worth a visit but perhaps expected",
          "It is very easy to find just got into train and this place is worth a visit and more attractions for kids near the atimium.",
          "Stopped there to take photos but we did not go in as you have to line up, pay quite a bit and it looked slightly run down. To get a view on Brussels I recommend the view on the city from the Palais de Justice - it is free!",
          "Wow, the Atomium is huge and, though we only viewed it from the hop on, hop off tour bus, it is beautiful! I would love to return and visit the museum someday!",
          "From the center of Brussels to Atomium can be visited by subway (Atomium near the train station at Heizel). The purpose of visiting one of the characteristic buildings in the city of Brussels is to fulfill the curiosity of the shape and appearance of the Atomium building. It",
          "A must for the tourist.....accessible....fascinating museum, retro excellence... great views. Reasonable price....need to book the restaurant.",
          "This is a visually pleasing place to visit. 14 euros to enter. You have to leave bags in the lockers by the ticket office so have a spare Euro coin. Best to get the metro on line 6 to Heysel, then a short walk to the site.",
          "A nice quiet mid-week visit on a sunny day. Good views from the top, but full of children and very sub-standard exhibits which can support schools trips. The advertised Breughel exhibition was only display boards. The free entry to the Adam design museum is a waste of time.",
          "We had the social event of a meeting there. Nice guided tour. Good typical Belgian catering. Good acoustics. Some elements lift you back to the 50-ties and 60-ties in a nice way.",
          "it's a cool structure, but it is expensive to go in if you don't have a student discount. I think it was 15 euro for entry. inside is a museum but it's not very great but the panoramic view at the top was cool.",
          "It is much largest in person than what the pictures reflect. This location has several festivals as well. There were long lines for tickets to go inside, online early purchase is recommended. The inside is escalators to go throughout. There are Few food vendors close by as",
          "The atomium is amazing and a feat of engineering. The view from the top is incredible with the boards telling you where you are facing and what is in that direction. The other 'rooms' have other exhibits in them, some are seasonal and others are more about the building of the",
          "If you have time well worth a visit. Very interesting and some great views of the city. Would imagine it gets very busy in the summer. You would either need to drive to get to it or use the Metro as a little of of Brussels.",
          "The place is very nice for a visit but, they do not give as much attention as the place needs, and the area around has dry grass without nice decoration !!",
          "Gigantic atom made of steel. Cool to see how huge it is and you feel so tiny. The parks and surrounding area is quite beautiful. Then we went to the Grand Place of Brussels and saw a replica in Godiva chocolate.",
          "Booked a combo ticket for atomium, adam museum and the mini Europe. The atomium is a huge structure with 9 atoms. Once inside we climbed to the top in an elevator. The view of the city was spectacular from here. Then there were these passages from one ball to another through",
          "Nice and different museum, a reminiscence on the times long past, when the huge world fairs were usual and grand. It also reminded me that Belgium was one of the colonial powerhouses.",
          "Well worth the visit on a sunny day. Can go to top in elevator. Other spheres you must walk between.",
          "Most visited modern structure in Brussels. Its gigant and amzing. when you stand under its huge globe, may feel like you are not in the earth.",
          "This was really much better and bigger than I had expected. You just don't realize how big it is from a distance. We stopped and watched workers on ropes hang from the top structure and clean it with large brushes. We had a very nice sunny day to stroll around the area and",
          "Terrific place to visit while in Brussels. A unique place and interesting to learn the history of the Atomium and the 1958 World Exposition.",
          "I was expecting more for the price, the lift ride is quite nice, the view from top as well but the exhibitions is for really people who are into this, pretty boring for the kids (10,12) we ticked a box, done, not again",
          "The Atomium is a monument located in the Heysel park in Brussels. It is a steel construction that represents the 9 atoms of a unitary cell of an iron crystal: a reference to the sciences and uses of the atom, important themes and in full development at the time.",
          "Impressive structure... looks great dominating the skyline. We visited on a rainy day so we may have found the inside underwhelming as views were obstructed by mist. All felt a bit \"conveyor belt\" and probably spent longer in queues than at the exhibits. That said, it should be",
          "This impressive structure was originally designed and constructed for the 1958 World Fair in Brussels.It is very impressive and symbolizes an atom. It is a very popular site to visit and I can highly recommend it.",
          "The best about Atomium is its view. On one of the floors they show short film abt how it was constructed. It has a mix of lift, elevators and steps, so b prepared to walk a bit whilst climbing down. Mini Europe looks so beautiful from aerial view. We bought combo ticket which",
          "The atomic symbol for iron that is left over from the 1958 worlds fair. A good tourist attraction. You can go in but don\u2019t plan on spending a lot of time at this one site.",
          "It\u2019s just a short distance from the city proper. You\u2019ll get s sprawling view of Brussels. Temperature was a little on the high side but the cool breeze and the relaxing atmosphere put everything into a positive perspective.",
          "It is an iconic structure and famous so it is definitely worth a visit to click pictures however i would recommend skipping going to the top if you are pressed for time. There aren\u2019t any interesting exhibits nor any beautiful view that warrants the entry fee as well as long wait",
          "This place is really awesome being over 60 years old.Atom and Aluminum combined, they call it Atomium eventhough the out side shell is stailess steel now. Impressive place",
          "Beautiful landmark! You can buy tickets to go inside and view from the observatory. It\u2019s not necessarily impressive from the inside but it\u2019s quite cool to view from the outside.",
          "We visited with myself, husband, 15 year old daughter, and 20 year old son. While my son thought it was interesting, my daughter was bored. I definitely felt it was something to see while visiting Brussels. Not sure how exciting it would be for younger kids or teenagers.",
          "Fantastic Structure specialized for Brussels.Waiting time so long either you book tickets in advance or not. The music and the lighting system add more enjoyable environment. Its a must see during visit to Brussels. Not accessible by TRAM and need to take Train.",
          "This is definitely a blast from the past piece. It\u2019s nothing extraordinary from the inside. You can go in to see the view of the city. After that - the other levels isn\u2019t anything interesting. Save some time & go sightseeing nearby & the city.",
          "Loved visiting this !! It was built in the 1950\u2019s for the world expo. We went on a Saturday morning very small queue for tickets which were reasonable in price with a reduced price for seniors. We enjoyed the trip around the Atomium via lifts and escalators. There were some",
          "What a fantastic place. Great views from the top, very informative in the different areas inside. Located a 5 minute walk from the Hazel metro station. The ticket also gives entry to the ADAM museum a short walk away.",
          "not worth visiting the atomium. Better stay in Brussels to enjoy the view. Nothing to visit ... long journey in metro to arrive there. to forger",
          "I enjoyed my visit to the Atomium. Please be aware that except for the top ball that you can access for the panoramic view, by high- speed elevator, the other exhibition spaces all require a combination of escalators or stairs to climb or descend. At times, you will take an",
          "A truly huge amazing structure. Not really worth going inside. The tickets were not expensive, the view was so so. The problem is a 30 minute queue. A small lift will take only a few people up at a time. Once you reach the top it is small, and quite warm. Then there is a",
          "Nice view from the top, but the staff at the ticket office was not very professional. No \u2018hello\u2019 or \u2018thank you\u2019, just a cold \u201chow many people\u201d then handed the receipt over. He looked as if he hated being there.",
          "The structure is a bit larger than I expected and impressive to look at as you approach it. The view from the top is good, as you would expect. The exhibitions in the spheres were mixed, I found the one about the history quite interesting whereas the pop-up art exhibition",
          "We may not have gone up to any of the spheres but looking at the overall structure amazed me. I can just imagine a structure with 9 huge stainless spheres measuring 60 ft. in diameter and connected by 20 tubes is resting on just 3 pillars! You should see this to believe.",
          "This is a must! It is amazing. I couldn't go inside but they say is awesome too. You can take great pictures of this biiiig iron atom",
          "Yes. I did go to the Atomium and mini Europe close to it.They are worth visiting once you are in Brussels. I also recommend Train word museum wich is really great.",
          "Seeing it from the outside was kind of neat, but the cost to go up, the long waiting in a line inside (on a warm day with no air conditioning) made for an unpleasant experience. Snap a picture from outside and save your money.",
          "Long metro ride for me to get there. Often considered a must see when in Brussels. Well organized inside tour. Interesting place of visit. Good photo ops.",
          "It's a great place to go whether you just wanna take pics from outside or go inside and enjoy the panoramic view from the top floor and history of the place. We didn't encounter long queues when we were visiting, but if you're worried, you can book tickets online a couple of",
          "We did not go inside, as the queues were very long (both at the ticket booth and inside, at the elevator. The gift shop is quite expensive, as is the cafe (better value food is available from mobile outlets nearby). The structure itself is very impressive and worth a visit,",
          "After our tour of Mini Europe we went to the Atomium which was just a few metres away. There are combi-tickets available covering both the attractions. The atomium, a huge stainless steel structure of 9 domes, is a place from where (topmost dome)one gets a 360 degree view of",
          "Our Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour #1 from Central Train Station in CBD Brussels stopped here and would be an easy time-efficient way to fully explore this wonder site. It sure makes a fabulous skyline statement.",
          "It's a nice tourist attraction and a scientific mark where you can learn the atomic structure of Science. Famous place in Belgium",
          "Best view of the city from the top. A must see building and good to combine with mini Europe right next door",
          "I would equate the Atomium to the Eiffel Tower. Both built for the World's Fair with a nice park to relax and admire the structures. It's fun to take pictures and walk around the unique \"building\"",
          "Had a good time walking around this place. We did not go in the Atomium but had a good stroll admiring this structure. There even was the option for a free panorama photo in front of it.",
          "We were on a guided tour of Brussels from our cruise ship berthed in the port of Zeebrugge. After spending much of the day in the inner city, our tour coach made a stop in a carpark adjacent to the Atomium. There was not enough time available for us to tour this strange",
          "From 1958, this structure looks amazing, has an elevator to the top for incredible views, a restaurant and bar, and connecting escalators on the way down through the 45 degree tubes. Brilliant!",
          "Have been to Brussels many times but have never been to the atomism until now. We took some friends over and they really enjoyed it. Reasonably priced and can combine ticket with mini Europe- review to follow. Also if you use the city sightseeing hop on hop off bus you get a",
          "It is an interesting place to visit. Your Brussels card gives a 2.50 Euro discount. An Elevator takes you to the top Sphere with excellent views all around. The resturant is a BIG RIP OFF very expensive and not great food. The elevator will bring you down to mid level sphere on",
          "Not very well maintained building and quite expensive tickets. There must be some reparations like the escalators -they don t sound good at all, there is some rust here and there, cables..",
          "Fantastic place to visit and it really is worth the trip out of town to do this. We took the metro and it is about 30mins (cost 7.50 euro each for an all day ticket). Get out at Heizel and walk down as this will give you the best view to take a photo of the structure. Plan to",
          "We visited here because you can\u2019t visit Brussels without going to the Atomium. We actually loved the structure and it\u2019s presence on the sky line. I did think the spheres were a little small when you were inside though but that is a personal thing. There were two highlights to",
          "I loved the architecture it's really shocking in the right way \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d if you're looking for a good place it's totally the right one",
          "This is an impressive gigantic structure built for the 1958 exhibition. You can see it from very far away. It is located away from the city center in a park. It is impressive to see as one approaches you can walk from bottom of boulevard and admire the different perspectives as",
          "Myself, my husband and my 14 year old son visited the atomuim on our recent visit to Brussels. Cost us about 40euros to get in and the views from the top were incredible. The history of the build and the light shows inside even amazed my son. Well worth the visit. Only down",
          "It is very interesting to see it from ouside and to take photos, but if you don't have time to go inside, don't be sad, you cannot go in all the balls.",
          "Took the Metro from Brussels Centraal station to Brussels Midi. Changed to #6 metro line and take to Heizel stop. Walk approximately 5-10 minutes through parking lot to Atomium. I took pictures from the outside (free). I did not go into the Atomium.",
          "I went to the atomium expecting to learn more about chemistry, but what I got is a description of the monument. The view from the top is nice but not breathtaking. Still a nice place to visit in the spare time.",
          "It's Brussels' Post Card, I think the building is a great structure, beautiful to take pics, an awesome design, but the place around is really poor, without grass or sidewalk, i went there in a rainny day, and it was really sloppy and muddy. That's the reason I feel it don't",
          "t! I think it\u2019s brilliant, so good to be able to go to the top. Some tips though, there is a lift shaft that takes you to the top but make sure to take the stairs /escalaters to experience the other viewing galleries that are within the atoms. For elderly, there\u2019s only 2",
          "We have walked past this tall shiny structure from our bus parking lot to the center of town, unfortunately, I did not have time to go in.",
          "Had no idea what to expect on the inside but was blown away. They merged technology, history, music and lights, which made for a great experience. The views were amazing at all of the different levels.",
          "Loved our visit here .... a definite must do! Quick elevator up to top for great views and photos over Brussels then down to lower floors for exhibitions . Please note at tickets you are cheaper with the combo ticket for Atomium and Mini Europe and that ticket also gets you",
          "It is impressive and next to it you will find great museums. Mini Europe is also a few steps away from Atonium. You must go inside and get into all floors. We had great views from inside and great place to visit.",
          "Very interesting to visit and learn about the original expo and the building of the Atomium. The temporary exhibition was also nice with a soumd and light show. Dont expect a long visit but do expect a long line to visit the panoramic view at the top. Requires going up some",
          "The minute you see this structure at the end of the street you are facinated! Each ball is the locale of another exhibit within the structure itself. The park and grounds surrounding Antomium are beautiful too.",
          "Some spheres contained a history of Atomium. They weren't interesting and felt as if someone wanted to put something so as not to leave empty space \u2013 it didn't work. Two spheres contained a cyberpunkish 90s styled sci-fi movie light shows \u2013 I enjoyed those very much, spending",
          "Went yesterday in the burning sun - honestly one of the best tourist attraction I have been to - blown away - from the outside beautiful and timeless - built in the 50s - but still looks undated - inside - the views from the top are incredible - then the rest of the tour ( you",
          "Very interesting and great theatrics. Not for people who can\u2019t climb stairs. Downside was waiting in a long line to take the elevator to the top.",
          "Impressive from the outside, the symbol of Bruxelles is disappointing from the inside perspective, in relation to the ticket price and, above all else, time spent in line for the elevator to reach the top floor, at least one hour.. Would be worth it for the Galleria degli",
          "I have been here! For who, like me has studied in the past century, this building is amazing, astonishing and wonderful. I think that as well all the incredible buildings built after the 2nd WW also this you do not miss it.",
          "Wow, who would ever have thought to see something like this in Brussels. A left over from a world fair over 40 years ago. It is something to see! Well worth the detour off the highway.",
          "We stopped at the Atomium as part of the City Sightseeing hop on/off bus tour. It cost 13 euros (getting 2 euros discount showing our bus ticket) but we had to queue for tickets and then again for the lift to the top sphere. Unfortunately it was a hot day and there was no air",
          "I wouldn't recommend that people visit this \"attraction\". Although the view from the top was nice, we spent more time queueing to get up there than we actually spent at the top. There is a museum inside the atomium which could interest some people but it wasn't for me.",
          "Visited the Atomium on a Sunday afternoon we had pre booked our tickets on line before travelling. The queue for the lift is d as it snakes back and forth making it hard to anticipate how long the wait will be. After 45 minutes we entered the lift for the very quick ascent to",
          "Better than expected! The structure itself is novel, and you get to travel from sphere to sphere using stairs and escalators that move through the tubes linking the spheres. They also had some fun exhibits of propoganda and advertising from the 50\u2019s, and several rooms of really",
          "We went to mini europe first then did the Atomium. Very nice to walk around and visit (a few escalators to help get to each ball). Each ball had something different, one had different lights going off to the music, the kids (8 and 11 yo) loved it. There's a lift to go to the top",
          "We didn't actually go inside but it's nice to look at and take pictures and very close to mini Europe super cute attraction. Follow me at flywithfara to see pictures and video from both locations.",
          "More than 100 metres of technology for this Fe-cluster in a gigantic scale! The location is perfect to be photographed from any positions, I think it's one of the best attractions in Bruxelles",
          "The Atomium is one of those architectural structures that challenges the common place. Built for the 1958 World Expo, in the middle of the Space Race, it has lots of references to that age of human history, but what makes it really stand out is the unique structure",
          "Late opening on 5 Friday nights in the summer. Atomium costs \u20ac15 not sure is really worth the money. Take the lift to the top to look at views which you can see for miles. Can look down at mini Europe from a height. After coming down the lift you can go up the escalator to",
          "We took the train, got our picture and went back. Perhaps if we had more time to look around, that would have been more fun. But, seriously, that was built in the 1950s when you've got so much history from centuries prior, I'm glad we didn't spend much time here.",
          "We took the train to the Atomium metro station nearby think it was called Heinzel or something like that? We did not go inside only in the shop but it was good to have a wander around it.. worth a visit just to see the size of it.",
          "The place was very beautiful and the park was huge a lot of family\u2019s can have a good time . I didn\u2019t put 5 star Because I found a little expensive the entrance",
          "Didn't go inside, but the grounds and gardens around are beautiful! Looks worth it to go inside, we didn't have enough time.",
          "Atomium is one of the most spectacular sights in brussels but it is a little far from the main city .",
          "This is a pretty cool structure with panoramic views at the top. If you want to go to the top and see the two exhibits it's $15 euros. To go to the viewing deck you take an elevator but to see the exhibits there are 80 stairs.",
          "The Atomium is unlike any other place I've visited. It was so cool to be able to go inside and climb amongst the spheres. The exhibit on the history of the Atomium, including pictures and memorabilia from the 1958 World's Fair Expo, were also pretty interesting. What I disliked",
          "I have always imagined that this structure was smaller than it is for real however when I saw it close by, I could not believe ho huge it is. Atomium is definetly a must see icon . I greatly admire the minds who decided to build this up decades ago. Good job !. Thanks for all",
          "We enjoyed this Attraction \u2014 but there should be a warning about number of steps and unexpected flashing lights. In our party of 7 there was someone not expecting as many steps as there were (escalating up, stairs down) and flashing / moving lights in tunnels and rooms.",
          "Must visit attraction in Brussels. The architecture of this structure has no comparison to anything else in the world. The view of the structure from outside is legendary. The expo inside is also great. Shows the history of the structure and how it was engineered. The light and",
          "Yes this is an icon of Brussels. We went on the on off bus to see this as it's out a bit. It's worth doing though.",
          "I wouldn't say it is the best place to visit in Brussels but if you have more days to stay there, then you should visit it. It is nice. Modern architecture",
          "We went on a Friday and there was this summer festival going on for four weeks on each Friday. It was lively with music and dance. Also, the view is great from the top and bottom. For the top view, the ticket is a bit pricey at 15 EUR. But it is fun even at the bottom if there",
          "cool time travel & architecture, great to imagine the expo 1958 in brussels and experience the site today!",
          "Great views of Brussels. Best to get there for when it opens as we went straight in but saw big queues by the time we came out. Nice day out and mini Europe next door.",
          "The location is 5km from the city center. To get there with the public transport it's possible. With your own car you can find a parking place but not that easy. Specially on the weekend. To buy the ticket is a long queue and it cost 15\u20ac it's expensive so it's better to see it",
          "Looks good from outside. Nothing spectacular from inside. The surroundings could do with some fixing. Dusty and rough street.",
          "This place is huge. There is lots to see and do both inside the spheres and in the general park that it's in. It is one of the stops on the Big Bus tour of Brussels, so convenient to hop off and back on again.",
          "We have been here with the family. Everything was good but two challenging things. The area is generally not suitable for toddler strollers. And the second thing is that we queued for long and I didn't find it worth it.",
          "Great place for pictures. Parking is average. Would be nice if they maintained the grounds in front of the stomping. Maybe remove the grass/ sand and replace it with concrete!",
          "We visited here on a pleasant sunny day the surrounding area is nice and chilled with refreshments and snacks available at reasonable prices. The queue to get a ticket was not bad at all. We had an advanced ticket and entered pretty much straight away. The queue for the lift to",
          "We took the train from Brussels which was easy enough to the Atomium and were in awe of the magnificent structure that was built over 60 years ago. If you visit then it\u2019s best to pre book tickets online as the queue was long, thankfully I did that and it was only 15\u20ac. Not sure",
          "The actual building is a must to visit when in Brussels, however the contents of inside is not the most interesting and seems like it is an attempt to 'fill the space'. The best part would be the panoramic view, but for a better view of Brussels from slightly closer and cheaper",
          "This structure is just ok, and is a tourist trap. Parking was difficult, and it was packed, so we decided to not wait in line to go to the top.",
          "We took the trip to Heisel station to see the Atomium. Buying tickets online, we skipped the long queue for tickets and started out tour. It\u2019s amazing being inside this structure and the displays were fascinating. Worth the trip",
          "Nice to see from outside if you do not buy the tickets in advance; there is a bar just below where you can just lie down and sip your drink loking at the balls above you",
          "Nice views, good photo opportunities, good place to visit, but gets bit boring if you are not really fond of muesums.. especially with the long lines. Liked the music - light show, and the views form the top.",
          "Easy to reach from the City centre via the metro. Short walk from the Heysel Station. There are a number of other attractions around the atomium, so it is possible to spend a decent amount of time there. It does get busy, but if you want to venture inside the atomium, the ticket",
          "Great scientific structure. Good flow of information. Great view from the top. What fascinated me was the idea of being inside an atom. And the best thing was the simulation of a dying atom. The place was crowded with eager tourists and locals. The place was hot. And that is",
          "Cool place to go and see. The structure is pretty cool to see and when you go inside it\u2019s good. You go round the information and it\u2019s okay. The light show is really cool to see. Then the viewpoint is great. There is a long queue for the viewpoint as only one lift from the back",
          "The monument is grand indeed, very impressive and a sort of place that you must visit once in your life (if you can). We were not lucky and it wasn\u2019t a sunny day, so the views wasn\u2019t great as I would expect to be. A small restaurant on top of it (ridiculous expensive!!!!). On",
          "A (very simplified) version of a carbon atom. Info at each level along with Belgium's comic character Spirou, guiding you through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the optimistic vision of technology in the service of humans in the World Exposition of 1958. Beyond",
          "This is well worth a look but in my opinion it doesn't have the charm of other World's Fair exhibits (hard not to compare it to the Eiffel Tower! The view from the top is great (although we did have to queue for 40 minutes for the lift, it's not a bad queue - plenty of space,",
          "Visited here as me and my husband. The light exhibit was very interesting. If you want to go to the top to have the full 360 view, then be prepared to wait for at least 30 minutes to get onto the lift to go up.",
          "A Belgian spoke so disparagingly about this structure, that we wondered whether we should really bother to visit it. But when we realised that the Hop On Hop Off bus stops right there, we decided to see it. It's huge and it's impressive, and if for nothing else it's worthwhile",
          "Full travel review vid avail - link in my bio. The Atomium is by far one of the weirdest tourist attractions you can go to, and if you're in Brussels it's worth the trek out to. A bit of a hike from the city center, this giant atom you can walk in offers some fantastic views of",
          "We went to the top floor and got some beautiful views of the city. The other spheres have different museums of the history of the atonium and not much more.",
          "To be honest, we weren't really ecstatic to visit the Atomium but when we arrived, we actually didn't realise we would have such an amazing time here! I highly recommend this place if you are able to visit. There are a lot of stairs and escalators which are quite steep with gaps",
          "The building was avant garde technology for 1958 and still remains to this day an interesting sight. However, the 15 eur ticket was way too expensive for what it has to offer (I mean Louvre ticket cost 16 and you cannot compare them by far), we walked at fast pace through the",
          "We chose the go up the escalator instead of the elevator. We were not able to go to the very top. That was fine because the line for the elevator was just too long.",
          "If staying in Brussels for more than day, worth a visit. Would recommend arriving at opening to avoid wait for tickets and access. It is a cool experience going through the structure and it offers a great view of the city. Be prepared for a lot of stairs only parts are",
          "Am amazing structure that defies description- amazingly still futuristic even though 50+ years old. It can be seen for miles too However it is quite hard to find if you are unused to the city and on a bike....few signposts anywhere- which is surprising? Well worth a trip",
          "Very boring place and super overrated . Nothing to do inside and they charge for everything. Definitely a disappointment",
          "Great place to visit. Especially on a nice hot clear day. Beware of large queues though! Reasonably prices to enter. Recommend buying the mini europe ticket as well!",
          "Interesting stop, nothing earth shattering. Exhibit seems pretty outdated. Lots of items from the 1958 Worlds Fair.",
          "Of all the times we have been to Brussels, this is the first time we have been here. Although it's on the outskirts it's an easy ride on the metro then a short walk, it was well worth the effort and you won't be disappointed. We used our Brussels card, so got a discount on",
          "Did not have the time to climb it or enter inside, but still the stop was well worth it. Kids loved it!",
          "This giant work of art is an impressive part of the Brussels sky line. We did not pay to go in- but just being there was worth it. It is a stop on the hop on/hop off CitySightseeing bus tours. The Basillica, which is the next stop on the hop on/hop off bus tour, also has a",
          "Atomium is great structural beauty and is a superb photostop. The lush green grass in front makes it more attractive.",
          "We were leaving Brussels for Bruges and on our way out of the city we made a stop at the Atomium. We did not have the time to go inside this attraction but had done so on a previous visit to this attraction. I definitely recommend a visit.",
          "I found the structure very impressive and the view one of the best in Brussels. The visit is well organized. You first receive information on the construction and then you move on to see it. There is a beautiful laser show on top. You can see the whole city with 360 degree view",
          "The Atomium is a really interesting and fascinating place. it does have lots of stairs; however the staff were so helpful, stopping the lift at different floors so I could see everything (as I had a walking stick). It is 60 years old and yet, it is still of interest today. The",
          "This is hard going one lift takes you up to top observation pod long wait then a long wait to come down.Then you go up by escalator to the other pods and we were told only stairs to come back down so gave it a miss after the first part\u2019s long wait",
          "What a fabulous landmark and feat of structural engineering.. Unfortunately, I did not complete the internal tour of the structure as I have recently recovered from a detached retina and unknown to me the second level is a manic led light show which caused me a major issue.",
          "Good to see from outside as well. Didnt go up. Is in vicinity of Mini Europe which is good for kids and grown ups.",
          "Went here by metro from central Brussels - really easy and cheap. Short walk from the station and great photo opportunity along the way. Had to queue for a while to get up the lift but no worries - lots to read and watch. Helpful lift staff took you right up to the top where",
          "I arrived just in time before the last entry. The visit was great; I especially loved the sound and light show which was very sci-fi, electronic and captivating. The escalators between floors were very \"space age\". The guide in the lift was lovely and friendly.",
          "I went on the hop on hop off bus and passed this place but again I didn\u2019t have time to get off the bus to have a look inside but I\u2019ll definitely be back and have a look around. You also get a discount with the bus ticket.",
          "Came here with my 14 year old and we had fun climbing up and down the stairs, reading about the exposition, and tripping out on the light art piece. Our ticket included the design museum which we also enjoyed especially all the puffy plastic furniture.",
          "The Atomium is a must see if you are visiting Brussels and I did enjoy it but felt I bit let down. There is a lot of escalators and stairs (to get to the various sections) and then minimal action when you get there. It was interesting but could be a lot better! The museum is",
          "hard to reach by car because of road works.... but at last we saw it closely. quite impressive. the visit is interesting (light play, history of the building etc) and nice view from the top",
          "We loved the Atomium! Kids had a blast moving all through it. Never seen anything like it. Definitely a highlight of our weekend visit to Brussels.",
          "Interesting architecture, a glimpse into the thinking of the 1950s - good exhibit in the renovated Atomium, about its creation. The light show in the escalator tunnels is a bit fantasy, but so be it. Entrance tickets are 15 Euro per person, I would not like to pay more...(at",
          "The exhibitions are always interesting and taking the elevator to the top is always a fun experience (kids love it cause they can feel it in their stomachs AND the top of the elevator is made of glass). Having a drink at the top while looking out at the park and Brussels in the",
          "The train ride is worth it just to witness this building. I've never seen anything like it. We didnt go up but we took some cool pictures from outside. Mini Europe is right next door which we saw next.",
          "Highly impressive building that amazed me more than I thought it would. If you don't plan to go up I recommend an evening visit when the building is beautifully lit up",
          "As we were free on Sunday morning, went atomium to see the structure. The line was not long at 10 am . Nothing much as we use the escalator to go 6 level. Just another structure and see from Outside is more then enough .",
          "Worth the money! Buy your ticket online to skip the line. The 365 view was disappointing because it was very crowded and it was hard to see out the windows. However, the light show inside was beautiful and awe-inspiring. Such a unique experience. Gift shop is nice. Bring cash",
          "We went to the atomium with zero expectations. Literally zero. But it\u2019s really impressive to the eye, as impressive as it made us get tickets to go inside they took us pictures with a mascot and stuff and first mistake comes here... I love 360 Views I really do! But this one",
          "It was just a photo stop at this place on our way to Belgium which was a very long journey of 9 hours we probably spent about 15 minutes here to take some photos.",
          "It is cool, didnt go inside, but is worth a look. The area is also very nice. If short on time it is not a must.",
          "Went in to see Atonium and Mini Europe as they are next to each other but frankly was disappointed by the hype. Nothing much to see in both the places and you are better off spending that time in citi center.",
          "-This place is kind of out of center so takes maybe half an hour to get to - too many people, visitors, skateboarders - beautiful pictures opportunity, really looks great on the outside -for me it was boring inside, or let me rephrase this \u2013 not sure if it was worth 15\u20ac for me,",
          "Very interesting history and path paved forward. True to the characteristics of Brussels it has an international focus, this specifically on human rights and equality. In addition, there are some surprises inside the tour, that are very different than what you might expect,",
          "This must be one of the coolest things I've seen. Me and my boyfriend took the subway to see atomium. It is huge and one could walk into 5 of the balls with a lift to the top where there are sick nice views and with a rather expensive and fancy resturant, also from the middle",
          "We have rated \u2018very good\u2019 because this is an iconic structure which shouldn\u2019t be missed, but in all honesty we thought more could be done within the spheres to make them more engaging to the 21st century visitor. I\u2019d suggest booking your ticket in advance to avoid the queue and",
          "I have to say this place was brilliant, you need to be fit as there is a lot of stairs, but as you go from orb to orb everything changed. If there is a downside the restaurant is hugely expensive and food is not great. One thing I don\u2019t understand, is that you get the lift all",
          "My friend said it was Brussels version of the Eiffel tower. I cannot confirm or deny this assertion. Accessible via tram and metro, I found it as a nice thing to do in Brussels. Close by is the Mini-Europe, and between the two attractions and lunch, one can easily spend the",
          "Went for a short visit just to get some pictures of this amazing site, and we were not disappointed!! Worth a trip- you don't need a lot of time!",
          "We did not Get tickets to go inside, but just the view of Atomium was good enough. Very beautiful and awesome. Would reccomend to go here and check it out, but its a good 20 min from brussels city by car.",
          "I came here in December 2018 for New Year as this was where the main Brussels party was. You can get here from the city centre on the metro line. Didn't get to go inside, but the New Year party was pretty cool outside. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the city.",
          "We went to the Atomium as something to do with our kids ages 13 to 15 and it was just ok. I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to go here and it\u2019s something you can miss if you are short of time. The exhibits weren\u2019t very exciting and the views not too impressive. Cool to look at from",
          "The structure is still impressive after 60 years and the visit inside is well structured. Great panoramic views from up top and lots of background about the construction and so on. A real time travel experience of what the future and modernity looked like in 1958!",
          "This is a must-see experience whenever you visit Brussel! Strange, scientific and slightly alienating from the outside. From the inside, beautiful view over Brussel. Great art exhibitions on the inside. I never thought crystalline iron magnified 165 billion times would be as",
          "The Atomium is a must see while visiting Brussels. It is a really neat attraction dating back 50+ years. It is located in a nice park area and is relatively easy to get to. It is really quite picturesque and while I found it to be a bit smaller than what I had envisioned from",
          "9 aluminum bowls, because of 9 province in Belgium. 1958 when its build. Now a days Brussels keep it for tourists to visit.",
          "This was one of the last things I visited while I stayed in Belgium as it was across the city from where I was staying. It is relatively easy to get to as there is the metro or tram that gets you to the area. However, once I arrived I realized there was not much around (aside",
          "I and my son really liked the place. It gave a possibility to look over the city, learn about the history of the building and enjoy cool lights and music.",
          "Pretty great sculpture, impressive once you\u2019re inside as to how many floors you go up (lift and escalator mainly!) great views once you\u2019re inside also. Oh and buy a waffle from the van outside... amazing!!",
          "Known about the Atomium since I was 10 and 40 years s later I visited... what a great experience, just to be there and to go up to the top... a must if you\u2019re in Brussels..",
          "Nice area, good car park next to it. Pay by machine, dont bother to book advance, plenty of places. Dont spend money to go to the top, nothing exciting apart from a bar with limited food option if you are vegan",
          "Great value for money, I booked online so 1 were made, we arrived early and the queues were minimal. A lift takes you to the top of the structure where you can take in the stunning views of the suburbs. Once you have finished on the viewing platform you take the lift down then",
          "If this is not your thing you can easily skip it but if you like architecture definitely stop by and look up. Also a nice structure to spot in the Brussels' skyline when you are on a roof somewhere with a view (and if you're lucky with a clear sky).",
          "The highest ball of the Atomium is the place where you can get the best view of the city. You arrive there with the elevator at the entrance of the Atomium. Inside you are walking with escalators.",
          "One of the main places of Brussels. Good to make some photos. It has the form of an atom and inside you can see a museum",
          "Interesting structure built for the 1958 exposition in Brussels. The spheres with connecting spokes are built from aluminium sheets, and it resembles an atom but magnified billions of times. It has been renovated twice since opening and celebrated the 60th year last year. Iconic",
          "It was very interesting and exciting to walk inside the atomium, but for the price of 15 Euros each it was not that much worth it, bu I still believe it is something you should see.",
          "I really loved the structure and its proportionate construction. We did not have sufficient time to enter and hence stopped for taking photos.",
          "Andr\u00e9 Waterkeyn is the Belgian Gustave Eiffel: he created the Atomium. That's a stupendous work, a real masterpiece! It is supposed to be an atom of iron, some 165 billion times bigger! As many have said here, it isn't necessary to go inside, unless you want to eat at the",
          "This is such a stunning piece of art work. Loved walking all aound it taking pictures of the different angles of the structure. Make sure you find the panoramic selfie machine.",
          "Impressive building. You get student discount from tickets and Inside were lots of info and cool light show.",
          "Not worth the money to wait 30 minutes to take an elevator 3 stops to spend 10 minutes to see the city.",
          "I love the story around the atomium and what a good thing that it was rebuilt in 2006 so we can all enjoy it today. It\u2019s only \u20ac8 each for a student which is very reasonable. The views from the top are beautiful and although the exhibitions are only small they are very",
          "Really, if you are visiting Brussels, it is well worth the uber ride to visit and just experience this monument and interactive experience. Recommend making reservations at the restaurant to take in the full experience.",
          "While.staying in Brussels we decided to visit the atomium not knowing to what expect we just thought it was something to do however we was so glad we decided to go from start to finish we was entertained going up into the different parts was great fun and the bar at the top was",
          "A bit further out of town than I had imagined but we were using the hop on hop on bus so the journey provided us with a wonderful overall view of Brussels that we usually would not of had the opportunity to see. The Atomium is huge, so much larger than we had thought and well",
          "Even if you think that you have seen it from the pictures, do go. It\u2019s impressive, it\u2019s tall and if you go during the later afternoon it glitters beautifully in the sun. Take the metro or tram 3. Didn\u2019t go up, instead went to the nearby park and chateau of Laeken.",
          "A bit away from the city center but worth the excursion for a lunch or dinner reservation. Our meal was exceptional, and the tour of the other pods, particularly the light show was definitely worth the time. Leave enough time to stroll through the park. Wish I was a kid in",
          "Sure, it's basically 7 spheres and some steel tubes connecting them. But it's also huge, impressive and a one-of-a-kind in the world. Located just outside the city, but easily reached by metro train and next to two other sights (Mini Europe and the nearly a century old event",
          "I never had heard of or seen this before so I was excited to visit something different. The exhibits inside were fine and we spent about an hour inside. The view from top was nice. The elevator line moved quickly. It was nice to get some exercise with the stairs.",
          "Impressive landmark, 50 years old, close to the metro line, in a 5 minute walk ranve. Perfect place to take some pictures. The line to enter was pretty long, so consider to go there with time.",
          "I was underwhelmed. I had no expectations because I'd never heard of it. This is a beautiful structure from the World's Fair. It really is impressive. The information presented seems to be trying too hard and is stretched a little thin. If it were just the history of the man,",
          "With an interesting history and some good information this is a good place to have a look around. You get a good view from the top",
          "This was the second time I have visited the Atomium and despite the weather I still had a brilliant experience. The information throughout was very interesting and we enjoyed the lighting effects on the escalators.",
          "It\u2019s something special when you go to this Atomium! It was a good experience and they have a nice park close by!",
          "Really enjoyed, interesting bit of history about it but the light show is just fantastic. Amazing views, definitely time well spent!",
          "Myself and my friend came to visit and we were amazed by the light show inside, the views were spectacular overall a great day out here.",
          "This is the second time we have visited the first was with our 4 year old grandaughter who thought it was great especially the light shows - she did get rather fed up with all the queing (40 mins to get the lift down from the top viewing platform).Views from the top are good and",
          "Spect to be here for 2 plus hours with a pre-purchased ticket and expect plenty of steps Attractions in the spheres are very good Great view of Brussels from the viewing sphere and nice restaurant at the top, again with good views",
          "Cool exhibition and a great view but there are a lot of stairs and would be good if the restaurant could be like a roof top bar. It was only open for bookings when we were there.",
          "Despite mixed reviews we decided to visit The Atomium and are so pleased that we did! Thoroughly enjoyed our few hours here. Hardly any queue when we arrived in the morning. Bought the combined ticket which included Mini Europe and The Adam Exhibition (did not visit) for",
          "Definitely worth it and we will go again. Great views of the Brussels. Very neat history. Cool artistic light show and your ticket gets you into other local attractions within walking distance.",
          "This was very interesting but it is a very long queue to the lift to the top ball. There were a number of very upset children around us by the time we got to the elevator. The view is not that great from the top ball anyway, I think the other spheres were far more interesting",
          "During my recent Europe trip, i got the opportunity to visit this site. It's an beautiful irony architectural structure built for World Expo 1958.After few years of the Exfo,the Belgium govt decided to demolish that huge structure. But till then its become an high tourist",
          "The most famos landmark of Brussels, the Atomium, needs to be visited. It is an impressive structure. You can visit it from the inside. There are always exhibitions inside. Transportation is by elevator, escalator and stairs. The view from the top is excellent, especially on a",
          "This structure is awesome, in the true sense of the word. It was awesome to see! The queues were far too long for us to go inside but it was such a beautiful, sunny day that we were happy to stay outside, grab a coffee and marvel at the breathtaking architecture. There's also a",
          "Good views from the top but be prepared to wait. Lots of things to read about on the various levels.",
          "Stand in line ( that\u2019s if you have a ticket ) for 35-60 mins . Go up the elevator just to look through dirty windows. Then stand in line to go down again . Waste of time and money . Save yourself money and look at it from outside, much more beautiful.",
          "This place is definitely worth visiting as its architecture itself is great.The whole building is very unique and you can see for miles from the small windows inside. There is a large queue though so watch out for that.",
          "Was an interesting experience to understand purpose of the Atomium. Travelling inside is a unique experience.",
          "It was built at the time when there was not modern technology and machine to build such as big model of atoms. I must say everyone should visit this with their kids to experience it.",
          "This place is worth a visit. The queues were really long so we didn't get a chance to go in. We stayed in the area and took many photos. A lovely park close by as well. Plenty of space to relax and spend the day.",
          "I had high hopes from this landmark restaurant but when I went there today, I had a terrible experience. In order to celebrate my birthday, my wife suggested that we book a seat for us when we decided to travel to Brussels as part of my birthday celebrations. We made a booking",
          "A super long queue for a single lift, most of the escalators are not working. Nothing to be seen but darkness. Maybe worth it from the outside to have a look before visiting Mini Europe.",
          "The staff working here was very nice and offered good assistance. Signage can be better in the entrance. It\u2019s not quite clear where to go and whats the difference between the elevator (panorama view) and escalators. Maybe I missed it, but it made for a confusing visit.",
          "A must to visit in Bruxelles. The construction is amazing. If you want to enter you should book online well in advance.",
          "The Atomium square is a perfect point for great visuals and amazing photography. Walking distance is Mini Europe with mini-sized installations of ionic structures and locations. Must Visit sightseeing point if you visiting Brussels",
          "A very unique experience\u2014wish we had more time at this museum! Everyone especially liked the music/lights show (picture posted). And definitely get the Belgium waffle from the food truck parked right by\u2014delicious!",
          "We visited the Atomium......did not go up it. My husband did as a child (73 now) and still remembers it fondly! It was quite a site in 1958!",
          "This destination proved to be far and worthless. The weather was too hot, especially in the elevator. This wss a worthless trip.",
          "A 20-30 euro ride from the centre. Extraordinary architecture and a cool hang out. You can't get enough of the beautiful tulips!",
          "This place is nicely placed, has a lot of things to read and learn about. (It has one issue, there are parts where you have to climb, no elevator, or escalator of 87 stairs, even to the Restaurant).",
          "Must see in belgium, u can get as a plus sometimes to the other musums nearby. There is many things to discover inside, also good for the kids within family visits.",
          "I enjoyed my visit to the Atomium, it\u2019s not an expensive attractive and the interaction we have inside the \u201cglobes\u201d is really interesting.",
          "The Atomium is a strange, spectacular and magnificent landmark in Brussels. I liked taking the elevator inside the tubes. Nice exhibitions, stunning view over Brussels. Snacks for the nerds: If you look closely in the 0,5 euro binoculars at the top level, you will even see the",
          "It is really huge. I wasn t inside, but I recommend and the park near Atomium is also a place to visit.",
          "We visited the Atomium in the afternoon and first you can visit some parts of it before queing for the lift to the top. I recommend a visit but consider to skip the que for the top. It took us 35 minutes to wait and then after 5 minutes of beautiful view we had to que for 25",
          "What can I say about this attraction other than it looks great from the outside. Try to go in and you\u2019ll face long queues and the pleasures of other people\u2019s body odour for several hours to basically visit a viewing platform. Visit it, get a selfie from outside and get on with",
          "They tell you you should buy your ticket in advance. And then you queue outside, then inside... and there s no process to manage the excess of visitors. Don't go.",
          "A nice little stroll through the different sections. A lot of the exhibitions went over my head but great observation area.",
          "Due to the time frame we had to visit this after 9pm at night. Looked beautiful with lights on but unfortunately couldn't go in as it was closed. Just went closer to take a photo.",
          "Well worth the visit, and buy the dual pass so you can check out the mini Europe as well. The Atomium is full of information. I went around it pretty quickly as a solo tourist, but you can spend as long as you want taking in all the sights (when opportunity prevails)",
          "I have two young boys and for a short trip in Brussels I feel I should\u2019ve spent more time here than in Copenhagen! Brussels is a hidden gem and there\u2019s a lot to do around the area. This is neat because you go in an elevator all the way up and it\u2019s pretty cool. The views are",
          "What can one say about this amazing piece of engineering. You either will love it or hate it but really it is ingenious. Take your time so you can really take it in. A masterpiece and a must on your visit.",
          "The Grand place you can take a walk insides those ball's and see allot of history(Wetenskaplike) and learn from it.We traveled in June 2004",
          "I first visited the Atomium in 1984 while on a business trip with 2 colleagues, at which time I found it a little tired and jaded. I recently re-visited with my daughter and I have to say it has been revitalised. I definitely found it to be much improved, with the addition of",
          "It was great visiting an attraction that is based on science as well as it contribution to the city. It is a unique attraction. We bought the 3 attraction pass and spent most of the day at the 3 attractions. We arrived early and missed the queues to get to the viewing deck.(We",
          "Easy access with public transportation. It\u2019s located away from the city center but in a nice part of the city \ud83d\ude0a",
          "I thought that this structure, built for the world fair was very impressive. Might want to visit the restaurant at the top next time.",
          "The atomium looks really great from outside and offers very great panoramic views from the top. However, we thought that the exhibition itself was a bit underwhelming. It mostly focuses on the atomium itself so if you are not super interested in its history, then it is a bit",
          "Great place to visit, tickets for 2 attractions (including Mini Europe) are about 28e. And it takes all together about 3h - definitely worth to visit while in Brussels. To get there you can use Metro from the main station (abt 20min)",
          "It's a little far out of the centre but easily accessed by the metro. The Atomium was a giant model of an atom. The queues can be quite long but it's a good view at the top.",
          "Hard to believe when you arrive that a Worlds fair covered the land where a forest now grows around the Atomium. The theme building for the 1958 worlds fair is all that is left and is quite an impressive sight. You can go up into three of the \u201catoms\u201d with the top one having",
          "The Atomium by it self is impressive and a must-see when you are in Bruxelles. However, we just made a bad experience at the ticket-shop that we better mention to help you/others. We bought our ticket for 15\u20ac, and then afterwards I\u2019ve seen the flyer for \u201cMini-Europe\u201d and asked",
          "Massive sightseeing with interesting facts and light show inside. I would recomment to visit it to all Bsussels tourists.",
          "Such a great landmark, if you are in town it is a must place to get your selfie. Nice from every angle but queues can spoil your mood.",
          "When I visited Atonium, I didn't know about its special effects with lights and music inside it, when you visit it you will go through different levels with different special effects of light and sounds, in my opinion the craziest and most excited part was in the room where you",
          "I would suggest to bring your own drinks, everything at the Atomium is overpriced, including the admission. Other than that no other complaints. It's interesting to see it from inside, riding on escalators with psychedelic lighting, seing the exhibits on how it was",
          "Its pretty far out from the city but it was still nice to see. We didn't actually go inside since we didn't think it was worth the cost but seeing from the outside was good enough. We went to Mini-Europe and you can actually get some pretty nice shots of the Atomium from their.",
          "during our last stay there were too much visitors. several times before we had a lot of fun due to no long waiting time",
          "Loved our visit. Not much to see inside, but the views are great. Also has a restaurant at the top, we didn't use it but it looks very nice. The temporary exhibition didn't add much to the experience.",
          "It is quite far out from the city centre but easily accessible on a metro or tram. It is very impressive during the day or at night when it is lit up. I also did the tour of it inside but it wasn't worth it. Good place for photos an d an icon of Brussels.",
          "If you have some extra time to spare, then I would recommend it, but I wouldn't consider it a \"must\" attraction. The structure is different, but then we had to wait in line for a long time to go to the top. Besides the view, not a big deal I guess. This might be a time consuming",
          "My wife and I read that the atomium has an exception that compares today to 50 years ago Well, it appears that it only had one photo that was taken in the same place 50 years apart. Other than that, the exhibition is about the purpose of this place that was built 50 years ago",
          "It was worth the visit for the view but I found the rest of the attraction a bit lacking! Some of the other areas were just a bit odd! Was in and out in half an hour and most of that was in a queue to get into the lift. Mini Europe was close by and worth a visit!",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by the Atomium experience. Loved the view, the disco floor with music and lights and I love history from the 50s.",
          "It is a huge model of an atom where you can pay to travel / walk inside. It is unique. It is in a park with beautiful flowers nearby. There is a cafe next to it and all- important for-pay bathrooms.",
          "This is a structure built for the 1958. The design has stood the test of time as it will looks very contemporary. You can take an escalator up into the structure but the line can be long. There isn't much else to do once you've seen it, but it's worth the trip for the sight.",
          "The Atomium near Ossegempark in Brussels is a unique structure built in 1958 for the world trade fair. There's a lift which takes you to the top ball which consists of 2 levels, an observation level and right at the top a restaurant (can't comment), once you have visited this",
          "I walked here with my husband while exploring Brussels. It's a good hour walk from the center square of Brussels. It's a neat thing to see as it was built for a world fair in the 1950s. We didn't spend any money to go up. We just admired it from a distance.",
          "My daughter and I really enjoyed the Atomium. The people who work here couldn't be nicer and it was a fun experience, with great views at the top. It was quite hot, even though the weather outside was cool and I think crowded in August, it might be pretty brutal, but it was",
          "Really enjoyed the day, was pretty interesting to see everything the building had been and was used for originally. Really unique and worth a visit for that reason, but probably most impressive from the outside! The escalators inside were fun with psychedelic music and lights",
          "Interested photo opportunities from right underneath. Didn't bother to go up. Out of the way and a bit underwhelming.",
          "Easy access from the train and bigger in person then I imagined. The kids found it funky. We didn\u2019t make it inside as it was closed, but still enjoyed it.",
          "It is a symbol, an icon of Brussels, I know, but still I could have skipped my visit and still not miss something important from this city\u2019s highlights. It is far from the city center, always crowded, too many people waiting in the line. Just take a postcard from the center of",
          "One of the best sightseeing in Brussels. A nice retro statement of 1950's modernization & design making it one of the most important places to visit.",
          "The structure of the Atomium is actually phenomenal, like nothing else I have ever seen. It's truly remarkable. The views are amazing on a clear day, but probably not worth it if it's a hazy or overcast day. The exhibitions are really fascinating, showing the history of the",
          "Its iconic, makes you remember what got us all hooked into SiFi. Was Forbidden Planet before your time? Get inside and get into anoher deminsions. It showcases our first contact with outer space and science.",
          "Wonderful. You take your breath away so beautiful. Impossible to be indifferent to a magnificent monument building. Do not miss out on your next trip to Brussels.",
          "Really cool place and well worth the visit, only 20 or so minutes on the metro. Would not recommend paying for the ticket into it. Nothing to do in the place itself only queue for 45 minutes. Take all the photos of it that you want on the outside, and it's free!",
          "I worked in Brussels 20 years ago and 'never got round' to visiting whilst I was there. This time we visitied Brussels for a long weekend and it was on the list. Great views, very interesting place. Go early to avoid queues.",
          "I have been to Brussels many times and not had the time to come here. I would definitely recommend visiting, it is very impressive as a monument but also the exhibitions were very knowledgeable. The history of the worlds fare and the design and construction of the atomium are",
          "It's quite a nice museum. Fun was definitely had by all four of us. Great location for photos, even on a cloudy day.",
          "Atomium is a science museum and an modern architectural masterpiece . Must visit in brussels, even the journey to Atomium is very beautiful and give city insights",
          "I'll agree it is an incredible piece of architecture baring in mind it was built in the 50s. However, it is definitely a lot more impressive from the outside than in the inside. Plus, you don't pay to see it from the outside! Visiting the inside was not worth the 15 euro we paid",
          "I was a bit reluctant to go and visit this attraction as I didn't think that I would find it interesting however thought I should go since I was in Belgium and like to explore the top attractions. It was actually really fun! There is a camera there which takes a photo of you",
          "Located a bit outside city center (reachable by the tube) this place is amazing. You feel so small in a big world. The area is nice and green and you get a local feel. The monument is huge and no disappointment. And also some nice sculptures around. We did not go inside. it was",
          "Glad we took the time to see this sight. It was an interesting piece of the city\u2019s history. Wonderful exhibits throughout showing the drawings of the building and the construction.",
          "We only saw this site from a distance, but it was no less cool. Next time we'll have to get closer, but it was cool just seeing it if only from a far.",
          "I decided to take a (long) walk from the center of the city to the Atomium and unfortunately, I arrived a bit too late and therefore couldn\u2019t enter/go up but it\u2019s a very impressive construction that offers great views to the city. There\u2019s a restaurant at the top but I was told",
          "A really unusual attraction that is definitely worth a few hours for kids and adults alike, views from the top sphere and awesome",
          "Amazing place you must visit if in Brussels but be prepared to queue for the lift up to the top. I did not find this a major problem however what I did find utterly unbelievable was when the couple in front of me left the queue as they believed that getting the escalator up to",
          "Definitely for the facebook and snapchat photograhers. If in Brussels it is an interesting place to visit but once done is done. Design is very interesting and unique, with decent views up top. It has an automated 'selfie photo' down the front which emails you your photo. Like",
          "I would not recommend coming to the Atomium there are lots of better things to do in Brussels. It is expensive the view is not that nice and there are better viewpoints in Brussels the exhibition is not interesting in all I would recommend you come it is a waist of time.",
          "This is a nice exhibition and definitely a must if you're new to Brussels, however there is certainly no need to go twice- the queue was insanely long even though we didn't have to queue for tickets (which would have doubled our waiting time) and overall, although the view over",
          "The place was amazing but be prepared to stand in a queue (or was it because it was a nice Easter weekend!).",
          "We wanted to see the exposition but instead were forced to stay in a queue for more than half an hour to get to the top and see panorama view. We didn\u2019t even want to see that view as we came only for exposition. But when they delivered us to the top floor we were told to wait in",
          "We arrived by train at around 1130am, and despite apparently having a \u2018skip the line ticket\u2019, it turned out to be pointless, as we still had to wait in a massive line to enter the building. The queue for the loft to the top took us t0 minutes, and when we did get to the top it",
          "One of iconic design in Brussule and must see or visit The entrance 16\u20ac with nice discount if you mix both atomism plus mini Europe park At the end of your visit to Atomium there small museum having very old equipment We really enjoyed our time",

          "This monument is pretty cool. Looked from outside. Huge lines to get ticket and then another line to go up.",
          "An experience not to be missed, yes you have to queue, but its worth it. The views from the top are amazing. Tip: toilets are in the same building that you buy the tickets from.",
          "Visited here because it was a \u201cmust do\u201d thing in Brussels. It was miles out of the centre but eventually we arrived! There was a HUGE queue at the ticket desk, \u00a315 per person, when we eventually got a ticket we got hit with another massive line to actually get into the building,",
          "Admittedly, we did not go to the top of Atomium, and we can only imagine that the views from there would have been impressive. However, we couldn't justify the cost (and we were also quite exhausted from a considerably busy day). The structure itself is without doubt impressive,",
          "Overpriced Long queues Over rated Difficult to see the views Overall disappointing Only went to this as near to mini Europe",
          "I personally was very disappointed. First of all, it's far from the centre. When you finally get there, there are two queues: one to buy a ticket, the other to get inside the actual building. A terribly long wait. It's badly organised, so a lot of people didn't even realise that",
          "Worth a visit - but make sure to book a time slot in advance or you will spend your holiday queuing. We booked by a smartphone the day before and the tickets in the confirmation mail worked fine off the screen. We booked for 10 am - when they opened - and zoomed straight in. The",
          "The Atomium truly surpassed my expectations. From a distance the silver balls looked spectacular but inside was even better with music, unexpected light shows and stunning views of the city. We stopped off in one of the restaurants and they had seating around the edges for those",
          "must see atractions..visiting the atomnium was well worth a visit..great views accross the city is really an interesting",
          "Zzzzzzzz - long queues for the lift up and down. Not worth it. No imagination for any displays and overall good to look from the outside but don\u2019t bother going in",
          "It's about a 30-minute tram`Metro ride from the Gare Centrale - and really - just a cool quirky place to visit! Great view from the top - lots of stairs but worth a trip especially for kids!",
          "I mean, it's a giant atom you can climb into. I was personally unimpressed with the view from the top, but the exposition inside about the history of Atomium was very interesting, especially the light show.",
          "The Atomium is a great structure, but also check out the surrounding architecture, there's so much mid-century style, it's stunning!",
          "We visited Atomium on public holiday. It's a place that provides history of situations but the history in context is very recent (19th century). Not a great value addition. It was only place available for sightseeing on public holiday in Brussels. All shopping places were closed",
          "Really interesting experience. The light up balls were out favourites. If you have a fear of heights/escalators or steep stairs this is definitely not the place for you.",
          "It is the second time I have been in Brussels, at the first time I didn\u2019t have the chance to go inside the Atomium, but at the second time, I did it! It is interesting, it has a great view from the top, and it has a restaurant inside (I can\u2019t tell if the restaurant is good).",
          "Awesome Atomium built structure, very cool and innovative. Built in 1958 and stands at 335 ft tall. Reasonable cost and worth seeing.",
          "Our visit to the Atomium was admittedly a little rushed. We visited the exhibitions first, our favourite part was the light and music montages (though these are a little \u201ctrippy\u201d and come with a warning for epilepsy sufferers). The articles of the human rights and accompanying",
          "This Belgium Icon has undergone some restoration and repairs to keep it accessible and available to visitors that were much needed and are much appreciated. An amazing monument to mid 20th century dreams of an Atomic future, this unique structure is chock full of exhibit",
          "Much bigger than expected! The visit is well organised and extraordinary! Built for the world fair in 1958, it Must have been mind-boggling then. The view of the future and other exhibits from a 1958 perspective is really engaging. Had a great afternoon.",
          "If you are travelling from Armsterdam to Brussels by road, this is a bonus destination! Just 10 Km before reaching Brussels, a huge atomic structure made of steel. You can take a picture by the camera placed at the front of this structure, which will be emailed to you later",
          "the atomium itself is a very interesting building but the general location is worth a trip anyway. its a part of brussels which has little to do with the european capital!",

          "The Giant Atomium which is magnified billions times its normal size is spectacular. Knowing the structure history and efforts made to built it is astonishing!! The steep escalator with light effects and the view from top is amazing. Kids love to visit it along with the miniature",
          "We went to the atomium without knowing much about it or what was inside. The inside was amazing and not what we were expecting. Great LED lights. The staff spoke multiple languages. Impressive lifts and escalators. One downside is it is not completely accessible due to stairs.",
          "Climb all around the Atomium after a long wait for the elevator to the viewing sphere. The satellite spheres are infinitely interesting and fun. Although we try to steer our son clear of gift shops, this one is actually good and reasonably priced. If you have limited time in",
          "Away from the city center and really not worthy of the time and money! We waited for hours to get on the elevator which took ten to thirteen persons each time. The queue was enormous and the heat was exhausting! You get to the top and realize that this is NOT like the Eiffel",
          "If you go here its worth while to also go to mini Europe, lovely views of the area from the top. On the top level there is a nice cafe",
          "Cool place and gardens to spend an hour or so. You can pay for the atomium entrance, and also eat in the restaurant, but if not you can just have a stroll around and there are spots to leave the car for a couple of minutes.",
          "The Atomium is a major feat of engineering and architecture. The structure itself is HUGE and you can't appreciate it until you see it. To appreciate this building you have to stand outside and gaze up and its sheer enormity and marvel over how can this structure be possible. I",
          "Without any sort of doubt, if you pass nearby, I strongly recommend a visit. It is an imponent and magnificient structure, created for the EXPO several decades ago, and it is in mint condition, very well preserved. The staff is very nice, and you should do your visit with the"

        "wiki": "Antwerp ( (listen); Dutch: Antwerpen [\u02c8\u0251nt\u028b\u025brp\u0259(n)] (listen); French: Anvers [\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281s] (listen)) is a city in Belgium and the capital of Antwerp province in the Flemish Region. With a population of 520,504, it is the most populous city proper in Belgium, and with a metropolitan population of around 1,200,000 people, it is the second largest metropolitan region after Brussels.Antwerp is on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe and within the top 20 globally. The city is also known for its diamond industry and trade.\nBoth economically and culturally, Antwerp is and has long been an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (1576) and throughout and after the subsequent Dutch Revolt. Antwerp was also the place of the world's oldest stock exchange building, originally built in 1531 and re-built in 1872.The inhabitants of Antwerp are nicknamed Sinjoren (Dutch pronunciation: [s\u026a\u0272\u02c8jo\u02d0r\u0259(n)]), after the Spanish honorific se\u00f1or or French seigneur, \"lord\", referring to the Spanish noblemen who ruled the city in the 17th century. The city hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of the name ===\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include Ando Verpia on Roman coins found in the city centre, Germanic Andhunerbo from around the time Austrasia became a separate kingdom (that is, about 567 CE), and (possibly originally Celtic) Andoverpis in Dado's Life of St. Eligius (Vita Eligii) from about 700 CE. The form Antverpia is New Latin.A Germanic (Frankish or Frisian) origin could contain prefix anda (\u201cagainst\u201d) and a noun derived from the verb werpen (\u201cto throw\u201d) and denote, for example: land thrown up at the riverbank; an alluvial deposit; a mound (like a terp) thrown up (as a defence) against (something or someone); or a wharf. If Andoverpis is Celtic in origin, it could mean \"those who live on both banks\".There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river. He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. This is unlikely to be the true origin, but it is celebrated by a statue (illustrated further below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt.\n\n\n=== Pre-1500 ===\nHistorical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. Excavations carried out in the oldest section near the Scheldt, 1952\u20131961 (ref. Princeton), produced pottery shards and fragments of glass from mid-2nd century to the end of the 3rd century. The earliest mention of Antwerp dates from the 4th century.\nIn the 4th century, Antwerp was first named, having been settled by the Germanic Franks.The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980, by the German emperor Otto II, a border province facing the County of Flanders.\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon,  was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten established a community of his Premonstratensian canons at St. Michael's Abbey at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.\n\n\n=== 16th century ===\n\nAfter the silting-up of the Zwin and the consequent decline of Bruges, the city of Antwerp, then part of the Duchy of Brabant, grew in importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading houses were transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned to the association of English merchants active in the city is specifically mentioned in 1510. Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, importing the raw commodity from Portuguese and Spanish plantations on both sides of the Atlantic, where it was grown by a mixture of free and forced labour, increasingly enslaved Africans as the century progressed. The city attracted Italian and German sugar refiners by 1550, and shipped their refined product to Germany, especially Cologne. Moneylenders and financiers developed a large business lending money all over Europe including the English government in 1544\u20131574. London bankers were too small to operate on that scale, and Antwerp had a highly efficient bourse that itself attracted rich bankers from around Europe. After the 1570s, the city's banking business declined: England ended its borrowing in Antwerp in 1574.Fernand Braudel states that Antwerp became \"the centre of the entire international economy, something Bruges had never been even at its height.\" Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. Antwerp's golden age is tightly linked to the \"Age of Exploration\". During the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps.  Many foreign merchants were resident in the city. Francesco Guicciardini, the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with pepper and cinnamon would unload their cargo. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Spanish colonization of the Americas\".\n\nWithout a long-distance merchant fleet, and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very cosmopolitan, with merchants and traders from Venetian Republic, Republic of Ragusa, Spain and Portugal.  Antwerp had a policy of toleration, which attracted a large crypto-Jewish community composed of migrants from Spain and Portugal.By 1504, the Portuguese had established Antwerp as one of their main shipping bases, bringing in spices from Asia and trading them for textiles and metal goods. The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers. The city was a cosmopolitan center; its bourse opened in 1531, \"To the merchants of all nations.\" Antwerp experienced three booms during its golden age: the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by American silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the stabilising Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559, based on the textiles industry. At the beginning of the 16th century Antwerp accounted for 40% of world trade. The boom-and-bust cycles and inflationary cost-of-living squeezed less-skilled workers.  In the century after 1541, the city's economy and population declined dramatically The Portuguese merchants left in 1549, and there was much less trade in English cloth.  Numerous financial bankruptcies  began around 1557. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the major trading center for the region.\n\n\n=== Reformation era ===\nThe religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in violent riots in August 1566, as in other parts of the Low Countries. The regent Margaret, Duchess of Parma, was swept aside when Philip II sent the Duke of Alba at the head of an army the following summer. When the Eighty Years' War broke out in 1568, commercial trading between Antwerp and the Spanish port of Bilbao collapsed and became impossible. On 4 November 1576, Spanish soldiers sacked the city during the so-called Spanish Fury: 7,000 citizens were massacred, 800 houses were burnt down, and over \u00a32 million sterling of damage was done.\n\n\n=== Dutch revolt ===\nSubsequently, the city joined the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, captured it after a long siege and as part of the terms of surrender its Protestant citizens were given two years to settle their affairs before quitting the city. Most went to the United Provinces in the north, starting the Dutch Golden Age. Antwerp's banking was controlled for a generation by Genoa, and Amsterdam became the new trading centre.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nThe recognition of the independence of the United Provinces by the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648 stipulated that the Scheldt should be closed to navigation, which destroyed Antwerp's trading activities. This impediment remained in force until 1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed part of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp had reached the lowest point in its fortunes in 1800, and its population had sunk to under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its strategic importance, assigned funds to enlarge the harbour by constructing a new dock (still named the Bonaparte Dock) and an access- lock and mole and deepening the Scheldt to allow for larger ships to approach Antwerp. Napoleon hoped that by making Antwerp's harbour the finest in Europe he would be able to counter the Port of London and hamper British growth. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before he could see the plan through.\n\nIn 1830, the city was captured by the Belgian insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch garrison under General David Hendrik Chass\u00e9. For a time Chass\u00e9 subjected the town to periodic bombardment which inflicted much damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged by the French Northern Army commanded by Marechal Gerard. During this attack the town was further damaged. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chass\u00e9 made an honourable surrender, ending the Siege of Antwerp (1832).Later that century, a double ring of Brialmont Fortresses was constructed some 10 km (6 mi)  from the city centre, as Antwerp was considered vital for the survival of the young Belgian state. And in 1894 Antwerp presented itself to the world via a World's Fair attended by 3 million.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nAntwerp was the first city to host the World Gymnastics Championships, in 1903. During World War I, the city became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Li\u00e8ge. The Siege of Antwerp lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice.\nAntwerp hosted the 1920 Summer Olympics. \nDuring World War II, the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany in May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armoured Division on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the Port of Antwerp, which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of Rheinbote, V-1 and V-2 missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of Haredi (and particularly Hasidic) Orthodox Judaism.\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.Starting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre. Emphasizing the avant-garde, it tried to compete with London, Milan, New York and Paris. It emerged from organized tourism and mega-cultural events.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nThe municipality comprises the city of Antwerp proper and several towns. It is divided into nine entities (districts):\n\nAntwerp\nBerchem\nBerendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo\nBorgerhout\nDeurne\nEkeren\nHoboken\nMerksem\nWilrijkIn 1958, in preparation of the 10-year development plan for the Port of Antwerp, the municipalities of Berendrecht-Zandvliet-Lillo were integrated into the city territory and lost their administrative independence. During the 1983 merger of municipalities, conducted by the Belgian government as an administrative simplification, the municipalities of Berchem, Borgerhout, Deurne, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Wilrijk were merged into the city. At that time the city was also divided into the districts mentioned above. Simultaneously, districts received an appointed district council; later district councils became elected bodies.\n\n\n== Buildings and landmarks ==\n\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was noted for the wealth of its citizens (\"Antwerpia nummis\"). The houses of these wealthy merchants and manufacturers have been preserved throughout the city. However, fire has destroyed several old buildings, such as the house of the Hanseatic League on the northern quays, in 1891. During World War II, the city also suffered considerable damage from V-bombs, and in recent years, other noteworthy buildings have been demolished for new developments.\n\nAntwerp Zoo opened in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the world.\nAntwerp City Hall dates from 1565, and is built primarily in Renaissance style.\nAntwerp Central Station is a railway station designed by Louis Delacenserie which was completed in 1905.\nCathedral of Our Lady. This church was begun in the 14th century and finished in 1518. The church has four works by Rubens, viz. \"The Descent from the Cross\", \"The Elevation of the Cross\", \"The Resurrection of Christ\" and \"The Assumption\"\nSt. James' Church, is more ornate than the cathedral. It contains the remains of numerous famous nobles, among them a major part of the family of Rubens.\nThe Church of St. Paul has a baroque interior. It is a few hundred yards north of the Grote Markt\nSt. Andrew's Church\nSt. Charles Borromeo Church\nMuseum Vleeshuis (Butchers' Hall) is a fine Gothic brick-built building, situated a short distance to the North-West of the Grote Markt.\nPlantin-Moretus Museum preserves the house of the printer Christoffel Plantijn and his successor Jan Moretus\nThe Saint-Boniface Church is an Anglican church and headseat of the archdeanery North-West Europe.\nBoerentoren (Farmers' Tower) or KBC Tower, a 26-storey building built in 1932, is the oldest skyscraper in Europe. It is the tallest building in Antwerp and the second tallest structure after the Cathedral of our Lady. The building was designed by Emiel van Averbeke, R. Van Hoenacker and Jos Smolderen.\nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts\nMuseum Mayer van den Bergh, with works from the Gothic and Renaissance period in the Netherlands and Belgium, including paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nRubenshuis is the former home and studio of Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) in Antwerp. It is now a museum.\nRockox House is the former 17th-century Residence of Nicolaas II Rockox, lord Mayor of Antwerp.\nBourse of Antwerp. Originally built 1531; extensively restored 1872; now Antwerp Trade Fair.\nPalace of Justice, designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006. This building is the antithesis of the heavy, dark court building, designed by Joseph Poelaert, which dominates the skyline of Brussels. The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built on the site of the old Zuid (\"South\") station, at the end of a magnificent 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12). The building's highest 'sail' is 51 m (167 ft) high, has a floor area of 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft), and cost \u20ac130 million.\nZurenborg, a late-19th-century Belle \u00c9poque neighbourhood, on the border of Antwerp and Berchem, with many Art Nouveau architectural elements. The area counts as one of the most original Belle \u00c9poque urban expansion areas in Europe.\nMuseum aan de Stroom\nDen Botaniek or Antwerp's Botanical Garden, created in 1825. Located in the city centre, at the Leopoldstraat, it covers an area of almost 1 hectare.\nHarmonium Art museuM, a museum on pump organs in Klein-Willebroek\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (M HKA)\n\n\n== Fortifications ==\n\nAlthough Antwerp was formerly a fortified city, hardly anything remains of the former enceinte, only some remains of the city wall can be seen near the Vleeshuis museum at the corner of Bloedberg and Burchtgracht. A replica of a castle named Steen has been partly rebuilt near the Scheldt-quais in the 19th century.\nAntwerp's development as a fortified city is documented between the 10th and the 20th century. The fortifications were developed in different phases:\n\n10th century: fortification of the wharf with a wall and a ditch\n12th and 13th century: canals (so called \"vlieten\" and \"ruien\") were made\n16th century: Spanish fortifications\n19th century: double ring of Brialmont forts around the city, dismantling of the Spanish fortifications\n20th century: 1960 dismantling of the inner ring of forts, decommissioning of the outer ring of forts\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical population ===\n\nThis is the population of the city of Antwerp only, not of the larger current municipality of the same name.\n\n\n=== Minorities ===\nIn 2010, 36% to 39% of the inhabitants of Antwerp had a migrant background. A study projects that in 2020, 55% of the population will be of migrant background.\n\n\n==== Jewish community ====\n\nAfter The Holocaust and the murder of its many Jews, Antwerp became a major centre for Orthodox Jews. At present, about 15,000 Haredi Jews, many of them Hasidic, live in Antwerp. The city has three official Jewish Congregations: Shomrei Hadass, headed by Rabbi Dovid Moishe Lieberman, Machsike Hadass, headed by Rabbi Aron Schiff  (formerly by Chief Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) and the Portuguese Community Ben Moshe. Antwerp has an extensive network of synagogues, shops, schools and organizations. Significant Hasidic movements in Antwerp include Pshevorsk, based in Antwerp, as well as branches of Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Ger, Skver, Klausenburg, Vizhnitz and several others. Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth, chief rabbi of the Machsike Hadas community, who died in 2001, was arguably one of the better known personalities to have been based in Antwerp. An attempt to have a street named after him has received the support of the Town Hall and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\n==== Jain community ====\n\nThe Jains in Belgium are estimated to be around about 1,500 people. The majority live in Antwerp, mostly involved in the very lucrative diamond business. Belgian Indian Jains control two-thirds of the rough diamonds trade and supplied India with roughly 36% of their rough diamonds. A major temple, with a cultural centre, has been built in Antwerp (Wilrijk).  Mr Ramesh Mehta, a Jain, is a full-fledged member of the Belgian Council of Religious Leaders, put up on 17 December 2009.\n\n\n==== Armenian community ====\n\nThere are significant Armenian communities that reside in Antwerp, many of them are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. Most Armenian Belgians are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, with a smaller numbers are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church and Armenian Evangelical Church.\nOne of the important sectors that Armenian communities in Antwerp excel and involved in is the diamond trade business, that based primarily in the diamond district. Some of the famous Armenian families involved in the diamond business in the city are the Artinians, Arslanians, Aslanians, Barsamians and the Osganians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nAccording to the American Association of Port Authorities, the port of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port in the world in 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. It handled 235.2 million tons of cargo in 2018. Importantly it handles high volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm in the northern part of the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014\u20132020.  The old Belgian bluestone quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of 5.6 km (3.5 mi) to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.\n\n\n=== Diamonds ===\nAntwerp's other great mainstay is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds pass through the district annually, and in 2011 turnover in the industry was $56 billion. The city has four diamond bourses: the Diamond Club of Antwerp, the Beurs voor Diamanthandel, the Antwerpsche Diamantkring and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Antwerp's history in the diamond trade dates back to as early as the sixteenth century, with the first diamond cutters guild being introduced in 1584. The industry never disappeared from Antwerp, and even experienced a second boom in the early twentieth century. By the year 1924, Antwerp had over 13,000 diamond finishers. Since World War II families of the large Hasidic Jewish community have dominated Antwerp's diamond trading industry, although the last two decades have seen Indian and Maronite Christian from Lebanon and Armenian, traders become increasingly important.Antwerp World Diamond Centre, (AWDC) the successor to the Hoge Raad voor Diamant, plays an important role in setting standards, regulating professional ethics, training and promoting the interests of Antwerp as the capital of the diamond industry. However, in recent years Antwerp has seen a downturn in the diamond business, with the industry shifting to cheaper labor markets such as Dubai or India.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nA six-lane motorway bypass encircles much of the city centre and runs through the urban residential area of Antwerp. Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to Brussels, Hasselt and Li\u00e8ge, Ghent, Lille and Bruges and Breda and Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the Kennedy Tunnel (1967) and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel (1991).\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"Oosterweelconnection\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the Lange Wapper) over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum.In September 2010 the Flemish Government decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to Amsterdam and Paris, and national trains to Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Brussels, Charleroi, Hasselt, Li\u00e8ge, Leuven and Turnhout.\nAntwerp Central station is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in W G Sebald's haunting novel Austerlitz. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, 2 kilometres (1 mile) to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest classification yard for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by De Lijn and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The tram network has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"premetro\" and includes a tunnel under the river. The Franklin Rooseveltplaats functions as the city's main hub for local and regional bus lines.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nA small airport, Antwerp International Airport, is located in the district of Deurne, with passenger service to various European destinations. A bus service connects the airport to the city centre.\nThe now defunct VLM Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Antwerp International Airport. This office is also CityJet's Antwerp office. When VG Airlines (Delsey Airlines) existed, its head office was located in the district of Merksem.Belgium's major international airport, Brussels Airport, is about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the city of Antwerp, and connects the city worldwide. It is connected to the city centre by bus, and also by train. The new Diabolo rail connection provides a direct fast train connection between Antwerp and Brussels Airport as of the summer of 2012.\nThere is also a direct rail service between Antwerp (calling at Central and Berchem stations) and Charleroi South station, with a connecting buslink to Brussels South Charleroi Airport, which runs twice every hour on working days.\nThe runway has increased in length, and there is now direct connectivity to Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Greece from the city of Antwerp.\nIn September 2019 Air Antwerp began operations with their first route to London City Airport with old VLM Airlines Fokker 50's.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== City council ===\nThe current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections.\nThe current majority consists of N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld, led by mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA).\n\n\n=== Former mayors ===\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century important mayors include Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Nicolaas II Rockox.\nIn the early years after Belgian independence, Antwerp was governed by Catholic-Unionist mayors. Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Deti\u00e8ge and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (New Flemish Alliance).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntwerp has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) similar to that of Southern England, while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) average highs for both July and August. Winters are more dominated by the maritime currents instead, with temps being heavily moderated.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAntwerp had an artistic reputation in the 17th century, based on its school of painting, which included Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the Teniers and many others.\n\nInformally, most Antverpians (in Dutch Antwerpenaren, people from Antwerp) speak Antverpian daily (in Dutch Antwerps), a dialect that Dutch-speakers know as distinctive from other Brabantic dialects for its characteristic pronunciation of vowels: an 'aw' sound approximately like that in 'bore' is used for one of its long 'a'-sounds while other short 'a's are very sharp like the 'a' in 'hat'. The Echt Antwaarps Teater (\"Authentic Antverpian Theatre\") brings the dialect on stage.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nAntwerp is a rising fashion city, and has produced designers such as the Antwerp Six. The city has a cult status in the fashion world, due to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, one of the most important fashion academies in the world. It has served as the learning centre for many Belgian fashion designers. Since the 1980s, several graduates of the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts have become internationally successful fashion designers in Antwerp. The city has had a huge influence on other Belgian fashion designers such as Raf Simons, Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Theyskens and Kris Van Assche.\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nAntwerp is famous for its local products. In August every year the Bollekesfeest takes place. The Bollekesfeest is a showcase for such local products as Bolleke, an amber beer from the De Koninck Brewery. The Mokatine sweets made by Confiserie Roodthooft, Elixir D'Anvers, a locally made liquor, locally roasted coffee from Koffie Verheyen, sugar from Candico, Poolster pickled herring and Equinox horse meat, are other examples of local specialities. One of the most known products of the city are its biscuits, the Antwerpse Handjes, literally \"Antwerp Hands\". Usually made from a short pastry with almonds or milk chocolate, they symbolize the Antwerp trademark and folklore. The local products are represented by a non-profit organization, Streekproducten Provincie Antwerpen vzw.\n\n\n=== Missions to seafarers ===\nA number of Christian missions to seafarers are based in Antwerp, notably on the Itali\u00eblei. These include the Mission to Seafarers, British & International Sailors' Society, the Finnish Seamen's Mission, the Norwegian Sj\u00f8mannskirken and the Apostleship of the Sea. They provide cafeterias, cultural and social activities as well as religious services.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nAntwerp is the home of the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC), founded in 1938 and located on the square Grote Markt since 1994.The band dEUS was formed in 1991 in Antwerp. dEUS began their career as a covers band, but soon began writing their own material. Their musical influences range from folk and punk to jazz and progressive rock.\n\n\n=== Music festivals ===\nCultuurmarkt van Vlaanderen is a musical festival and a touristic attraction that takes place annually on the final Sunday of August in the city center of Antwerp. Where international and local musicians and actors, present their stage and street performances.Linkerwoofer is a pop-rock music festival located at the left bank of the Scheldt. This music festival starts in August and mostly local Belgian musicians play and perform in this event.Other popular festivals Fire Is Gold, and focuses more on urban music, and Summerfestival.\n\n\n=== World Choir Games ===\nThe city of Antwerp will co-host the 2020 World Choir Games together with the city of Ghent. Organised by the Interkultur Foundation, the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAntwerp held the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were the first games after the First World War and also the only ones to be held in Belgium. The road cycling events took place in the streets of the city.Royal Antwerp F.C., currently playing in the Belgian First Division, were founded in 1880 and is known as 'The Great Old' for being the first club registered to the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1895. Since 1998, the club has taken Manchester United players on loan in an official partnership. Another club in the city was Beerschot VAC, founded in 1899 by former Royal Antwerp players. They played at the Olympisch Stadion, the main venue of the 1920 Olympics. Nowadays KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk plays at the Olympisch Stadion in the Belgian Second Division.\nThe Antwerp Giants play in Basketball League Belgium and Topvolley Antwerpen play in the Belgium men's volleyball League.\nFor the year 2013, Antwerp was awarded the title of European Capital of Sport.\nAntwerp hosted the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nAntwerp hosted the start of stage 3 of the 2015 Tour de France on 6 July 2015.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\nAntwerp has a university and several colleges. The University of Antwerp  (Universiteit Antwerpen) was established in 2003, following the merger of the RUCA, UFSIA and UIA institutes. Their roots go back to 1852. The University has approximately 23,000 registered students, making it the third-largest university in Flanders, as well as 1,800 foreign students.

          "It's a gorgeous square with detailed buildings all around it. Cobblestone streets, bars, restaurants, tons of people especially on a Friday or Saturday! At sunset the gold details on the buildings catch the light and are just stunning!!",
          "A beautiful square. Be aware though that at the moment much of Antwerp is being renovated so it does look a bit like a building site.",
          "We had a city map and went looking for the Grote Market. We got to where we thought it would be and finally ask one of the waitresses at an outdoor cafe where Grote Market was. She pointed to the street we were on. So we found that the market is a street with lots of shops",
          "I live in Antwerp and its definitely the area where I like to hang around, you find almost everything around that area on walking distance what you need for a perfect day. On the grand place (Grote Markt in the Dutch language) you have all the beautiful old houses around and the",
          "THe houses on the Grote Markt are impressive, unbelievable to think they were ever private residences. The fountain in the middle is very intruiging, be prepared for a brutal scene!",

          "The Grote Markt in Antwerp is inevitably compared to the Brussels Grand-place. And despite the status of the main square of the country comparison is not always in favor of the capital. Here and there is Town Hall. Both are good in their own way. Another important buildings at",

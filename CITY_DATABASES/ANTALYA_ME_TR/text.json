        "wiki": "Antalya (Turkish pronunciation: [an\u02c8talja]) is the fifth-most populous city in Turkey and the capital of Antalya Province. Located on Anatolia's southwest coast bordered by the Taurus Mountains, Antalya is the largest Turkish city on the Mediterranean coast outside the Aegean region with over one million people in its metropolitan area.The city that is now Antalya was first settled around 200 BC by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon, which was soon subdued by the Romans. Roman rule saw Antalya thrive, including the construction of several new monuments, such as Hadrian's Gate, and the proliferation of neighboring cities. The city has changed hands several times, including to the Seljuk Sultanate in 1207 and an expanding Ottoman Empire in 1391. Ottoman rule brought relative peace and stability for the next five hundred years. The city was transferred to Italian suzerainty in the aftermath of World War I, but was recaptured by a newly independent Turkey in the War of Independence.\nAntalya is Turkey's biggest international sea resort, located on the Turkish Riviera. Large-scale development and governmental funding has promoted tourism. A record 12.5 million tourists passed through the city in 2014.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city was founded as \"Attaleia\" (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), named after its founder Attalos II, king of Pergamon. This name, still in use in Greek, was later evolved in Turkish as Adalia and then Antalya. Attaleia was also the name of a festival at Delphi and Attalis (Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c2) was the name of an old Greek tribe at Athens.  Despite the close similarity, there is no connection with the name Anatolia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKing Attalus II of Pergamon is looked on as founder of the city in about 150 BC, during the Hellenistic period. It was named Attaleia or Attalia (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) in his honour. The city served as a naval base for Attalus's powerful fleet. Excavations in 2008, in the Do\u011fu Garaj\u0131 plot, uncovered remains dating to the 3rd century BC, suggesting that Attalea was a rebuilding and expansion of an earlier town.\n\nAttalea became part of the Roman Republic in 133 BC when Attalus III, a nephew of Attalus II bequeathed his kingdom to Rome at his death in 133 BC. The city grew and prospered during the Ancient Roman period and was part of the Roman province of Pamphylia Secunda, whose capital was Perga.\nChristianity started to spread to the region even in the 1st century: Antalya was visited by Paul of Tarsus and Barnabas, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: \"Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, and from there they sailed to Antioch\". Some of the bishops attributed to the episcopal see of Attalea in Pamphylia may instead have been bishops of Attalea in Lydia (Yanantepe), since Le Quien lists them under both sees. No longer a residential bishopric, Attalea in Pamphylia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.The 13th-century Seljuk mosque at Attalea, now in ruins, had been a Christian Byzantine basilica from the 7th century. The Great Mosque had also been a Christian basilica and the Kesik Minare Mosque had been the 5th-century Christian Church of the Panaghia or Virgin and was decorated with finely carved marble. The archaeological museum at Attalia houses some sarcophagi and mosaics from nearby Perga and a casket of bones reputed to be those of St. Nicholas, the bishop of Myra, further down the Turquoise coast.\nAntalya was a major city in the Byzantine Empire. It was the capital of the Byzantine Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots, which occupied the southern coasts of Anatolia. According to the research of Speros Vryonis, it was the major naval station on the southern Anatolian coast, a major commercial center, and the most convenient harbor between the Aegean Sea and Cyprus and points further east. Besides the local merchants, \"one could expect to see Armenians, Saracens, Jews, and Italians.\"At the time of the accession of John II Comnenus in 1118 Antalya was an isolated outpost surrounded by Turkish beyliks, accessible only by sea. Following the fall of Constantinople in 1204, Niketas Choniates records that one Aldebrandus, \"an Italian by birth who was strictly raised according to Roman tradition\" controlled Antalya as his own fief. When Kaykhusraw, sultan of the Seljuk Turks attempted to capture the city in 1206, Aldebrandus sent to Cyprus for help and received 200 Latin infantry who defeated the attackers after a siege of less than 16 days. Kaykhusraw would take Antalya the following year and build its first mosque.. People of Christian were rebelled and captured Antalya with aid of Walter of Montb\u00e9liard in 1212. Briefly restored Byzantine rule in Antalya was ended by Kaykaus I in 1216.\n\nThe city and the surrounding region were conquered by the Seljuk Turks in the early 13th century. Antalya was the capital of the Turkish beylik of Teke (1321\u20131423) until its conquest by the Ottomans, except for a period of Cypriot rule between 1361 and 1373. The Arabic traveler Ibn Battuta, who visited the city in 1335\u20131340, noted:\nFrom Alanya I went to Antaliya [Adalia], a most beautiful city. It covers an immense area, and though of vast bulk is one of the most attractive towns to be seen anywhere, besides being exceedingly populous and well laid out. Each section of the inhabitants lives in a separate quarter. The Christian merchants live in a quarter of the town known as the Mina [the Port], and are surrounded by a wall, the gates of which are shut upon them from without at night and during the Friday service. The Greeks, who were its former inhabitants, live by themselves in another quarter, the Jews in another, and the king and his court and Mamluks in another, each of these quarters being walled off likewise. The rest of the Muslims live in the main city. Round the whole town and all the quarters mentioned there is another great wall. The town contains orchards and produces fine fruits, including an admirable kind of apricot, called by them Qamar ad-Din, which has a sweet almond in its kernel. This fruit is dried and exported to Egypt, where it is regarded as a great luxury.\nIn the second half of the 17th century Evliya \u00c7elebi wrote of a city of narrow streets containing 3,000 houses in 20 Turkish and four Greek neighborhoods. The town had grown beyond the city walls and the port was reported to hold up to 200 boats.\nIn the 19th century, in common with most of Anatolia, its sovereign was a \"dere bey\" (landlord or landowner). The family of Tekke O\u011flu, domiciled near Perge had been reduced to submission in 1812 by Mahmud II, but continued to be a rival power to the Ottoman governor until the early 20th century, surviving by many years the fall of the other great beys of Anatolia. The records of the Levant (Turkey) Company, which maintained an agency in Antalya until 1825, documented the local dere beys.In the early 20th century, Antalya had two factories spinning and weaving cotton. As of 1920, the factories had 15,000 spindles and over 200 looms. A German-owned mill baled cotton. There were gin mills.In the 20th century the population of Antalya increased as Turks from the Caucasus and the Balkans moved into Anatolia. The economy was centered on its port that served the inland areas, particularly Konya. Antalya (then Adalia) was picturesque rather than modern. The chief attraction for visitors was the city wall, and outside a promenade, a portion of which survives. The government offices and the houses of the higher classes were outside the walls.\n\nAs of 1920, Antalya was reported as having a population of approximately 30,000. The harbor was described as small, and unsafe for vessels to visit in the winter. Antalya was exporting wheat, flour, sesame seeds, livestock, timber and charcoal. The latter two were often exported to Egypt and other goods to Italy or other Greek islands, who received mainly flour. In 1920, the city had seven flour mills. Wheat was imported, and then processed in town before exportation. Antalya imported manufactured items, mainly from the United Kingdom.The city had a Greek minority that made up 1/3 of the population until the population exchange.Antalya also had a tiny Armenian population which had a Church on the street of\"Hamam \u00e7ikmazi\"named Hovhannes Surp Garabed,which was later on demolished.Antalya also had a Jewish community which had a tiny Synagogue in the neighborhood of Balbey and a Talmud Tora ,The Synagogue was closed in 1948 and its exact location is not known and the Synagogue might not exist anymore.The Jewish community had 2 graveyards and one was located across \"Donerciler carsisi\"and was demolished when the area was opened to construction ,But one marble tombstone belonging to a Jewish person named Raphael Moshe was transferred to the Antalya Museum where you can see the tombstone in the museums garden.\nThe city was occupied by the Italians from 28 March 1919 to 5 July 1921 during Turkish War of Independence. Large-scale development beginning in the 1970s transformed Antalya from a pastoral town into one of Turkey's largest metropolitan areas. Much of this has been due to tourism, which expanded in the 21st century. In the 1985 singing diva Dalida held her last concert in Antalya.\nAntalya was the host city for the 2015 G-20 summit and the EXPO 2016. Five countries have their consular missions in Antalya including Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Belgium and Serbia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area is shielded from the northerly winds by the Taurus Mountains. Antalya has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with hot and dry summers and mild and rainy winters. Around 300 days of the year are sunny, with nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight per year. The mean sea temperature ranges between 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in winter and 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) in summer. The highest record air temperature reached 45.4 \u00b0C (113.7 \u00b0F) on 1 July 2017 which normally averages as high as 34.4 \u00b0C (93.9 \u00b0F) and the lowest record dropped to \u22124.6 \u00b0C (23.7 \u00b0F) in February, when the low average is as low as 6.1 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the Address-Based Birth Recording System showed a metropolitan population of 1,001,318 (502,491 male; 498,827 female).

Some of these yards have advanced in composites boat building technology.\nCorendon Airlines and SunExpress are headquartered in Antalya.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDespite having architectural heritage dating back up to Hellenistic times, most historical architecture in Antalya date to the medieval Seljuk period, with a number of mosques, madrasahs, masjids, caravanserais, Turkish baths and tombs giving the city a Turkish-Islamic character. Historical architecture is concentrated in the walled city, Kalei\u00e7i; ancient structures are not well-preserved in the rest of the city of Antalya as the modern city was built on the ancient city. Kalei\u00e7i, with its narrow cobbled streets of historic Ottoman era houses, is the old center of Antalya. With its hotels, bars, clubs, restaurants, and shopping, it has been restored to retain much of its historical character. It is surrounded by two walls in the shape of a horsenail, one of which is along the seafront, built in a continuous process from Hellenistic to Ottoman times. The historical harbour is located in this part of the city; narrow streets extend from the harbour and branch off into the old city, surrounded by wooden historical houses. Cumhuriyet Square, the main square of the city and a spot very popular for tourists and locals, is surrounded by shopping and business centres and public buildings. There are sites with traces of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Seljuk architecture and cultures. There are also examples of the local Greek architecture in the city, with five Greek Orthodox churches in the old city.The walled city is surrounded by a large metropolitan area. With high rates of immigration since the 1970s, this area contains large gecekondu neighborhoods that are not well-integrated into the fabric of the city and suffer from poor economic conditions and insufficient education. Gecekondu areas are concentrated in the Kepez district, where an estimated 70% of the houses were gecekondus in 2008. In 2011, it was estimated that there were 50\u201360,000 gecekondus in Antalya, housing around 250,000 people.Antalya has beaches including Konyaalt\u0131, Lara and Karpuzkald\u0131ran.

For general elections, Antalya elects 18 Members of Parliament to the Turkish Grand National Assembly.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\nAntalya has traditionally been seen as a stronghold for the Kemalist centre-left party Republican People's Party (CHP). Being the capital of the fifth most populous province in Turkey, Antalya is politically strategic and has been a target for the governing center-right Justice and Development Party (AKP). The AKP unexpectedly won control of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality in the 2004 local election. The AKP won a plurality in Antalya in the 2007 general election, symbolising the city's political transformation from a CHP stronghold to a CHP-AKP marginal battleground in the 21st century. The loss of Antalya was a major political setback for the CHP not only because of its significance as a centre for tourism, but also because the CHP's former leader Deniz Baykal is a Member of Parliament for the province. The province is divided into 19 districts.\nThe CHP regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2009 local elections, though the AKP won a plurality in the 2011 general election. The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) also have a strong political base in Antalya, winning approximately between 15 and 25% of the vote in elections since 2007. The city voted in favour of the AKP government's proposed constitutional reforms in the 2007 referendum, but voted against the reforms proposed in 2010.\nIn the 2014 local elections, Antalya once again voted for the AKP, with the MHP taking support away from the CHP by winning a record 24.3% of the vote. The CHP subsequently accused the AKP of systematic electoral fraud, and the presence of government minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu at one of the vote counting centres drew strong condemnation. In the 2014 presidential election, the CHP and MHP's joint candidate Ekmeleddin \u0130hsano\u011flu won 53.08% of the vote. The AKP's candidate Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan won 41.63% of the vote, and the HDP democratic socialist candidate Selahattin Demirta\u015f won 5.30% of the vote. Antalya was a hotspot for the 2013\u201314 anti-government protests against the AKP.The secular main opposition, CHP, regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2019 local elections.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe football club of Antalya, Antalyaspor plays in the S\u00fcper Lig.

          "We were in and out in 30mins! I went having read the reviews and being a museum lover, but I guess it's more of a Lone Ranger visit than one with a small baby. Cheaper if you go on your own rather Han an excursion company",
          "This is a fine museum best for its amazing range of Roman/Greek Statues. There are English translations but can be limiting. It's focus is more on ancient history and may have benefitted by giving a bit more history on how this city developed in its later years. Still it is well",

          "We almost did not bother with this Museum but that would have been a great loss. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit and it has some wonderful objects. If anything we thought it should have much better publicity as its world class in its field.",

          "Initially it is just Wow! If you take the time to look carefully and read the blurb attached to many of the artefacts, you get a real sense of time and place. You have to wonder at the work of archiologists; how they manage to decider the tiniest bit of 'something' as anything.",
          "As others have said, museum is well worth the 20Tl entry fee. Amazing sculptures and artifacts. Tip is to catch the tram (10 TL) all day pass. Gets you to the old quarter as well.",

          "Great museum! With lots of Roman history. Love the equipment the museum rent you so you could listen to the history with more details. I would have loved to see some Turk history with the Roman history. Sculptures where reconstructed in a very professional way. Overall I think",
          "Though Antalya Museum may not compare to its peers in different parts of the world, it is still very rich in demonstrating what Anatolia has to share with us... The exhibits could be much more attractive considering the richness of our lands and the number of visitors could be",
          "Plan for at least four hours to see all the amazing exhibits. I would return again and again, if possible.",
          "Museum is very well organized, especially garden part that is beautifull in a special way. Halls are wide and have that touch of the ceremoniously atmosphere and you can really enjoy exhibitions if you are a lover of an ancient history. Apart from showcases with various exhibits",

          "Lovely but not very big, doable in one and a half hours or so if you skip the outdoor part. Loads of impressive stuff from Perge to see. Surprisingly good information in English. Beware, the bathroom after you enter the main exhibit is hiding on the left in the \"glas\" room",

          "Can get the old tram there (end of the line) from the town but walkable in 35 mins from hadriens gate. Lots to see, the carved sarcophagi are quite amazing. There are many statues that have been brought from perge and it is good to see them before you visit the ruined city as",
          "A great to spend time if you are interested in early European history. While a lot of the text is only in Turkish there is enough that isn't to make the visit meaningful. There are no interactive displays or videos so if history isn't your thing there would probably be others",
          "Its a very nice museum. It has some really ancient relics and artifacts. If you are in Antalya and have enough time then should go and visit this museum. It's not free like many other museums around the world but 20 liras is quite worth it.",

          "This is a great attraction for the 20tl entrance price. I recommend the audio guide for another 15tl. The Roman statutes and sarcophagi are some of the best I've seen. It could give the Lourve a run for its money on the Roman statue front. This is a well presented and maintained",

        "wiki": "Antalya (Turkish pronunciation: [an\u02c8talja]) is the fifth-most populous city in Turkey and the capital of Antalya Province. Located on Anatolia's southwest coast bordered by the Taurus Mountains, Antalya is the largest Turkish city on the Mediterranean coast outside the Aegean region with over one million people in its metropolitan area.The city that is now Antalya was first settled around 200 BC by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon, which was soon subdued by the Romans. Roman rule saw Antalya thrive, including the construction of several new monuments, such as Hadrian's Gate, and the proliferation of neighboring cities. The city has changed hands several times, including to the Seljuk Sultanate in 1207 and an expanding Ottoman Empire in 1391. Ottoman rule brought relative peace and stability for the next five hundred years. The city was transferred to Italian suzerainty in the aftermath of World War I, but was recaptured by a newly independent Turkey in the War of Independence.\nAntalya is Turkey's biggest international sea resort, located on the Turkish Riviera. Large-scale development and governmental funding has promoted tourism. A record 12.5 million tourists passed through the city in 2014.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city was founded as \"Attaleia\" (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), named after its founder Attalos II, king of Pergamon. This name, still in use in Greek, was later evolved in Turkish as Adalia and then Antalya. Attaleia was also the name of a festival at Delphi and Attalis (Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c2) was the name of an old Greek tribe at Athens.  Despite the close similarity, there is no connection with the name Anatolia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKing Attalus II of Pergamon is looked on as founder of the city in about 150 BC, during the Hellenistic period. It was named Attaleia or Attalia (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) in his honour. The city served as a naval base for Attalus's powerful fleet. Excavations in 2008, in the Do\u011fu Garaj\u0131 plot, uncovered remains dating to the 3rd century BC, suggesting that Attalea was a rebuilding and expansion of an earlier town.\n\nAttalea became part of the Roman Republic in 133 BC when Attalus III, a nephew of Attalus II bequeathed his kingdom to Rome at his death in 133 BC. The city grew and prospered during the Ancient Roman period and was part of the Roman province of Pamphylia Secunda, whose capital was Perga.\nChristianity started to spread to the region even in the 1st century: Antalya was visited by Paul of Tarsus and Barnabas, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: \"Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, and from there they sailed to Antioch\". Some of the bishops attributed to the episcopal see of Attalea in Pamphylia may instead have been bishops of Attalea in Lydia (Yanantepe), since Le Quien lists them under both sees. No longer a residential bishopric, Attalea in Pamphylia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.The 13th-century Seljuk mosque at Attalea, now in ruins, had been a Christian Byzantine basilica from the 7th century. The Great Mosque had also been a Christian basilica and the Kesik Minare Mosque had been the 5th-century Christian Church of the Panaghia or Virgin and was decorated with finely carved marble. The archaeological museum at Attalia houses some sarcophagi and mosaics from nearby Perga and a casket of bones reputed to be those of St. Nicholas, the bishop of Myra, further down the Turquoise coast.\nAntalya was a major city in the Byzantine Empire. It was the capital of the Byzantine Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots, which occupied the southern coasts of Anatolia. According to the research of Speros Vryonis, it was the major naval station on the southern Anatolian coast, a major commercial center, and the most convenient harbor between the Aegean Sea and Cyprus and points further east. Besides the local merchants, \"one could expect to see Armenians, Saracens, Jews, and Italians.\"At the time of the accession of John II Comnenus in 1118 Antalya was an isolated outpost surrounded by Turkish beyliks, accessible only by sea. Following the fall of Constantinople in 1204, Niketas Choniates records that one Aldebrandus, \"an Italian by birth who was strictly raised according to Roman tradition\" controlled Antalya as his own fief. When Kaykhusraw, sultan of the Seljuk Turks attempted to capture the city in 1206, Aldebrandus sent to Cyprus for help and received 200 Latin infantry who defeated the attackers after a siege of less than 16 days. Kaykhusraw would take Antalya the following year and build its first mosque.. People of Christian were rebelled and captured Antalya with aid of Walter of Montb\u00e9liard in 1212. Briefly restored Byzantine rule in Antalya was ended by Kaykaus I in 1216.\n\nThe city and the surrounding region were conquered by the Seljuk Turks in the early 13th century. Antalya was the capital of the Turkish beylik of Teke (1321\u20131423) until its conquest by the Ottomans, except for a period of Cypriot rule between 1361 and 1373. The Arabic traveler Ibn Battuta, who visited the city in 1335\u20131340, noted:\nFrom Alanya I went to Antaliya [Adalia], a most beautiful city. It covers an immense area, and though of vast bulk is one of the most attractive towns to be seen anywhere, besides being exceedingly populous and well laid out. Each section of the inhabitants lives in a separate quarter. The Christian merchants live in a quarter of the town known as the Mina [the Port], and are surrounded by a wall, the gates of which are shut upon them from without at night and during the Friday service. The Greeks, who were its former inhabitants, live by themselves in another quarter, the Jews in another, and the king and his court and Mamluks in another, each of these quarters being walled off likewise. The rest of the Muslims live in the main city. Round the whole town and all the quarters mentioned there is another great wall. The town contains orchards and produces fine fruits, including an admirable kind of apricot, called by them Qamar ad-Din, which has a sweet almond in its kernel. This fruit is dried and exported to Egypt, where it is regarded as a great luxury.\nIn the second half of the 17th century Evliya \u00c7elebi wrote of a city of narrow streets containing 3,000 houses in 20 Turkish and four Greek neighborhoods. The town had grown beyond the city walls and the port was reported to hold up to 200 boats.\nIn the 19th century, in common with most of Anatolia, its sovereign was a \"dere bey\" (landlord or landowner). The family of Tekke O\u011flu, domiciled near Perge had been reduced to submission in 1812 by Mahmud II, but continued to be a rival power to the Ottoman governor until the early 20th century, surviving by many years the fall of the other great beys of Anatolia. The records of the Levant (Turkey) Company, which maintained an agency in Antalya until 1825, documented the local dere beys.In the early 20th century, Antalya had two factories spinning and weaving cotton. As of 1920, the factories had 15,000 spindles and over 200 looms. A German-owned mill baled cotton. There were gin mills.In the 20th century the population of Antalya increased as Turks from the Caucasus and the Balkans moved into Anatolia. The economy was centered on its port that served the inland areas, particularly Konya. Antalya (then Adalia) was picturesque rather than modern. The chief attraction for visitors was the city wall, and outside a promenade, a portion of which survives. The government offices and the houses of the higher classes were outside the walls.\n\nAs of 1920, Antalya was reported as having a population of approximately 30,000. The harbor was described as small, and unsafe for vessels to visit in the winter. Antalya was exporting wheat, flour, sesame seeds, livestock, timber and charcoal. The latter two were often exported to Egypt and other goods to Italy or other Greek islands, who received mainly flour. In 1920, the city had seven flour mills. Wheat was imported, and then processed in town before exportation. Antalya imported manufactured items, mainly from the United Kingdom.The city had a Greek minority that made up 1/3 of the population until the population exchange.Antalya also had a tiny Armenian population which had a Church on the street of\"Hamam \u00e7ikmazi\"named Hovhannes Surp Garabed,which was later on demolished.Antalya also had a Jewish community which had a tiny Synagogue in the neighborhood of Balbey and a Talmud Tora ,The Synagogue was closed in 1948 and its exact location is not known and the Synagogue might not exist anymore.The Jewish community had 2 graveyards and one was located across \"Donerciler carsisi\"and was demolished when the area was opened to construction ,But one marble tombstone belonging to a Jewish person named Raphael Moshe was transferred to the Antalya Museum where you can see the tombstone in the museums garden.\nThe city was occupied by the Italians from 28 March 1919 to 5 July 1921 during Turkish War of Independence. Large-scale development beginning in the 1970s transformed Antalya from a pastoral town into one of Turkey's largest metropolitan areas. Much of this has been due to tourism, which expanded in the 21st century. In the 1985 singing diva Dalida held her last concert in Antalya.\nAntalya was the host city for the 2015 G-20 summit and the EXPO 2016. Five countries have their consular missions in Antalya including Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Belgium and Serbia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area is shielded from the northerly winds by the Taurus Mountains. Antalya has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with hot and dry summers and mild and rainy winters. Around 300 days of the year are sunny, with nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight per year. The mean sea temperature ranges between 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in winter and 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) in summer.

Historical architecture is concentrated in the walled city, Kalei\u00e7i; ancient structures are not well-preserved in the rest of the city of Antalya as the modern city was built on the ancient city. Kalei\u00e7i, with its narrow cobbled streets of historic Ottoman era houses, is the old center of Antalya. With its hotels, bars, clubs, restaurants, and shopping, it has been restored to retain much of its historical character. It is surrounded by two walls in the shape of a horsenail, one of which is along the seafront, built in a continuous process from Hellenistic to Ottoman times. The historical harbour is located in this part of the city; narrow streets extend from the harbour and branch off into the old city, surrounded by wooden historical houses. Cumhuriyet Square, the main square of the city and a spot very popular for tourists and locals, is surrounded by shopping and business centres and public buildings. There are sites with traces of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Seljuk architecture and cultures. There are also examples of the local Greek architecture in the city, with five Greek Orthodox churches in the old city.The walled city is surrounded by a large metropolitan area. With high rates of immigration since the 1970s, this area contains large gecekondu neighborhoods that are not well-integrated into the fabric of the city and suffer from poor economic conditions and insufficient education. Gecekondu areas are concentrated in the Kepez district, where an estimated 70% of the houses were gecekondus in 2008.

Being the capital of the fifth most populous province in Turkey, Antalya is politically strategic and has been a target for the governing center-right Justice and Development Party (AKP). The AKP unexpectedly won control of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality in the 2004 local election. The AKP won a plurality in Antalya in the 2007 general election, symbolising the city's political transformation from a CHP stronghold to a CHP-AKP marginal battleground in the 21st century. The loss of Antalya was a major political setback for the CHP not only because of its significance as a centre for tourism, but also because the CHP's former leader Deniz Baykal is a Member of Parliament for the province. The province is divided into 19 districts.\nThe CHP regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2009 local elections, though the AKP won a plurality in the 2011 general election.

The city voted in favour of the AKP government's proposed constitutional reforms in the 2007 referendum, but voted against the reforms proposed in 2010.\nIn the 2014 local elections, Antalya once again voted for the AKP, with the MHP taking support away from the CHP by winning a record 24.3% of the vote. The CHP subsequently accused the AKP of systematic electoral fraud, and the presence of government minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu at one of the vote counting centres drew strong condemnation. In the 2014 presidential election, the CHP and MHP's joint candidate Ekmeleddin \u0130hsano\u011flu won 53.08% of the vote. The AKP's candidate Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan won 41.63% of the vote, and the HDP democratic socialist candidate Selahattin Demirta\u015f won 5.30% of the vote. Antalya was a hotspot for the 2013\u201314 anti-government protests against the AKP.The secular main opposition, CHP, regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2019 local elections.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe football club of Antalya, Antalyaspor plays in the S\u00fcper Lig.

In 2010, the city planned to increase from 40 to 140 more buses.Payment for public transportation was made in cash until the launch of a public transportation card, Antkart, in late 2007.

          "This aquarium was a real disappointment to me. I expected something out of this world...dolphins, tuna, more interaction, optional dive opportunities...especially for this expensive cost. Mostly dark interior and not a wide variety of fish. Dubai Mall, Chengdu aquarium,",
          "We were here with our friends and elderly children. 9 and 12 y.o. It s a good escape from the hotel routine in Antalya, not far from Kemer region about an hour of drive. Interesting species and design.",
          "Went on a 2 hour trip, was ok for an hour, good, clean and very well looked after. Enjoyed our time there.",
          "This was truly a wonderful experience. The tunnels are beautiful. Plenty different species of fish to be seen. Shark feeding took place at 12pm. Extremely clean and worth every cent.",
          "There were some works in the tunnel as well in the last room. They should do a discount for this and not charge the full price which is anyway too expensive for that what you get!",
          "Been to aquarium...it was good experience.specialy for young kids..happy to see lots of different kind of fishes.and face to face was good aswell .same place...\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Except for the fact that the XD cinema presentation was ridiculous and unduly scary, the aquarium was pleasant enough. The tunnel is impressive for the number of sting rays, and our toddler was delighted. But there was nothing truly unique about the place. And for what it was,",
          "Kids love it, probably our 5th visit, look online before to see if any offers and you can also get a combi ticket to visit the other attractions in the same building such as wild park or the snow world. Also if you check feeding times you may get to see them feeding the sharks.",
          "We paid 58 Euros via Tripadvisor for two tickets being there on our own. The aquarium is very small even though it's the \"biggest tunnel aquarium\" in the world doesn't mean it's big altogether. After maybe 30 minutes you've seen everything, we were surprised about how fast we",
          "We visited this attraction in July 2019 as part of our TUI Antalya/Aquarium Excursion (TUI Family Life Kaya Side.) This was an absolute highlight of our holiday. The Aquarium is extremely good and easily rivals many of the Aquariums found back in the United Kingdom. We then",
          "Firstly I need to point out if you are not a Turkish resident it will cost you 7x the price it costs a Turkish resident this is an excessive tax for being a visitor to Turkey and if the compliment was returned and we charged Turkish 7x the cost for a ticket to a local attraction",
          "The aquarium was okay but grossly overpriced been in a lot more which are cheaper and far, far better, ie Dubai. It is very lacking, wouldn't recommend. Also went to 3D cinema which was a joke. Restaurant/cafe was good.",
          "The aquarium is nice if you've never visited one before. But go to your average zoo and you will find at least similar aquariums there. I doubt the claim \"world's lbiggest tunnel aquarium\" is right. It may be in meters length, but for sure the aquarium itself is not very large /",
          "Good but not great. If you have young kids they will enjoy the tunnel which is claimed to be the longest in the world. Entrance is 38 euro (2019).",
          "I kept my expectations on low, but it was unnecessary, because the place rocks. Chain of aquariums, nicely lit. Huge tunnel aquarium. Kid was astonished, and me and my wife very much surprised.",
          "The Anatalya Aquarium is well laid out; numerous (over 40) tanks provide glimpses of local sea life. The water was crystal clear, and the fish seemed well cared for. I most enjoyed the walk-through tunnel (131m long) under an enormous tank while some fairly large fish",
          "55$/person for an aquarium visit and an 8 minutes movie in 4D? No thanks. These are tourist prices, probably not the regular ones. More expensive than very good aquariums in Germany and other European countries.",
          "The aquarium is very good. It's on par with such kind of aquariums of the world's largest cities. It does have a decent variety of fish, including some types of sharks.",
          "This is one of two cable cars in Antalya and the smaller of the two, closer to the center of the city. We spent a calm morning up the mountain. The ride was really pleasant slowly going up the mountain you could see the whole of Antalya. Once we got to the top of the mountain",
          "superbe sea life views, fishes from all over the world, superbe presentations, like a dream in the tunnel",
          "We payed to enter the aquarium and snow park. The aquarium is nice, it claims to have the longest tunnel in the world which left us with the impression that it was going to be a lot bigger than what it was, however to explore the whole aquarium at a slow place took about 30",
          "Really nice experience very nice facility worth visiting.... A lot of sea life and beautifull old structures",

          "Didn't end up going in here after travelling all the way there and finding out you can only pay in Dollars and is very overpriced. It would have cost over $70 just to visit the aquarium and if we wanted to do anything else there then they are extra. The building is stunning and",
          "Beautiful experience. Went with partner here while on trip to Turkey. We absolutely loved it. The Aquarium tunnel, the entertaining divers and the bits of historical and geographical information all made it worthwhile",
          "It certainly was well constructed and very interesting to walk round but I do think it was very expensive. If the other site options like the reptile house and ice world were part of the admission I would have felt it was worth the admission price.",
          "The aquarium has a good range of fish & other creatures but $35 a person for something that only takes an hour to walk round is quite a lot should be more like $20 each",
          "35 USD for an adult and the gift shop is even worse. The place is not very big, and in the main tunnel you are not blown away from variety and quantity",
          "Very small very crowded very expensive. Boasted a lot but was over in a few minutes. So many people hard to see anything.",
          "The place complicated to find! anyway nice but to expensive, we come from belek there! Paid also taxi to expensive!",
          "Visited the aquarium and found the experience very good however at \u00a375 for 2 adults and one child found it very expensive as completed the tour in 90 mins and not worth the entry price for the time spent there .",
          "Maybe Istanbul aquarium is better. Haven\u2019t visited Istanbul aquarium but that\u2019s what we heard. There was also a reptile museum along with the Antalya aquarium. We took a package. The reptile part was also ok. They had many snakes and other reptiles.",
          "This is a good option only when it's raining. The aquarium is in Antalya, so you must expect long transfers. Now talking about the aquarium itself: new construction, nice ideea with large and beautiful made tanks, very long tunnel (but it's not continuous, there are gaps). For",

          "I've been to many aquariums, the tunnel in this one is absolutely amazing and goes on for ages. There are loads of sharks and it would be a fantastic place to take anyone interested in sea life. You see sharks and rays just floating above your head. Unfortunately in some",

The full package to visit all the activities ( and I do RECOMMEND to buy a \u2757\ufe0ffull package ticket \u2757\ufe0f) 70$/Adt, 54$/CHd. You will definitely enjoy it.",
          "Aside from the tunnel that is spectacular by itself and is fun to walk through, (if you are lucky not to go with dozens of other visitors) the rest of it was a bit disappointing. The exhibitions were poor, not very informational, so people don't stay longer than a few seconds.",
          "Had a great time. we all enjoyed the visit. definitely recommend to go kids will enjoy it. Loved the tunnel.",
          "It was an OK visit to see this Aquarium, however is not very big, depending how fast you walk you might finish it off in an hour or an hour and half. The beginning of the tour have few water tanks than the tunnel is around 100 metres long and at the end of the tunnel is the",
          "Verry poor exhibition and verry expensive for what you can see. We are disapointed. I do not recomand",
          "It was a good experince as a family visit. We visited on Tuesday, no long queue. A very expensive gift shop as usual. The enttance fee was expensive. 32 euros per peron, a bit cheper for children. It took about 2 hours to visit. The big tunnel was the most exciting part I guess.",
          "It you are a fan of sea world you will enjoy it. It is very peaceful inside. Don't forget to tlread the info about each one.",
          "The equivalent of being served fish fingers at a Michelin restaurant, good because it's got a good presentation, but crappy because it's the same fish just pooping in a longer pond... Like a bad tinder date, when he brags about how long it will take and lo and behold, it's over",
          "Very bizarre tourist attraction. Foreign tourists and Turkish citizens treated unequally. Tourists pay 7 times as much entrance fee - $ 35 versus $ 5 for Turkish citizens. Such discrimination would be illegal in EU or USA. Also, souvenir/gift shop is a TOTAL RIPOFF. No",
          "Good decoration in aquariums but the price of ticket is very much for it. I spent about 1,5h for all aquariums. Really nothing interesting for this money.",
          "Diversity of fishes and other sea creatures, the tunnel is lovely with many, small sharks & stingrays that are so cute and soooo active, the stingrays seems like smiling all the time, they are so beautiful...",
          "We paid the full package to let the kids enjoy to the max ( 248 usd )but unfortunately the snow area was too small, not providing full uniform so you cannot stay more than ten minutes. The wild park was only for reptiles and within ten minutes was done . The cinema Xd was also",
          "The aquarium entrance and individual fish tanks are fantastic. The longest under water tunnel in the world...has something missing...the missing thing being fish! The poor thing about the place is the price of the gift shops. 35TL for a Starbucks cold coffee left me shocked",
          "The site includes four activities: Aquarium Snow museum Wild park XCinema We bought an all-inclusive tickets for all at $70 per adult- and a little less for under5. The aquarium and snow museum were a great experience; the xcinema and wild park were not worth it. Only one of",
          "We were hesitant to go at first, but we had a wonderful time, a variety of fish, the setting is professional and well maintained, the tunnel.is long and beautiful.",
          "Its nice place there are differnt type of fish and nice tunnel aquarium it wont take more thN one hr if u really walk slow and enjoy the seen i think its overpriced for tourists but resonable price for nationals unless u havent been to any other aquarium its not a must see ..",
          "Not worth the money. Customer service is poor, no English speakers and shop inside Aquarium is rip off. Shop assistance is rude.",
          "I personally wasn\u2019t impressed much with this experience it was expensive compared to the amount of time u spend there The aquarium can be fully visited in less than 30min And you pay around 30$ If you want the full experience the package would cost you around 70 or 80$",
          "The tickets for this were expensive and for the Aquarium and Snow World, it cost $50 per adult. Comparing the size and facility of the Aquarium to others that I\u2019ve to, it\u2019s not worth going. There were very few interesting fish species and all the coral was artificial and we",
          "Nice experience. It is Worth a try. The cildren were delighted and so were we. If you are in Antalya you have to visit it.",
          "Antalya Aquarium is the real deal if you are a nature freak. Although it is not really accessible and convenient, but it is worth the effort. Check out the transfer options and take one that suits you best.SET ASIDE SOME 3 HOURS to enjoy the lavish life and abundance of marine",
          "Went there with my kids , prices are fairly good . Nice place highly recommended for families with kids as you get their attention to marine life , dolphins , turtles .",
          "Came here in July 2019 while stopping in the wind of lara the children loved it here there is so much to see and do the underwater walk way is great and a nice touch Bad points Staff are rude and quite snappy when talking to you which isn't good!",
          "Ive been to a few aquariums in various cities and was expecting more from the one in Antalya after seeing the advertising. It wasn\u2019t bad i just thought it would be better. Nice to escape the hot weather outside though :)",
          "The aquarium is a very nice place to visit and you will enjoy it, but the snow world is very small and does not worth the money or the time.",
          "There was no hotel pickup arranged, consequently I wasted my money as I was unable to go on the cable car. Poor communication from the tour operator and it really messed up my plans! Would not recommend.",
          "Excellent location to visit for both: adults and childrens. It is the second time that we visit the aquarium and we will see it next year too.",
          "Do not, I repeat, do not pay the exhorbitant prices to see a poor aquarium.The sharks are tiny little things, the shark feeding, supposed the highlight, is a joke as the divers enter at the main viewing area and promptly swim off to another spot in the tank away from the",
          "Visited the aquarium last year in August, it was a good experience, the tickets were somewhat expensive but it\u2019s ok if it was the first time. Actually I expected to see more types of sea creatures, more diversity, I expected to see crabs, jellyfish, lobsters and so on. But I",
          "Visited rhe aquarium with my 3yo, its nice but very busy so you cant actually see all the fish . You can feed the Coy fish for 2\u20ac. The tunnel is really nice and once outside in-front of the wild life you can take pix with an huge Ara for inly 7\u20ac",
          "A wonderful experience. It\u2019s not cheap but when you get in you can see why. It\u2019s beautiful. Sharks and rays galore! We went at night around 9pm and there was only one other family there! Definitely the way to go, you have the freedom to walk around and really relax, spend lots",
          "Having heard this has the largest walk through aquarium expected great things. Slightly disappointed though, the large walk through aquarium is big but not very diverse, mainly rays, a couple of different sharks and guitar fish. Been to other aquariums with a much larger range",
          "I have 3 children ages, 7, 11 and 15.. the aquarium was nicely arranged and there were some interesting fish. My kids loved the tunnel and sharks the most, they also liked feeding the fish, using small bottles, that was a big hit with them as the fish would actually suck at the",
          "Aquarium, snow museum and wild park Plus 4d cinema It is one of the best experiences on the city But expensive 70 usd for all attractions 35 for aquarium and 20 for others",
          "Expensive entrance fee. Large tunnel, interesting display. Very good thematic displays. Excellent design on the inside, and impressive architecture on the outside. However, although there is a large number (some 200) of sharks displayed, it clearly lacks larger examples of the",
          "For the price it is not worth going! The aquatic selection is not very big although I did like the themes of the water tanks. It didn't take long to get around and the longest tunnel that they advertise is just ok",
          "It is a good aquarium as in there are lots of fish, sharks etc however they need more tropical fish. They have the longest aquarium tunnel in the world, that is an interesting thing to experience. The price is around \u00a326, which is a lot for what is there. I would say they",
          "A brilliant day out for all the family. A possible downside is that having paid the entrance fee for the aquarium there is an additional charge of 15\u20ac for each of the other attractions. On the plus side it means that you can tailor your visit to personal choice. There are",
          "The Aquarium Is one of the best abd largest in the world and has difrent sections to view i was so pleased to visit it with my wife.",
          "Aquarium pretty much the same as most. Long tunnel though. TUI trip with obligatory \"sales\" stops spoilt it. Travel comfortable and veryhelpful driver though.",
          "From Belek it takes some one hour to get to the location, via the provided transfer. Some two hours are enough to see the aquarium, taking your time. Nice tanks and a very nice large tank and the underwater tunnel. It's a must for children and parents see cool things too so",
          "Worth doing, the views are spectacular, try and make sure you choose a clear day. Most of the trips seem to allow for approx 1.5 hrs on the mountain top. We had approx 20 minute queue for cable car.",
          "Hello to everyone, we was there with my family in April (Easter time). It was a amazing trip! we didn't want to take a tour company. Because; it was very expensive if you are more than two person. We rent a car from outside hotel, because inside hotel everything more expensive.",
          "We paid for the full access to the Aquarium, That included the Snow room, Reptile house and 3d ride as well as the aquarium. It was like AUD $90 each. Very expensive for the experience. The aquarium was good, but i wouldnt say great, and the other areas were ok. Wish we had not",
          "Visited this on our last day booked through jet2 which i wouldnt recommended as spent 2 hours in a gold and leather store before hand. Anyway loved this place takes around 45mins to get round lots to see and if you want you can visit the other attractions. We done the reptile",
          "The tunnel was really nice, but my overall expectations from the place were much higher. The aquarium loses much, because all the water tanks (with 2-3 exceptions) have a completely artificial environment: no water plants, no shellfish, or corals, or anemones, or starfish.",
          "It was a good trip with fishes :) Tunnel was so good and excited.You can go with parents and good time...",
          "Very average aquarium. Nothing like the Dubai one. Limited selection of fishes with poor description. Didn\u2019t find anything great to enjoy.",
          "We visited Aquarium today as the weather wasnt good for swimming. It was worth it. We bought tickets online (2 kids and 2 adults)103\u20ac. Very nice a lot of to see. Seriously the longest tunnel with sharks, piranhas and etc.",
          "Very nice to visit with big variety of fishes kinds, 4 XD cinema . Jungle toor and lot of facilities , ticket for aquarium + XD Cinema 45 $ per person.",
          "Quite a small aquarium, took less than 45 minutes to go theough the whole thing slowly with three young children. $35 an adult and only a tiny bit cheaper for children 2-12 years. Have visited much more interesting aquariums in other places that are significantly cheapers. Staff",
          "Fantastic aquarium with a large gift shop, in built Mac Donald\u2019s and Mado Ice Cream which were highlights for our three and four year olds! Keeps family busy for a few hours. There was also reptile house and snow land but we did not enter as our kids were tired.",
          "It was great to see the world's longest tunnel aquarium, the design, the multiple choice of the fish world. Was a great choice. Fully recommend it",
          "Kids loved seeing the array of creatures and fishes on show. Sharks, octopuses sting rays and eels. A must see if with kids. Also has the largest indoor tunnel.",
          "aquarium expensive overall didnt think it was value for money not the largest fish i have seen in an aquarium cinema experience very poor (dont waste your money) all staff miserable would not recommend visiting overall about one hour is enough to cover trip",
          "This aquarium is a place to spend a an hour or two. The displays are gorgeous and the fish are interesting. Watch out for the giant Asian fish... The tunnel is a wonderland of magic. The shark feeding viewing area is too small for visitors to enjoy. This location shoudk be",
          "Booked through trip advisor told on information pack you get shuttle will be at your hotel about 9.30 - 10.00 am nothing turns up ring up the aquarium. To be told the shuttle only operates on Tuesday. This is wrong and they are selling the wrong information!!",
          "The aquarium has some great innovative displays with scenes set out where the fish swim about. Its lovely. So like an underwater old city or an underwater plane just to name a couple. It also has the worlds biggest tunnel. The lighting is fab too as used really well through",
          "Visited the aquarium with my wife and son while staying in Antalya. The online booking was easy and straightforward, tickets were valid for up to a week from the date of booking, and check-in was quite fast. The staff were representable and friendly, and all spoke good English.",
          "We paid \u20ac40 pp to enter the aquarium, whilst it boast the longest tunnel aquarium, the variety of fish to see was very limited. There were additional areas to visit that required extra fees to be paid. The whole aquarium could be seen within 20-30 minutes. Personally, we felt it",
          "We wanted to visit the aquarium with 5 persons. First they show us prices in dollar (40 dollar per adult). We insisted to have regular prices. They show us the price on a calculator and indicates 220 TL. They refused to show me official prices in TL. We found out that Turkish",
          "For an aquarium only ticket for our family this was a huge disappointment. Very expensive, not many fish, over in a flash and you are straight into the gift shop. Don\u2019t do it.",
          "Visited as part of my sisters hen holiday. Such a nice tranquil place, plenty of amazing fish and different species of sealife to see, we were lucky enough to be there for the shark feeding, great to see the divers feeding the sharks and stingrays and at times you can see them",
          "to see a full plane,mini car,submarine being used as artifacts for the marine aquarium was really clever great to know that they have the longest tunnel for the aquarium in the world as we were told but a really good couple of hours was spent here not only in the aquarium but",
          "We visited the aquarium as we were told it had the longest tunnel in the world. Cost \u00a350 each, children under 3 are free. Nothing spectacular. Clean and friendly.",
          "The aquarium is a little bit out of town so by the time we got there, we were somewhat committed. The entry price was ridiculous, with extra to pay if you want to tickle lizards or do the 'submarine' cinema... Das Boot is on netflix. It's a lot cheaper to watch that. They",
          "Lovely aquarium but feel most of the tunnel tank that is in there lacks of sharks and fish. The other tank on the way round had plenty of fish but feel To improve they will have to fill tunnel tank a bit better.",
          "We came here today, paid \u00a3100 for 3 of us (700TRY). Thought it must be good with that price, what a total let down! Never been to a worse aquarium, even the blue reef in england is better and thats rubbish also. It took us no longer than half an hour, maybe 45 mins to get",
          "So as you can tell I think this place is amazing. Me, wife and daughter years old have been there in February. We loved the sharks and ray fish. Great place, claiming to have a biggest tunnel in the world. Tickets are expensive but well worth it",
          "Nice place for kids but a bit expensive. It would be better if both wildpark and aquarium could be visited with same ticket.",
          "Good for a visit with family. Central Location. Shark section is very fun. Facilities for eating are mediocre.",
          "Wandered along from Kaleici and spotted the Aquarium and thought might be about \u00a320. Group of 4 Turkish adults and kid ahead in the queue. Asked the price and surly guy pointed to Laminated price list in dollars: $35 for Aquarium/ asked how much in Turkish lira would have",
          "It is really shamefull, that if you're not a local, you need to pay 5 times more!!! We're the same as turkish people, we should all be EQUAL around the world! Why do the locals need to pay only around 6$, while tourists are asked to pay around 33$?! Just to see an aquarium??!!!",
          "This facility charges foreigners MUCH more than Turkish people for entrance. They wanted $35 for entry and another $10 for an 8 minute movie. When I reluctantly agreed, they couldn\u2019t accept my Visa card from another country. Don\u2019t bother with this place. It is a rip off.",
          "We have visited several aquariums so far, but Antalya aquarium is the most beautiful and complete until now. The entrance price is not so cheap, but it worth. We had a combined ticket (aquarium+terrarium) and the animals were extraordinary. Indeed, the water tunnel is big and",
          "had a lovely day out at aquarium although pricey with \u00a3150 for 4 of us that included the cinema experience. the fish descriptions were amazing on the walls the scenery was up to scratch and the photographers did a great job to. ~sharon~",
          "Very interesting both for adults and kids. Educational tour and tunnel is beautiful with lots of \ud83e\udd88 sharks \ud83e\udd88",
          "The weather in Antalya was rainy and we had one day left in Turkey. So we decided to visit the aquarium which looks quite impressive from the outside. We parked in a lot that was fairly empty. Approaching the building is a large sign saying \u201cinformation\u201d and in a little smaller",
          "great way to spend a day for both couples and families alike with something for everyone .Can be a bit pricey if a big party ,but it has lots of reptiles from all over the world with alot of info .It boasts a really good tunnel which i must say i was impressed with ,plenty of",
          "The place is big and nice decorated, has interesting ideas of different countries expositions but there are not many kinds of fishes to see, in the tunnel which is claimed to be biggest in Europe are not many inhabitants, you just walk into emptyness, so basically half hour",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the aquarium. Many many different species of aquatic animals. We went during the week and it was not busy at all. The price was good as well.",
          "Me and my son visited here as part of a Thomas Cook trip and trip included entry to Aquarium only, we were then charged \u00a310 each for Reptile house, again for snow room. This was also charged for the 4d video working out over \u00a350 each. You could do all of this in 2-3hrs it's not",
          "The place was overpriced. I think the price different between Turkish residents and tourists is crazy. It is over 4 times more expensive. If it was just me I would have turned away once I found out how expensive it is for tourists but I was with the wife. It is 33USD for",
          "According to the online review which I have seen from online about expensive entrance ticket makes me think twice before visiting this aquarium. However finally i decided to visit there. There is Mc. Donalds near by the aquarium, and also small but beautiful coffee shop. Once I",
          "It doesn't worth the money you give. Aquarium is very big, no problem with that but there aren't so impressive and big fishes. We have expected to see a big (or not small) shark or dolphin at least.",
          "fantasket time it has the longest glass tunnel in the world well warth a viset there two other attractions ice musuem and insects you will love them or hat them",
          "This was a nice trip, but incredibly overpriced for a small aquarium. We said if we ever visit Antalya again, we'd avoid it! It was very small and the kids liked it, but not really worth so much money.",
          "The aquarium and reprtile park are brilliant.! Lots of fish and reptiles to see. The longest tunnel is great and definitely the highlight of the aquarium. Only 3 stars due to the cost (\u00a3200) for a family of 4 is rediculous and the staff d9nt speak English and make no effort to",
          "Of cause this is not Barcelona Aquarium but it is also a nice place with a lot of fishes from all seas and oceans of the world. Sharks, piranhas, coral fishes and many others. Territory is small - max 1 hour visit in slow pace. Trip itself is much longer so either ask your guide",
          "The Anatalya Aquarium very highly publicised venue in Anatalya but there are NOT MUCH aquarium stuff to be there to be seen only few type species. NOT VALUE FOR MONEY. NOT WOTH VISITING.",
          "To the General Management: I was with my 74 y.o. mum at the end of the day when lady called Rosa Mamadova, a sales from souvenir shop was sent \u2018to let people know it\u2019s the end of the visit\u2019. Rosa Mamadova immediately, as she heard me speaking Russian with mum, started shouting",
          "Had a great time with my daughters. The aquarium has the largest water tunnel and is very well presented. Plenty of fish and information to keep you and family busy. Bonus is it also has a reptile park which is very good. There was also a couple of other attractions but we",
          "We book a trip to the aquarium through our hotel which was the cheapest way we could find to do it which include the transfer. It was a pleasant drive up to the aquarium, around one hour forty-five minutes. However we were the only English people on the bus and the tour guide",
          "Really a good place not to miss if you visit Antalya. Its worth to visit with longest tunnel compared to Dubai Acquarium. Its very clean and kids enjoyed a lot",
          "Hi i just done this tour and i want people read this. TOUR OPERATORS METIN TOUR. I did phone viator to make sure they can pick us from hotel while i was in uk. After 30 mins wating they said they fine. When i call to ask where the free boattrip they said dont it and said lucky",
          "Touted to be the longest tunnel aquarium in the world, this place lacks diversity in terms of aquatic life on display. Though they have an impressive collection of sharks, the lack of other non-piscean species, like Octopuses, turtles, sea-horse etc. is striking, in-spite of the",
          "aqua world is the worst attraction I have ever visited. place was filthy half the slides didn't work and staff are RUDE!!! avoid at all costs this place is not what is advertised. the way they look after the place is dreadful and going by that I cant imagine they look after the",
          "It was a nice visit and the tunnel is great. I've seen better though and the ticket price is really high. But as you don't have that many attractions in the area, the aquarium is a good option if you travel with kids",
          "Visited yesterday and found the experience very good. It took us around 2 hours to view the aquarium, including seeing the sharks being fed. The admission price is too expensive though. 2 prices, 1 for tourists and 1 for Turks. We were lucky, we produced our TRNC driving",
          "It,s good place to visit with family. Can make good pictures and spend pleasant time. In 12:00 they have \u201cShark feeding\u201d. The prices are different for local people and tourists.",
          "Not the biggest place ,but a lovely example of how these places should be done . Excellent tunnel ,great shop and reptile house,maybe could have been slightly bigger. But a decent day out .",
          "A place for Kids. Nothing special, not so cheap..... To short for a visit indeed... It was a trip with Guide.",
          "When you are visiting Antalya ,this is a place for you and family to do not miss from your agenda to spend the time. Recommend it",
          "The Aquarium is nothing special. The best part is the tunnel. Not worth the price they are charging! Also found it a big con that you have to pay extra if you want to visit the reptile house and Snowworld. The reptile house is small and doesn\u2019t take long to see and should be",
          "Went there with my family around noon to escape the hot sun and get some activity in an indoor air conditioned place :-) If u are in Kalei\u00e7i , it is reachable by taxi and the drive costs around 25TL only. The entrance price is not cheap though. This aquarium claims to have the",
          "Costing over \u00a3100 for 2 adults and a child we found this place expensive. We were in and out in just over an hour and it really isn't great value for money. Some of the displays are nice, but certainly not worth the expensive entrance fee.",
          "It was interesting to see the amount of fishes in the World\u2019s biggest Aquarium tunnel. My 2 year old son enjoyed it so much.",
          "We had great time with kids at the aquarium. It also houses a 3D cinema and a snow room. However, it is a bit expensive for foeigners.",
          "Rather expensive, but had to kill time before catching a flight in the evening. Annoyed I had to so much, however, pleasantly surprised on what was on offer. You could do the all attractions within 30 minutes to an hour. However, we stayed longer and had drinks in the cafe. I",
          "The aquarium is really great prepared, the arrangements of the polls are stunning - sank cars, airplane, some ancient figures, with sharks swimming around, it's a great experience to see it. The pool with rays is a key-point for kids, they look out of the water, kids can stroke",
          "Our son (3 1/2 years old) liked the aquarium, it was a nice experience, something interesting to do outside the resort. Definitely recommend \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Me and my family went today and decided not to proceed with entry as we were quoted nearly a 1000 something lira for 4 people!!!!as we were not from turkey and was originally asked for dollars which we didn\u2019t have! We\u2019re from the UK and have never ever seen this happen this is",
          "It is quite good but the price led me to expect much more..espacially when it comes to snow world ig has nothing and very very small..only 2 slides and most of the wh\u00e8els we sit inside were damaged..it is better to keep naming it ice museum rather than a snow world",
          "Very clean aquarium, great for all ages. Plenty of space to walk and take stroller. Lots of different tunnels and passages. Very clean and well maintained. The fish here are very well looked after. Lovely experience. Gift shop tad bit expensive but always the case with these",
          "Expensive, about 60$ per adult , this is not economic choice for family, it is nice place but it doesn\u2019t worth to pay 60$, very close to MM MIGROS Mall .",
          "Highly recommended for children\u2019s. A wide selection of fish. Avoid buying tickets from travel agencies as it will cost you more",

          "It was supposed to be an exceptional and \u201eone of the largest aquarium in the world\u201d. Indeed, it is just average and not so big. The aquariums are rather small, except the last one, the number of fishes is limited and with nothing exceptional. Not bad, but aquariums of Wroclaw in",
          "Highly recommend if you visit Antalya with your child\u2019s , they will enjoy it . Especially the long tunnel",
          "Very nice aquarium. Many fish and very well maintained aquarium. It has a very large tunnel to walk through. Lots to do and see. Expensive $50 per person. Children under 3 are free. Not worth the entry fee. There are other sections connected to the aquarium but these cost",
          "We had fun and it was interesting but very dark and not very big. The tunnel might be long but not with big fish like big sharks. All in all it was ok since our hotel was very close but wouldn't come from far. I love sealife so I have visited many aquariums, Vancouver,",
          "It is really amazing aquarium. I have been in Dubai and San Diego aquariums, but found Antalya Aquarium bigger and more attractive. We enjoyed the Aquarium and then the Snow White world. The tickets prices are bit overrated, and I think they have to make it more reasonable. For",

          "very big and interesting attraction with huge quantity of aquariums. its presented like a parts from different sides of Earth",
          "We enjoyed our time here and seeing all the different and wonderful ocean little creatures, but it\u2019s actually really expensive. We paid almost 85 euro for aquarium visit and Cinema for two people. About cinema - we recommend it. It was beautiful and exiting.",
          "Worst double priced ever in my life! Turkey just doesn\u2019t belong to Europe where this is illegal! 45 USD for not Turkish and 20 USD for Turkish! Don\u2019t let be yourself to be fooled!",
          "Tour guides state an hour to 1 1/2 should be laid aside, I would suggest 3 to 4 especially if your youngster love reading about all the species etc. A well laid out attraction with something to keep everyone happy. There are additional charges for the snow and wilderness venues.",
          "Everything is new and pristine but nothing spectacular. There is a shark feeding attraction but we missed it due to language barrier and lack of information so be sure to check this before you go. Access for buggies is excellent and toilets are clean. The aquarium itself is",
          "We went there from Kalei\u00e7i by bike! We enjoyed all the different activities there although it was a bit expensive. The aquarium was amazing with lots of different species of sea creatures from different parts of the world. It was very informative. The tunnel is also very nice.",
          "Booked our visit though our tour agent after the day we arrived. Lots to see but was restricted through time we had for the visit as we only had 2 hrs to get round and then we had to get back on the tour bus",
          "One of the biggest aquariums we have ever been to. A lot of species inside and also a lot of coffees and restaurants",
          "trying to spend a great time in it but once we arrived there the two hostesses sitting at the desk were not at all into costumer service and talking to us while seated and no one cares . Now the problem is if you are turkish you pay a price but if you are a tourist Baaam you",
          "its ok for an afternoon out but not as good as some of the UK ones.....it does have a mcdonalds which is a change over the all inc ...(but not as good) i would not ever go back",
          "We did a bike trip from Kalei\u00e7i to the Antalya Aquarium (8km)! It was a nice challenge that we advice for those who love biking! Anyway, once we were there, we enjoyed all the different activities there although they were generally more expensive than other tourist attractions",
          "Good afternoon out for us as a family 16yr old and 7 yr old both enjoyed the same. Great viewing tunnels on the way out.",
          "The aquarium is decent and clean but not inspiring. Did this trip because the kids are into visiting zoos. As mentioned in other reviews, accessing all the features available on-site is tricky if you are not terribly mobile. A long helical ramp (at least three loops) makes it",
          "There are 5 different activities inside this facility. First aquarium, there are aquariums seperated by geographic order and designed as where it belongs. I like that much. But dont expect amazing things. Secondly, the xd cinema, it is as good as it could be. Third, wild park.",
          "Good Moments in Antalaya Aquarium specially for kids, The main disadvantage for me, the aquarium required new types of fishes specially the BIG ones like sharks which are missed in it.",
          "We visited as part of a day trip and first thing to mention is you need to be relatively mobile to visit as there is a long spiral slope which links all the levels and its a good climb in the heat. The Aquarium itself is ok but the main attraction is the tunnel section which",
          "Antalya aquarium is not only an aquarium, beside the huge aquarium and the variety of species this place has wildlife hall ( reptiles and such) has 5D cinema and snow park. The place is well organized with lot of coffee shops and amenities",
          "We paid 190$ for two adults and 1 kid. It was full packet for wild park+ snow world +cinema + Aquarium.",
          "Was nice to go there but instead of feeding the sharks where everyone could watch its done in front of a tiny window where only a few people can watch",
          "Aquarium is very boring and definitely not the longest one for kids its good but not for teens . There are only small fishes not big ones and very expensive",
          "Very interesting, nice with magnific fish, with o long tunel. Very nice design. Exotic fish \u00een a natural habitat.",
          "Nice tunnel. Otherwise very small. The shark feeding was very interesting. You get to see lots of small sharks.",
          "The Aquarium is good however for the money you pay I was not blown away. They have the biggest tunnel in the world and various species of Sharks. However the kids were only mildly entertained. They do have a McDonalds on site so they had a good lunch afterwards. If you have a",
          "If you are in Antalya with kids this place is a must go . One can easily pass 3-4 hours over here . They have a separate reptile park and a snow world . You can buy combine tickets for all three or you can opt only for one of them . It\u2019s 4-5 kms away from the town so better take",
          "The kids were board, not well organized. Very expensive. Not much to see. If you have another choice for the kids go for it.",
          "Antalya Aquarium is one of the best aquarium in the world and the biggest Tunnel also I like almost every thing and I should put 5 stars but the price of 40$ adult and 27$ child is really too expensive",
          "To be honest, I'm not really sure why this gets so many great reviews. The aquarium is good, but certainly nothing special. As others have noted, it does have a long tunnel to walk under, but it seemed like fish stocks were low when we visited. All that said, it is probably",
          "Went here a few year's ago and so happy to come back. The place is amazing and wish we had time to do the cinema. We did the aquarium and snow world and couldn't recommend more. I wish we had the same in England. The place is amazing!",
          "The place is clean and modern but the admission is very expensive Should check it out if you looking for something to do for a few hours",
          "We visited the aquarium in June 2018 and it was exciting. Little bit expensive but awesome place to be visited. You can spend hours walking in the aquarium and it will not be boring. The most fascinating view is the entire plane inside in the aquarium.",
          "A lovely place to watch the sea world and very nicely maintained.We liked the long glass tunnel and so many varieties of fish in sea world.We also visited the Raptile World beside it and it has also many amazing reptiles species inside it.One can buy tickets for both or",
          "As per the price of the aquarium and being apparently the worlds longest tunnel, at a slow pace with photos and stops it'll take Less than 10 minutes to complete. Too expensive for what it is. No large sharks, complete waste of time. Esp when they say shark feeding, which is",
          "Biggest aquarium I\u2019ve ever been to. Excellent variety of sea creatures to view and also gets you really up close to the fish. Tunnel part of the aquarium is also very impressive. A little on the pricey side but to be expected given its size.",
          "We visited aquarium before but this one top them all.Amazing fishes and underwater life.if we come again will revisit that's sure.",
          "If you have never been to Aquarium or if your kids are fond of fishes, then yes you can visit this place. Although I don't really get a feel of visiting the biggest tunnel aquarium in the world. It is just like any other aquarium. They promote a lot of Sharks but they were",
          "we went to aquarium on the jet 2 trip from hotel and I would go by service bus and taxi next time the aquarium is very good but the trip we went on from hotel left a lot to be desired 7 hour for 1.1/2 hour in aquarium due to what else they include a trip to a jewelry factory,",
          "The Aquarium is very big and clean, the fish tanks are well decorated and they have plenty of fishes in different sizes and shapes. I recommend to visit the Aquarium.",
          "Was a nice excursion to do whilst in Antalya as it wasnt too far from hotel. Wasnt too pleased with the price, $39 just to go into the aquarium and if you wanted the full package its $80 or so. Bit extreme for my liking. The aquarium itself was nice, the tunnel was huge and can",
          "It is $35USD which works out to be more expensive that the one in London! We wanted to visit but after checking this it was a complete turnoff",
          "Fun for the kids but nothing us adults have not seen before, beware of the music in the gift shop, appauling and id have strung them all up if they worked in my shop, really not the place for ganster rap talking about their b****s motherf*****s Sucking **** the list goes on",
          "Visited on a rainy day. It was so crowded, my kid just didn\u2019t want to leave the stroller to look at the fish. No air, lot\u2019s of different smells. Paid 85\u20ac for 2 adult and a 4 year old. To much for the experience.",
          "I\u00b4ts not worth it for 35$ for adults and 27$ for children. You can get around for 15 minutes and is a little to see.",
          "Small fish are beautiful and have a lot of variety. The area around the aquarium is also very beautiful. Aquarium Tunnel is Tabular . Big fish there is not much",
          "We visited the Aquarium as part of a Thomas Cook tour, the sea life is excellent. The place is very well kept, the tanks look clean and have lots of sunken features like a car, an aircraft etc. You really only need a couple of hours to visit but it\u2019s definitely worth it to see",
          "Very helpful and ontime and NEVER goes wrong very cheap tickets and hotels so I will recommend anyone with this company",
          "I enjoyed the rest of the aquarium more then the tunnel they brag about. The tunnel aquarium feels under populated, the water is shallow and you will not have that deep underwater experience. After leaving Antalya Aquarium I felt the bitter taste of overpaying that lasted for",
          "Overall the aquarium is cool and all. There is this tunnel that is smth special, you can also see other stuff, like snakes, bugs ect, but you nees extra ticket. What I do not like is that it feels like a tourist trap, it is expensive. Your choice if you go or not",
          "It ist NOT the biggestTunnel Aquarium in the world... at first very expensive for 20 minutes walk to see everything.. we are disapointed. Not much Fisch around. Ive seen a better one already.",
          "Beautiful aquarium and great day out. We traveled from side to the aquarium which was quite far. The tanks full of lovely unusual fish. Loved the tunnel walkway. Would be good if there where better deals for if you want to see the reptiles as well.",
          "These place was very beautiful and included many activity aquarium ice city ski and restaurants and cafe and the location was perfect",
          "I bought tickets for the aquarium + snow world, reptile house and XD cinema online and that was a mistake. As we showed our confirmation and yet they wanted more money. It was very expensive and though the place was very nice, the straff were just incompetent and hung up the",
          "It was possible to choose a 'package'. We took the aquarium & reptile part. It was nice to walk around and see, I don't regret it but I won't visit it for a second time",
          "Aquarium itself had so much potential as the lay out and variety of tanks were great however there just wasn\u2019t enough variety of exciting fish! Couple of sharks and few other average fish that was it, went round it in about 15 minutes. Shame really 3D cinema was terrible,",
          "Excellently maintained,a bit out of the way to reach if you are travelling via taxi or private transport.At ticket counter they quoted me price in US $.Whereas the price of the ticket was not displayed at anywhere.Also price of the ticket is not mentioned on the ticket.",
          "It's okay to walk around for an hour but you have to pay separately for reptiles cinema and snow world we did 3 of them and I wouldn't pay the prices they charge if it was alltogther then maybe I was quite disappointed for what it was",
          "Nice tunnel aquarium, but the totally crazy price tell me to say ...save the money and it's only fish. 135 TL...what a shame",
          "Great mix of small and big tanks in the aquarium. They have brilliant themes tanks and the tunnel one will give you an up close view that is amazing. We didn\u2019t pay for any of the extras so only went into the aquarium. It is easy to find and there is a McDonald\u2019s at the exit to",
          "Specially aquariums. As a diver... but this is probably the biggest aquarium i have ever seen in my life... its great for children ... and families",
          "Lovely place to visit, much larger than I expected and the aquarium's tunnels were amazing. There was also a reptile world and indoor snow place there that looked nice, especially for kids, but we didn't visit.",
          "Entrance to the aquarium was insanely expensive at 301.50 Turkish Lira (for two people) for the aquarium alone. There were various other packages available that included a snow pack, cinema etc.. but we just wanted to visit the aquarium. The price was not worth it in the",
          "This was a good place for the family to visit when the weather was dark and cloudy. There could be better interactions with the fish pool's with the kids but the aquarium had good species of exotic fishes. You can get good discounts on line or if you have a tourist voucher.",
          "Very nice place to visit and see natures beauty. Only a short drive from Lara Beach and you can take in other sites ie. The Old City and Caves aswell.",
          "The entrance fee is very expensive and there is nothing interesting to see if you have been to aquariums before you don\u2019t need to spend money on this one. Tunnel is big but the was no fish in it:(",
          "We had a lovely day out at the Aquarium well worth a visit a good selection of sea life to see the tunnels are fantastic you feel as though you can actually touch the fish we had a snack in the snack bar which was a reasonable price & enjoyable. It is well worth a visit & would",
          "It is like you are in the sea and you among the different fishes etc. Also a good activity for children",
          "The visit started disappointing because of the small tanks at the beginning but it soon changed when we got to the main attraction. We thoroughly enjoyed it. I have been to a couple of aquariums before and this so far is the best. Unless you are a massive fan of creepy crawlies,",
          "Because I visited off season on Saturday around 14:00 it was like I had the Antalya Aquarium practically to myself. No crowds and few kids. If you have kids though it is fantastic and there is shark feeding at 12:00 each day. The display tanks featured ancient themes mostly but",
          "It was a very beautiful tour today. It was a bit expensive, but we enjoyed the day very much. The under water tunnel was amazing. We saw also the Wild Park, which was very nice. I can only give my best thumps up for this experience.",
          "ticket was 35$ and was good.not very good.near aktur park.had bus station near.easy to find.there was some problem with near street.they were rebuilding the streets.",
          "I Have to say this was disappointing I\u2019ve been to better eating there is only Mac Donald\u2019s and for those whom can\u2019t eat that well you stuffed and the place it\u2019s self it was ment to be the biggest in Europe and was ment to have sharks we didn\u2019t see any so I wasn\u2019t impressed",
          "Very nice, modern and large aquarium. Many species of fish. Nice and imaginative expositions. Barrier-free access. watch out for sharks!! :).",
          "I think it is too expensive. We have been there with free coupons so it was a good experience. There are so little sharks, which are too far worth to see by this ticket pay. The tunnel has ads. that is the longest in the world\ud83e\udd14 i dont think so. The concepts are not bad, worth",
          "It\u2019s clean, but very expensive for what it has to offer. The tour takes approximately about 1 hour. It didn\u2019t excite me as much.",
          "Visited with my 5 year old who enjoyed seeing the different sharks. The visit can be done in about 1- 1.5 hours there is a McDonald and coffee shops on site",
          "This place ia amazing the tunnels are endless with all variety of beautiful fishes and the wildlife section is out of the world must visit.",
          "We came here because it was raining and we wanted to do something indoors. We paid about \u00a330 per person for the aquarium and wildlife package. The whole experience was very standard - nothing ground-breaking. It wasnt worth what we paid. The animals weren't very interesting and",
          "Excellent place to go with all ages and lots to see. Excellent views to see. Good prices for eating too.",
          "i had paid 20 lira and when my friends had asked how much the price had gone up to 60 lira all of a sudden. i stepped forward and asked them in turkish why the price was higher and they said because they didnt have a turkish citizenship card and i made it clear to them that",
          "I loved this, and so did my very young child, who was enraptured by it. Highly recommend as something to do in the Antalya area - a good rainy day option.",
          "Very interesting experience. Perfect staf. several souvenir shops. We spent there about 1-1,5 hour. 1 disadvantage- price is rather big. 35 USD per person. In any cas e sugest to visit.",
          "You know you read all the negative reviews and you still want to find out yourself.. Well, nearly.. When your young child insists and you don't want to break her heart, you go.. Ashamed.. Why? The different entry fees between tourists and Turks. I am Turkish, and still I think",
          "Is nice but I\u2019ve visit other more interesting and chipper. If you want to see reptiles or others animals like pinguins you have to pay extra. So I paid 30 euro just for fish and shares...",
          "It was a rainy day so we looked for indoor activities. Visiting the Aquarium and then 5M Migros mall was a good idea, but an expensive one. Indeed the aquarium is great, and consists of four sections, the aquarium, the wild life, the snow part and the cinema. To visit all, it",
          "Antalya is off season yet, people going to the Aquarium. If you have time now to can spend few hours there. They have variously fishes. Especially the tunnel is great.",
          "Well worth a visit, despite being a little expensive. They have a huge collection of fish, beautifully and sensitively displayed. Apparently it has the world's longest tunnel aquarium.",
          "Upon entry, photographers will snap your picture and incorporate it on different types of merchandise like plates and magnets that you can collect for a fee at the exit. Fish tanks are well maintained and displayed, also a lot of information to read. They have the biggest tunnel",
          "Cost for 5 adults and 2 under 5 was $400 plus the \u20ac110 Euro for taxis. Aquarium was good the tunnel was also very good. Nice to sit and watch the rays go over you. The 4d cinema was out of sync and not worth a wasted 8 mins. The wild life part on top was empty the reptiles",
          "Good place to visit , lots to see. Easy accessible from old town by bus or taxi. Nice coffee shop on way out.",
          "Amazing samples of fishes, different sea and ocean spices. Very easy to rich from city center and old city Kaleici by bus or private transport. Beautifully planned, Tunnels, samples of cars and planes from war times that drawn during the war, so scary a bit as well. Rather",
          "I did not go into the aquarium because when we were ready to pay they only charge in US dollars. Which I found so silly seen as we are in Turkey which requires Turkish Lira. It is better to go if you have children and you have the choice of just the aquarium or you can add the",
          "We paid 150 US$ just for the entrance (2 adults +2 children, 9 and 3 years old). Nothing overly exciting , Dubai aquarium I think is more interesting. Real price should be no more than 10$",
          "Amazing and especially for the kids they have loved it . Our trip was short but we might go back in the summer",
          "Took the kids on a day out although local we have never had the chance to go. We really enjoyed it and would reccommend to all.",
          "We visited late in the season but can honestly say its nothing special, over priced for what it is.... it didnt take long to get round the whole thing! It took longer to walk up the ramp to it! The tunnel is cool but once youve seen that youve pretty much seen it all. We also",
          "There a lot of things to see. The biggest aquarium tunnel in the world. The fish are amazing, space enough for a lit of people. Everyone who visit Antalya should visit this aquarium. I'm surprised eitj the variety of living things. Will visit again sure.",
          "Lovely trip my children loved seeing the fish lovely and clean. My children loved spending there holiday money in the gift shop would defiantly come back and visit as didn\u2019t have enough time to visit reptiles",
          "The entrance fee and gift shops were over priced but it was a fun day out. My 5 year old loves fishes and the shark feeding was very good. The staff were friendly and helpful, always smiling :-)",
          "Nice aquarium very clean and quite a lot to see but only takes about 40 mins to walk around. Impressive water tunnel with sting rays and sharks. Coffee shops and souvenir inside the aquarium. Also Mcdonalds just outside.",
          "Lovely aquarium with the longest glass tunnels in the world. Children will love it. Much to do when there.",
          "Very good and nice place to know about seas and ocean. Fish are great and there are a lot of them. Cool place to shop for sophineares.",
          "After paying over a \u00a3100 for me and my family of 4 to enter half of the experience was walking around shops where there trying to get more money from you I thought we were going to see dolphins or large sharks instead 80% was looking at no more than gold fish in tanks walk",
          "The aquarium has a lot of amazing fish and reptiles to see but it is so sad to see them stuffed in small aquariums with artificial plants and corals. Furthermore, there's nothing special about the place and its overpriced. I only gave 3 stars because most of the kids seemed to",
          "fantastic place a must see if visiting antalya ...great for all the family time flys by in here wonderful to see .....",
          "Kids had a wonderful time. Make sure you can spend 2.5 - 3 hours. Lots of things to see. Do not forget to take shoes, not sandals for kids, as there is a snow room with snow slopes.",
          "What a disappointment. \u00a350 for 2 adults for less than an hour of entertainment. Some of the fish were crammed into very small tanks, yet the \"longest underwater tunnel in the world\" had hardly anything in it. If you want to see goldfish, koi carp and lots of other fish you get",
          "the best way to introduce the real ocean life to your children is to visit this place with them. Fish of all kinds from home aquarium to sharks, turtles and divers )) Not recommend to visid 5D cinema for children under 5",
          "This place is extremely deceptive. Everything is charged In American dollars. $265 Turkish lira to enter into rubbish bin! The worker was very rude, checking to see if our daughter was over 3! When explain she was 2, and he kept checking! This is basically a room with 30 fish",
          "i loved this place i think its one of the biggest in the world it has many sea creatures. many different fishes colorful and nice! the atmosphere is very relaxing because of the background music with the view is really good for relaxation however its a bit pricy for a family its",
          "If you're in Antalya make sure you don't miss the Aquarium. Our 2 children (aged 4 and 6) were really impressed of our visit there. Don't miss Snow World and the candy on the top is the 4D movie at their cinema. 5 stars from us\ud83d\udc95",
          "Nice place, a bit expensive!! The brochure said 200 sharks I found 25 but overall nice place again too expensive for the experience",
          "The aquarium is large so give yourself enough time . The presentation is excellent and the tunnel is magnificent.The and information provided is detailed for the large selection of fish represented. The snow section was fun especially coming form the hot weather outside . We",
          "This Aquarium is really pretty! You are not going to see the rarest spices but you will see enough! It can be especially interesting for a kids cause there are many games and adventures to do! There is a beautiful souvenir shop after you leave aquarium and also place to eat!",
          "Fascinating fish types, probably the majority of world fish species exist in one of the multiple aquarium tanks. Aquarium tunnel is large and amazing to walk through.",
          "Had a good morning out at Aquarium, it has the largest walk through overhead aquarium with plenty of different species of fish would recommend for families.",
          "New aquarium, not to far from Migros 5 ( shopping mall) do remember that if you go by bus you get of at Migros & walk to the main road & then continue around the mall to get to the entrance of the aquarium ( a good 10 minutes walk) Aquarium itself is neatly build: for once",
          "I went there with my family the aquarium doesn't offer so much to sea and has few kind of fish they charge 35$ per person which is too high and this place doesn't worth paying this amount for it where a person pays such amount for just half an hour because its too small and",
          "I think not expensive, we saw four different area (aquarium-snowland-cinema-wild park) all of them was perfect just wild park need more lights. Snowland and cinema good idea for kids. Everybody should saw here. Have a nice trip guys!!",
          "We was in december,we stay in Lara kundu but we take 2 bus because is far. Aquarium is big you must to stay one day to visit all but is very nice. The price was not cheap .",
          "The title says it all really. The aquarium is part of a complex featuring a 'snow world' play area and 'wildlife' centre but this review is purely based on the aquarium as we didn't visit the other areas. A whopping \u00a353 for 2 adults to get in, glad I don't have kids! That's",

          "I visited with my sister . I must say it is expensive . But it is very nice . I was very impressed..!",
          "Good to see but i really don't recommand to pay for that. The price was extremely expensive with the boat, you can do it by earth",
          "We visited the aquarium during our vacation in Antalya. It' very entertaining especially if you have children. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "Visited the Aquarium whilst on holiday at Lara Beach and what an amazing place it is. Definitely worth a visit and will not disappoint.",
          "A different kind of fish, nice style with a many visitor which delay our time because the long line. its a nice sea life with a nice wonderful feeling. I enjoyed God creative which made me thinking a lot about the life in the deep of Ocean and seas.",
          "Its so beautiful and interesting and romantic and quite place for relaxing and engoy of water view and fish....more of fish...but cost of entrance too expensive..they have ice room for skating and play ...",
          "The aquarium itself is spectacular and, with careful timing, you can get to see shark feeding. However, don't miss the chance to have an up close and personal experience with a sea lion or a snake and visit the reptile house. To finish the trip you should sample real Turkish",
          "The Antalya Aquarium and the other attractions connected to it were a welcome change from Istanbul.. The place was open till late which was a plus point for us.. The food and water at the cafes were extremely overpriced though. The aquarium offered the longest tunnel in the",
          "We enjoyed it there. Lots of sealife to see. The tunnel is very long. We took some nice pics there. They take a pic of you when your going in, then you can buy at a reasonable price at the end. Not a bad afternoon out theres a mcdonalds there too. You can get a taxi right",
          "we went there in the morning and it wasnt as good as i hoped its more for kids than adults .... if ur a family with kids go if not stay away its expansive and for no point ... didnt enjoy it ..",

          "\u0130t says it is the biggest aquar\u0131um tunnel in the world huh? No way!!Above all sharks are extremely small.There are interesting wrecks and type of fishes from all around the world.Staff is helpful enough, prices are a bir pricy but not that much.I would say you can visit it once",
          "This is a nice place to visit but very expensive. there is a tunnel with larger fish. we got there before 12 clock to see the sharks being fed an it was so packed we actually missed it. when purchasing your tickets do not purchase the 4d Cinema its not worth it, its 8 mins long",
          "Not much variety in the tunnel, mainly big fish and stingrays with a few small sharks! The poor sea lions pool was also filthy and sparse...not recommended",
          "This is a good place to visit especially with children. I paid 72 euros for entry for 2 adults 2 children. The price was discounted as I had reserved tickets online. There is Mcdonalds right outside the aquarium.",
          "Nice place to visit with family and kids to discover and learn about marine as well as adults we spent nice time in. And don't miss the snow world.",
          "It's nice but for someone who travelled the world 50 dollars per person for entry is definitely overpriced ... and you can finish the while thing in 15 minutes .. so definitely overpriced",
          "\u00a350 for two people spent 30minutes inside. I wish I had listened to the bad reviews. not worth the time or money",
          "It was a wonderful trip to the tunnel aquarium,one of the biggest tunnel aquariums in the world,with a variety of fish,sharks,water snakes,crabs etc.Ticket price for the aquarium was 45 euro per person.There were many guests from different countries.At the end of the visit,there",
          "It's the world biggest tunnel aquarium i highly recommend everyone to visit it specially around noon it's when they feed the Sharks the tours takes around 2 hours",
          "Good opportunity to see a lot of marine creatures. Longest water tunel with astonishing view of the aquarium.",
          "We enjoyed going through he aquarium. Very clean, well kept and has a good collection of sea creatures to enjoy and photograph. We only bought the aquarium entry tickets ($35 Adults, $27 for children 12 and younger) because other packages with snow room or reptile room or",
          "Quite expensive but worth to visit once in the life. Aquarium built on the huge area where main tank accomodating various species of big and small fishes. Section with small fishes offering great view for the kids. Underwater tunnel is also nice. Deffinetly go there if you like",

          "Really good place, where you have lot of interesting to observe. This place is good for kids and their parents as well. Lot of fishes, snakes, spiders, sharks and so on. Kids are really happy. We've take tickets all in, and I guess it's best choice! Also watching, you can make",
          "Nothing much to say but \u00a3120 for a aquarium that we were in for 1hr and 20 mins and we were not rushing ! Also only foreigners get charged this ..save your money really not worth the cost",
          "We enjoyed . It's exciting for children but not a teenager, with a lot of different fish and sharks. The place is worth the money if you took the full package.",
          "We did the Full package which gave us access to aquarium, snow world, Ocean ride XD and wild park reptile house... Aquarium has some really nice tanks with great props in them including a plane, mini, part of a shipwreck and submarine... snow world was fun especially as it was",
          "Beautiful place and deserve to add it in your trip plan to antalya. I really enjoyed there. you will see all fishes collected from everywhere in the world.",
          "It is called \"the longest tunnel in the world\". In fact it may be and is beautiful. Interesting choice of fish and reptiles. But very expensive. All options is a cost of 70 USD per person so to see all attractions with a family 2+2 is almost 300 USD. Aquarium is a 20-30 minutes",
          "Compared to other aquariums it is incredible expensive. \"World longest under water tunnel\" must be a joke, as the one in Copenhagen seems much longer. Uninterested staff that spoke poorly English, and did not correct visitors who obviously mistreated the fish and animals by",
          "It is a very good place to visit with the family or friends . I reccomend you to go by personal car without a guide becouse its expensive. Entrance fee is 35$ per person but its ok . U need to take turkish lira becouse u can win some. Extra $ . 1$= 3.54 lira , 1\u20ac= 4.2 lira so u",
          "It's was very nice, we all had a good time, however the collection was not really big. Overall if you are traveling with kids, you should not miss the place.",
          "A beautifull tour that will never forget. The tanks decoration and how they are made is astonishing. Everything is clean and tidy. A calm sensual music is played live on violin. The tunel is WOW you will be surrounded by a huge tank filled with sharks and you are chaneling in",
          "Good few hours , kids loves it, however it is tooooo A good place to visit but expensive... ... $32/person for only acquarium tour ...full tour $70 !!!! times 4 persons ... very expensive... the tank tunnel is good, but nothing out of the ordinary with respect to fish variation.",
          "They took 151 usd for about an an hour It is the minimum cost you have to pay more if you choose an extra activit\u00e9s like swimming with sharks It is good but prices should be less",

          "We visited this huge aquarium and saw so many amazing fish, and the place was very clean. The tunnel with fish surrounding was also exciting and incredible, definitely a must see place!",
          "Although it is very expensive, the children enjoyed it very much. It was very quiet so maybe special offers to all not just locals would probably bring more visitors. \u00c7ok pahali olmasina ra\u011fmen, \u00e7ocuklar \u00e7ok sevdi. Gayet sesizdi, belki kampanyalar yapilsa herkes i\u00e7in daha \u00e7ok",
          "Nice place. Children have a possibility to feed fishes. Maybe snow room is too little. 5D cinema is weak of its effects.",
          "An nice aquarium but not one of the most impressive I've ever seen(for ex,Valencia or Genova).But it's not one of the cheapest,that's for sure!They have one of the the highest entry fees,35$/adult and 27$/children 3-12 years.Not very big,though they say they have the longest",
          "Can't be compared to Dubai Mall Aquarium, you need 30 to 45 mn to finish it, extremely expensive (500+ Lira just for the aquarium visit for 2 adults and 3 children), limited species, small sharks.",
          "The aquarium visit was a nice one. Plenty fish species. Very big spaces so you will not feel crowded. Very clean and i was happy to find also clean toilets inside. Like most turkish sights, plenty opportunities to spend money inside on snacks or souveniers.",
          "A place worth watching with kids and enjoy the delphin and other sea creatures.make it an early morning trip to save from lots of visitors",
          "We booked thru TUI and this was part of a shopping day tour in Antalya It was good but not overly great. Ideal for kids. They have reptile world, snow world and 4DX film too. It had the world's longest aqua tunnel Our trip only included entry to aquarium but we paid 40 lira",
          "Great place but very expensive with the usual hard push to get photos taken. Kids loved it though and good experience",
          "Well it is an interesting place for children, the tunnel is long and interesting. They took 447 TL for 2 adults and 2 children just for the aquarium visit. The lady who works at the ticket office was not helpful she doesn't answer questions like how much it will take to visit",
          "Was a place where me and my family was feeling good.We like fishes and this was a relaxing day.Also was good on 43 degrees to play with the snow.",
          "It was a nice experience for the kids who were 3 to 6 years. They say its the biggest underwater tunnel in the world but i doubt. The sharks they have are small and my kids wanted 2 c a big shark but nevertheless they had so much fun.",

          "We visited the aquarium after booking with Thomas Cook tours at the hotel. We took a private tour because we were 3 families and wanted the bus for ourselves. The aquarium was alright. The range of sea life they have is good but I've honestly seen a wider range in kuwait",
          "We went there during our trip to antalya it was very nice but way overpriced 35$ for one adult and about a 100$ for two adult with a 4 year old All in all it was a nice visit ...",
          "it was nice experience. a lot of WOW points, some sort of fish u have never heard before. it is gonna be a good fun for kids as well. If you go at noon, they have shark feeding ceremony. call before and get more info",

          "Me and my boyfriend are a young couple and we had a great day at the Antalya Aquarium! We found it reasonably priced at 160 lira for both of us for four attractions, reptile world, snow world, aquarium, submarine ride. (Not the exact names but close enough) The aquarium tunnel",
          "How can they possibly justify 129Tl per person for just the aquarium. The other 'attractions' are extra and....the reptile house, the dolphinarium and the snowland........all similarly priced. Makes or a VERY expensive day out. Needless to say we went no further than the ticket",
          "The aquarium was rather overpriced! Reasonably good collection. Must attend the FEEDING OF FISH (around 1300 hrs). A man descends into water and start feeding the fish. All kinds of fish surround him. Separate ticket for the cinema at the top level (not worth it). Good Italian",
          "Nice place to visit in Antalya city and great chance to see so many exotic animals. Also it is a great acvity for kids but a bit expensive. If you are looking for an indoor activity for kids, go for it!",

          "The highlight of this aquarium is the biggest aquarium tunnel in the world. It feels like the people are on display with the fish watching us. It appears that they are able to swim throughout the tunnel, around and above the visitors. There are many other fascinating windows",
          "If u like fish and sea creatures that s just for you. I strongly recommend that you should visit it at the time of sharks lunch, which is nearly 12.30 pm. The diver is great and makes a show while feeding them.",

          "This is relatively expensive at c. \u00a335 each. But just about worth it as undoubtedly this new aquarium has been built to impress, particularly the underwater tunnel - the largest in the world and you won't forget it in a hurry due to its various staged pieces/diaroma's.",

          "From the moment you arrive you are mesmerised by the variety of sea life on show. The tanks are well thought out from sunken cars to aircraft and back to ancient ruins. Plus you get to stroll through a really long glass tunnel whilst fish swim around you and above you. Brilliant",
          "Fantastic day here with the kids, lots of fish and you can see the Sharks close up. The tunnel was great, the divers were cleaning the tanks and blew kisses at my daughters, which they loved! Really well looked after place. We also went to the snow zone afterwards which was",
          "This aquarium is outstanding - there are numerous individual tanks before you get to the tunnel, which goes around a very large tank containing sharks and more. We saw the sharks being fed, which the kids loved. We also went to the reptile habitat, which was pretty good as well,",

          "35$ for an Ok aquarium ! what a rip off !The tunnel was good, otherwise less than mediocre. I don\u2019t recommend it.",
          "It worth visiting the Aquarium. The best place to spend the day with family. You have lot of choices of attractions. The prices are little bit expensive",
          "Verry interesting for kids. I will not say that it is the \"longest underwater tunnel\" as it is not so long :) in my opinion. Nice to visit when you don't have anything else to do, without kids.",
          "Nice and plesent place. Good for small children. My both children enjoyed the beautiful fishes and tunnel specially. Pretty pricey for turkey though.",
          "It is a nice place bu it doesn\u2019t worth the price. If you have allready visit Izmir aquarium (that is amazing) it is waste of money. I think that is cheaper to get inside a plane travel to Izmir, see the aquarium (with a ticket 5 times \u2026",
          "Awesome! Great variety of fishes, snakes. The snowroom also very interesting! Great place for kids!",
          "Not as big and spectacular as expected, but worth checking out with kids",
          "Entrance and food expensive. Very good thematic displays. Lacks larger species. Nice is that you can tailor your visit according to your budget. We took the full package. Very glad we went",
          "It\u2019s worth visiting and kids will like it. \n\nHowever, this place needs a better Mangment and it\u2019s  absolutely  Not a WOW.\n\nSame exotic fish everywhere and it\u2019s above all good to visit.",
          "Pretty nice aquarium. They have many different fish swimmimg around in their themed aquariums. The long tunnel is beautiful but doesn't have that many different species swimming around in it. The ticket price is also a bit on the high side in comparison to what you get. But it's still worth visiting.",
          "Great place to visit. You feel you entered a different world. \nDefinitely worth the price as keeping such huge aquarium require a lot of effort",
          "Well-decorated tanks and a long underwater tunnel. Lots of rays and small sharks. Expensive, and they try to upsell extras.",
          "Very expensive and not worth the price.. the whole thing is pretty small compared to other aquariums, but it costs 70 USD for a full package. The only interesting thing is the possibility to bottle feed the koi fish and petting the sting rays. The whole experience is worth a third of the price, tops, in my experience.",
          "Too expensive for what u get to see, the tunnel is okay but not so many fish around. I was disappointed.",
          "Ababsolutely disappointing...you can see just few fishes and 1 shark..nu turtles or other magnific animals..the only really nice thing is that for 10 Turkish lira you can feed the koy fish...its really not worth it the money.",
          "Nice vibe and sea creatures collections. There are many interesting things in this place, like the required information and atmosphere for the specific location to attract sea species. Also there is snow park near by for kids. In the way out you will find 3D Cinemana.",
          "It was one of the best places we visited in Antalya. We had a lot of fun and some good pictures as well.",
          "Its quite expensive thou....for non turkish people.... but worth to See... the highlight is def the Tunnel....the rest is okey...",
          "A good 3 hr toor in the largest tunnel aquarium in the world. A must visit place in antalya. U need to check the ice village",
          "Make sure you book the full package and start your trip early so you can watch the sharks feeding part and also so you can utilize the rest of your day in another location or activity.\n\nTickets are around 60 usd for adults and 50 for kids \u2026",
          "Costly. They have two prices. One for locals and another for foreigners. A family of three would cost $105. Why? Better check other average reviews before u pay.",
          "It's quite nice, but not very big - 2 floors.",
          "We compare it with Hurghada's aquarium (in Egypt). Expected more species. But it was not bad and we like this aquarium too. Terrible were prices of souvenirs.",
          "I liked the place. It's a beautiful huge aquarium with lots of different fishes. \nThe opening hours are quiet long and one can reach there as well by bus or simple take a cap (from markantalya arround 22TL). \nThe entrance fee where oka. \u2026",
          "It's really nice Aquarium the biggest in the world u should visit it like i do with @GavinMagnus",
          "It's expensive and the experience is not worth the money. The wildlife and reptile park is a waste of time and money. I was disappointed. The place is overrated and is not as big as advertised for. I did it, but if you've been to aquariums \u2026",
          "The aquarium is surprisingly good. I don't know why, but I expected worse. Though there is no huge variety of big fish species, aquarium tunnel is amazing and compensates it.",
          "I loved it, it's amazing,  sharming,  you can see all kinds of marines creatures & educational programmes & studies about sea  , there is times for sharks feeding & a plane in it's normal size sinking in one of aquariums, &a ship.  The most \u2026",
          "There were not as many species of aquatic life that I was hoping for however  it was a pleasant walk round and very clean with attractive interesting displays in the tanks.",
          "If you are a tourist, it doesn't worth it. Save your money and do something else. It's nice but overpriced. Locals pay the same amount, but different currency, meaning you pay 5 times more.",
          "Nice place we v been only to the aquarium as each place (aquarium,tropical,ice world charge separatly) for non turkish people we paid about 100$ for two adults and 4 yo under 3 is free the aquarium takes about 30 mins to walk through its nice if u havnt been to large aquariums but iv seen better for less its nice but expensive",
          "Best sea aquarium  in the world as per my perception",
          "Beautiful.  Very professional. \nAmazing tunnel aquarium. \nMy son enjoyed the aquarium and the reptile park",
          "It is very nice place, if you come to antalya don't miss equa land and snow land it funny for kids",
          "We visited this place twice. We like it so much, especially the tunnel aquarium but the entrance fee is expensive",
          "Too costly, not worth that much money... Otherwise we'll maintained, but ticket prices must be lowered.",
          "Crowded but still nice. A little bit noisy because of many people and very loud noises from speakers.",
          "Good place to visit with kids. Est. time about 3-4 hours. Very delicious ice creams ;)",
          "False advertising and over advertised. Absolute rip off with the prices, you don\u2019t get to see much fish and get a better experience. I would definitely not recommend it to anyone, there\u2019s better places to see in Antalya for way less.",
          "Not a bad aquarium overall. But there are different rates for citizens of Turkish. 69 liras for local people and 50 usd for foreigners. This is unfair against the norms of tourism.",
          "One of the best aquariums that I have seen. Great fish selection with an interesting layout of he tanks. The main attraction is, indeed, the large basin with 2 large tunnels going through. Well worth visiting!",
          "Very interesting site. Especially for children. Online tickets a little bit cheaper then buying at the ticketoffice.",
          "We were so taken by the hyoe that we felt disappointed when we finally got there. There are other ocean parks and aquariums that contain better collection of fishes. Not many ocean reef variety present. For someone who has keen interest in aquaria, this is underwhelming.",
          "Nothing special and very expensive. The wild animals outweighed the aquarium. It's not brilliant to be fair.",
          "Aquarium is ok ....but the entrance Fees \u20ac35 euros per person is expensive",
          "Interesting place. Baby sharks available here but not daddy & mummy shark.",
          "Blue light is annoying. Suvenir shop is a bit pricy. You can pay with eurou, but it round up to euro, they will not receive cents. Crowdy at photoshop. In rest is ok. Plus at snwworld and cinema. You need like 2 and a half hour to visit",
          "Overall it was nice for the kids, but somehow lacking species diversity, especially in the tunnel where sharks and rays were the only thing to see. As usual they try to squeeze more money by  making photos at entry point then selling it at the exit for like 10euro a small magnet photo.",
          "The place is nice, it has a good variety, but the entrance fees is high\nThe snow park is very small and it needs more preparation like gloves and special shoes.",
          "Online tickets process is ridiculous...you purchase them online fill forms crad information, etc... Then you have to go to the tickets office they to verify this and print the tickets! \nAlso about the aquarium it self - value for money is extremely overpriced... In Barcelona aquarium you see much more for half prices.",
          "RIP off!! No proper guidance no great white as advertised! Poor XD show over priced & boring",
          "Nice and clean. Very good!",
          "The Aquarium is nice, but I thing it is a little bit expensive. However, it is worth for one time visits.",
          "We are 2 adults and a child. At the entrance we bought our tickets and the price was written in USD only. 35 USD for an adult and 27 USD for a child. It seemed little pricey compared to other prices in Antalya.  We paid the 97 USD and \u2026",
          "Probably the largest aquarium in the world. Many fishes and other animals. Good place for families with children.",
          "For the people who are visiting Aquarium for the first time, it can be a wonderful experience. It's called as biggest aquarium in the world. Personally if i say, it was overpriced, it takes one hour to complete the full aquarium and it cost more then 35USD.",
          "Not worth the price!! Singapore , Dubai Atlantis and Sydney aquarium way better!!",
          "Visited with a low expectation bench mark being the Singapore or other museums in other parts of the globe.But to our surprise we had some more additional unexpected features like a shop of candies and gifts...had a good lot of money spent \u2026",
          "Good place for families and children to see all kinds of fish's and sharks under the water aquarium .",
          "Well, was expecting more, tbh. Not a huge variety. No sharks or any big fish. Doesn't deserve $ 35 per person. But the building is beautiful. I like it",
          "A great variety of animals, all of them appeared to be well kept, interesting expos,kids loved it.",
          "Surprised to find such a big aquarium in Turkey. No live corals or many reef fish, but great touch tanks and tunnel.",
          "Not worth to visit!! (Aquarium + snow package)\n \n1- Comparing the price vs what you expect to see\n2- comparing with others like what you see in USA, Dubai, Spain and Kuwait\n\nPlease read my below comment carefully:\n1- aquarium doesn't have \u2026",

          "Perfect for family time, but pricy",
          "We were some frustrative. The aquarium is pretty small and doesn't cost its price.",
          "Really liked it. Lots of different species of fish, clean and not hot inside. Enjoyed visiting with my kids and they also were fascinated by the views. It would have been nice if some of the windows were cleaner and more clear.",
          "Interesting place with great tunnel inside. However in some aquariums there were too many huge fishes on small capacity.",
          "Too expensive, waaay too short (you are done with the entire aquarium in about 30 minutes), the fish tanks are extremely small for the amount of fish trapped in there - animal abuse! Although the longest underwater walkway is kind of interesting even though the sharks are very small - the advertising for that is a bit misleading.",
          "Great attraction in a very nice part of Antalya. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "I think I was cheated yesterday while buying tickets to enter Aquarium. Why? Because, I paid 187,95 TL for one adult ticket (to see fishes and famous tunnel). The same price was for other adult person. I thought it is regular price for \u2026",
          "Nice place to go with kids specially. There Is a big variety of fish some of the huge or very strange.\n\nThe place have WiFi and at 12 there is feeding time for sharks that everyone wants to see and therefore it's difficult to see something. \u2026",
          "There are varieties of fish species in this beautiful aquarium. You have different species of sharks, rays and fishes from all the continents. The tunnel part of the aquarium is magnificent and the biggest in the world.",
          "It really amazes me when I see places like this getting ratings above 1 star....\n Can somehow understand that it can be like the first time for people that come from the depths of nowhere, but still this place is a really bad one. \u2026",
          "1 hour visit. If it is the only aquarium in your life it is nice but the longest tunnel was a bit disappointing. Variety is not as much as you expect but nevertheless a nice 1 to 1.5 hour trip",
          "Interesting to visit. Biggest tunnel is really amazing. The minus is that it was overcrowded, and there was a lack of fresh air.",
          "Amazing, huge aquarium. Spent hours and didn't get to see everything.",
          "Recommend the full package so kids have all in one day...snow world in antalya hot weather is an adventure \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "The price for tourists is ridiculous. I didn't enter after I saw the price.",
          "Nice place but the photograps from the entrance are thief's like everywhere, asking 25 EU for a photo and 2 small fridge photo magnet.",
          "Wonderful place that shows you multi kind of fish and see creatures, and theres the wild garden, and ice city all in one place",
          "Not worth the entry fee. We just visited the aquarium and we were done in less than an hour. For US  $35 it was excessive, especially in Turkey. Much more worthwhile places to visit in Antalya.",
          "Wonderfull, thow very crowded.... It's worth seeing, especialy for families with children.",
          "Interesting, exciting and a new perspective to see fish swim above your head.",
          "This place is a total scam. The tickets are ridiculously expensive. There are a few things to see but that will take 20 minutes, the rest is underwhelming. And that tunnel is indeed very long but mostly empty. Avoid if you like aquariums.",
          "Lovely place to visit. The Aquarium is built very nicely and informations also written about different species. Can go there by Antalya bus as well easily. In summer you can visit the Antalya Aqualand as well which is in front of the aquarium",
          "Of course they have a tunnel 131 meters long and snow room but the fish descriptors are not quite accurate, in snow room they don't ask your size and you get e. g. only jacket 2 sizes larger than you need. No prices exposed for photos and \u2026",
          "The signs are too hard too read for the little ones, and not detailed enough for the curious. They are in turkish, english and russian. For the very high price, I would have expected more content. I had so many unanswered questions. The \u2026",
          "Waste of money, kids place, totally not for adults.",
          "I loved this place. Its one of antalya's landmarks and its near konyalti beach.. the place is really big and has many sections but the access ticket is little pricy (around 33 dollars) but i had good time in general there. Its very good place for kidz",
          "Excellent aquarium and reptile displays.\nPrices are slightly steep for the overall size of the place but if definatly worth a visit if your here and like this type of thing .\nShops are really decent,very clean and tidy.\nWe really enjoyed \u2026",
          "Good set up. Easy access from the city. Several choice if restaurants and cafe inclusive a mcdonalds. Theres a small souvineer shop that has a good choice of souvineers. As the largest tunnel aquarium I had more expectation. I had expected \u2026",
          "It is good . But not as I expected. I liked the many variations of marine organisms. But a little sharks. I liked the lower water channel. There are not many crustaceans and mollusks. Prices are unbelievably overpriced. There is a few in \u2026",

          "A good place to visit with your family. Amazing place",
          "Great place. Little overpriced. Entry fee is 35$ for the aquarium. Will cost more if you want to go and experience everything else as well. Taxis were available easily from the exit and the drivers spoke English. Clearly, the area has been \u2026",

          "Cafe is charging prices in euros for tourists. Pricelist is shown only when Your are paying at cashpoint. Ask always prices beforehand, don't order anything without pricelist. The best way is not ordering at all! 2 smaal nescafe and 0.5ltr water bottle was 56 liras... I thought",

          "Attended with a tour group and the guide was superb who showed us around different beautiful spots in Antalya in one day. Tiring day but worth it.",
          "We enjoyed the experience of seeing the waterfall not the biggest but an attraction anyway. Pay attention to the steps on the way down ! We treated ourselves to traditional turkish icecream after our return to road level, made from goats milk ! Delicious.",
          "It\u2019s twenty years since we were here last and, of course , we are that much older. It\u2019s something different for younger people but I would not recommend it to the over 65\u2019s or those with health problems. Uneven and broken steps abound, rough ground and overhanging branches.",
          "Really beautiful hidden gem, however it was quite touristy. We visited in March which is classed as off peak season and yet it was full of people. Try to visit in early hours or afternoon if you want truly enjoy view and take decent pictures\ud83d\ude0a",

          "We visited via a Thomas Cook '3 waterfalls' excursion. This is really worth a visit even if not on an organised excursion.",
          "Great place to visit....waterfalls and nature are amazing had a fun day ... you can also picnic and swim and in season Camel rides are also available",
          "Stunning place, it's a must! Bit out the way but well worth the effort. It's a hot spot with the locals and their families so it says it all.",
          "It's a natural waterfall, great place to walk on the little river and inside the forest, it's not far from Antalya city center maximum 30 munites from Antalya city center. You can see lots of fish but fishing is not allowed. You can take wonderful pictures for your instagram.",
          "It is worth being distracted from visiting the ruins and to go to these waterfalls. The tranquility of the flowing water calms the nerves. However there are many steps to get there si stout walking boots are a must. Not suitable for those with a mobility challenge.",
          "This was a great attraction to visit, very cheap enttrance fee and lots of trails to try. There are so many little paths off that you can feel as if you are getting lost in the undergrowth! This was lovely to wander round in the cooling sun but there are lots of steps so wear",

          "Big park with small water fall view, can't swim... Only to visit and see water fall. 2 hours are enough for this palce",
          "Place is just the ideal place to visit and enjoy a long walk through the pathways. Mostly shaded due to trees all around and easy to find as there are marking and signs. There are some restaurants around as well as some playground for kids. Highly recommended. Entrance is 7 TL",
          "We went here to see the waterfalls. Wow what a view. We fell in love they were beautiful. You had like a bit of a national park to walk round here. We really enjoyed walking around here and seeing the woodland. Nice thing to do as a couple a nice time out away from hotel",

          "Absolutely impressed with the natural beauty of Antalya region, this park is well worth the visit. however the exit sign is very misleading, if you follow it, it will take you to walk a biiiiig circle along a few scenery spots.. but way too much for a flipflop walk...LOL",
          "This waterfall is lovely, however, it has less water now as what the tour guide mentioned. Its park is considered one of the most important ones as people come with families for gatherings and bbq there. It is a wide space to walk through. The path is very organized to the",
          "A beautiful location in a national park. There are many steps to the waterfall and the woodland pathways are not suitable for anyone with mobility problems or young children. (Some steep drops with no safety fencing.) You are not allowed to enter the pool but can walk",

          "Very pretty waterfall, was expecting more , but fine, steps steep and not a good path round, cafe near top of steps , over priced and you don\u2019t get what you see in photos on menu, we ordered a cheeseburger from a photo looked lovely juicy . What arrived was more bun and a",
          "We went here on the recommendation of our travel advisor who suggested this was more impressive than duden waterfalls which we were planning to go to instead as its closer to lara beach. These waterfalls are about 30mins from lara beach by taxi. Expect to pay about 50 euros for",
          "Very nice and refreshing place to visit with your family. Be mentally prepared to climb lots of stairs on return. Avoid carrying baby stroller as you will need to climb stairs. The place is very neat and it gives 100% peace to your mind and body",
          "The waterfall is fine, and is worth the photo opportunity. One cafe at the entrance to the stairs has a tourist only menu with the Turkish lire column empty, only euro/$. Five Euro/dollars for a lemonade. I don't think the locals were paying this price. Check before you order.",

          "This waterfall made me feel like I was living on Oahu, Hawaii again. The water is so clear you can see fish several feet down. It's a bit of a hike so be prepared for a lot of steps. The hiking path is mostly manmade and is a circle that will bring you back to where you started.",
          "Visited here after Perge. Delightfully cool in comparison. Lots of waterfalls and the cafe by the big bridge a delight to sit at over the water. Lots of tortoises and terapins seen on our walk. Pity about litter in places but a serene haven in all other ways",

          "This is an amazing place, a big park with various waterfalls and stops to admire the nature, I only wish there was a map of it. We first visited D\u00fcden Waterfalls, which are quite straightforward, so we expected something similar. However, this is a much bigger and complex park.",
          "Almost missed this but our tour guide from shopping trip took us there for 30minute stop, there were people standing on the rock below fishing while people climbed over the do not enter fence to have photos taken right on the edge of the cliff which made me feel quite sick so I",

          "This place does not need a guided tour. You can get a taxi yourself there and back. And pay for entrance fees when you\u2019re there which does not cost much. Too many people in this place as this is a tourist site. Beautiful waterfall suitable for all ages.",
          "We visited this as part of a one day excursion. Did not expect much of it and was actually pleasantly surprised. Nice stroll along the waterfalls in a pleasant setting. We were there early in the morning before it gets busy with people coming to picnic. Take the full walk",

          "this recreation and picnic spot is quite popular with the locals, even though the water practically dries up in the summer. Serene and cool, the falls are a good getaway during a hot day and, if there isn\u2019t too much of a crowd can even be quite romantic. Walkways, shady paths,",
          "Do not expect a huge waterfall. It is rather a thin and weak waterfall but the water path is covered with beautiful plantation. In summer it is extremely hot and the vegetation is pretty dried out however the winter and spring time is worth seeing. It is unfortunately a bit",
          "Basically it's a park with a main waterfall where you could take photo and stroll on the trails. At the main fall, there wasn't much space for activities, it's too small for picnic, neither is the water suitable for swimming nor fishing. There's a cafe next to a smaller",
          "Out of the 3 most popular waterfalls in Antalya this is the best. Went there in a beautiful morning and it was awesome. You need to walk but will not feel tired because of the cold splash. There is lots of selfie places. The best thing is that you need to crawl inside of the",

          "I visited this place on the way to the Manavgat waterfalls.. The Kursunlu waterfalls are not worth visiting if your only destination is here. But if you are passing by then it\u00b4s not too bad to have a look at it. be aware of two things: 1- the ticket seller guy tries to rip",
          "Beautiful scenery. Lovely cafes to enjoy a drink. But this place is not wholly wheelchair accessible.",
          "Like so many places around Antalya, there is little information online to tell you how good it is. This is not just waterfalls (which are beautiful in themselves), but the park is great. It is kept meticulously clean by the staff. There is a concrete/stone path with signposts",
          "The waterfall is worth a visit if it is on your way; otherwise it may not be feasible to bear the transportation to here. However, if you happen to visit, it offers you a nice view and a walking path in a big flora. At the end of the walking path you can drink Turkish coffee and",

          "Not the best but still nice. I think it would be best to visit first, before duden, so that you won't be disappointed.",
          "Water in this place has beautiful colour. There are few walking paths around waterfalls, it's very peaceful and relaxing",
          "Definitely disappointing after going to the Duden Falls. Not much there, it was part of a coach trip took about 30 mins that included walking to the falls and back to the coach. A bit derelict when we went.",
          "We took out 7 and 9 year old here based on the reviews we read. A 30 min taxi ride from Antalya resort found us in an area that I was not sure we were in the right place. There are small shops (shacks) and you walk through several other souvenier booths. Then, we go to the falls",

          "It's quite surprising to find this green oasis hidden away, just off the so called beaten track. It's not for anyone who has any mobility/walking problems as there are a set of steep, sometimes slippery steps to negotiate to reach the best viewing vantage points.",
          "Could not believe that these water falls where in the place because it looked like a 'flat area'. Very good park with the water falls and plenty of food and drink however you can take your own picnic! If you have any mobility issues this is definitely not for you.",
          "It is one of the best places to see in Antalya if you like natural places , but be aware it's far from the city ! But it is worth a visit , we had a wonderful village breakfast , and enjoyed the magnificent views of the natural waterfalls , fishes and even Ducks , see the photos",

          "You have to walk along a lot of steps (ups and downs) but you need to take a full circle of the park to appreciate the beauty of nature here. A great place to take some photos as well, and there are some photographers who will take pictures of you and print them out for a",

          "We visited this amazing place when we were on vacation in Antalya/Side. You pay a very small entrance fee to see this extraordinarily beautiful sight. I can assure you it is worth it. Due to Antalya's general hot and humid weather, while touring this place you feel the heat and",
          "Definitely worth a visit! If you want you can also swim under the waterfall, water is clean!.Bare in mind that during the summer season it might not be as impressive as you've seen on pictures. This because of the warm dry weather. There just isn't as much water floating through",
          "Very tourist orientated place, it doesn't need all the arcade machines and games at the top, kind of spoils it. Waterfalls itself are very pretty, lots of photo opportunities. There is no need to take a towel or swimming gear as swimming in the water is prohibited. Rated it",

          "We came on an excursion to the waterfalls and were in awe at its beauty. The mostly untouched natural setting made it into a bit of an adventure walking around. This review is only 4 stars due to the fact that it was at points slightly slippy when walking round. There are steps",

          "It is located in the shade of tall trees, it deserves visiting for enjoying the coolness, the fragrance of flowers and the soothing sounds of falling water.",
          "My experience with this waterfall was very personal I shall say! It was a very warm day and everyone (teens, kids and grown ups) felt the need to stand under the water, It was refreshing and created a very happy atmosphere!",
          "it is an actual little walk down waterfall! But,amazing view,specaily two parrots,Sebastian and Alex",
          "THIS IS NOT SUITABLE IF YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH WALKING. These waterfalls are tranquil, serene, crystal clear and very beautiful. They are a series of low falls that are interconnected to each other by pools. The paths that wind through them are not like paths we have at home.",
          "scenic and tranquil, better than duden waterfalls, entry fees are reasonable and you should tour the whole falls",
          "Its a good place but sadly we went on a very rainy day which spoiled the trip for us. Good fun place with lot of steps to climb - i recommend this waterfall",
          "The whole complex takes to a sensate level. Its preserved as it was. Nothing short of magic 12 stages of water falls set in boulders, forest and nature. Fantastic.",
          "Great place for taking pictures and looks amazing. We loved it and would always recommend this to everyone visiting Antalya area. It's around 25mins drive from Antalya city and costs only 4 lira to enter.There is a large picnic area in the woods above the falls and a couple of",
          "We visited the falls and the surrounding trails in September - during a heatwave. Though t he waterfalls and surrounding nature were nice enough, I would imagine that the waterfalls would be more spectacular in spring or early summer",
          "Really beautiful falls and pool. Not a tourist rip-off (forget Mavangat falls) a well laid out site in a lovely forest setting. Quite a few steps down and a good walk along the river but well worth it. There is a large picnic area in the woods above the falls and a couple of",
          "We visited this place twice because it's that beautiful. Great for taking pictures and looks amazing. Wife loved it and would always recommend this to everyone visiting Antalya area. It's around 25mins drive from Antalya city and costs only 4 lira to enter. There is a small",
          "Visited on organised trip. There is a walk down to the falls not steps were not designed by anyone with health and safety on mind. Don't do it if you have any mobility issues.",
          "My girlfriend and I visited here on a tour with a guide very good and lovely place to spend an hour of your day. Lots to look at and would go back in a heartbeat.",
          "very nice to walk round but be warned its not that easy if you do the full circuit. views are spectacular though.",
          "We paid 4 liera each and the views were stunning. Not a huge place but it is just stunning natural beauty. We sat at the cafe and had fresh frozen drinks whilst watching a smaller section of the falls. Lots of fish and some turtles in the water. Some people brought bread to",
          "We visited just before a big thunder storm rolled in so maybe they didn't look their best. Nice enough walk around the falls. We didn't eat there but the food being served up looked better than the norm which is usually served at these kind of places",
          "It was great and the walk was incredible. The waterfalls were picturesque and breathtaking. It took about 45 mins to walk around. However too many people",
          "First of all I recommend to go there with large groups, it is the most lovely place in Antalya and not famous as Duden waterfalls, You will be in need to walk for long distances so please take this in consideration.",
          "The whole location will bring you that wow factor. It was more or less like Kerala, India for me. There was this mini coffee shop there as well, man the view from there \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc What a discovery though. Pristine landscape, gorgeous blue-green colors this area has been perhaps",
          "Amazing and attractive place. You'll see water, A LOT OF WATER! Very nice view, a small cafe - restaurant available on the trail route. Don't miss this place out if you ever visit Antalya..",
          "The Kursunlu falls, right in the middle of Tabiat park are truly magical. While you'd typically see photos of the main falls, this place offers twelve stages of falls, each more intimate and beautiful than the other. The trail leads you through these stages and the restaurant",
          "we spent almost 4 hours in this beautiful park , there are many waterfalls which we were able to go under and take some beautiful snaps the place has all facilities and restaurants.",
          "Just perfect place for lunch or afternoon break. You can make picnic or you can have lunch or just drink in the restaurants. Could be a little bit busy during season but worth to visit.",
          "This was a bolt on to our sightseeing trip to Perge and a lovely stop-over. Unfortunately it was a real whistle-stop tour, so we did not get time to enjoy a picnic or the cafes. The steps are hard to navigate for anyone with mobility difficulties and it is also very slippery, so",
          "It is nice place for picnics, more naturally than Duden waterfalls, but Duden waterfalls is more attractive and more beautiful, and I advise those who want to visit both, to start with Kurshunlu and after that Duden.",
          "The falls are pretty, but not breathtaking like some others. There are many walkways all around the falls that offer good photo opportunities. We visited on a Saturday afternoon, and it was very crowded causing foot traffic to move at a crawl in some areas. A nice mist blows",
          "Hearing the water, seeing the waterfalls was just breath taking. You have to experience it. Although temperature on the day we visited was about 35 or 36 degrees!!",
          "Very tranquil area particularly on a hot day. Lots of steps but not difficult. Pretty vegetation and a good picnic area.",
          "we visited the Kursunlu waterfalls on a excursion. They were amazing and could of spent all day there. You cant swim in the water but it was nice to just watch.",
          "Best waterfalls we saw - but we only had 20 minutes on our tour - it could easily be an hour. There are 97 steps down (apparently) but they were not a major issue (up was a bit harder!) but the blur-green yet clear water with fish and the chance to go to the back of the falls -",
          "very nice scenery. the coffeeplace is way too expensive, but the view and scenery is worth the extra cost.",
          "The water has a very beautiful color. The whole area is actually very small, but you can spend a very pleasant hour there.",
          "I visited Kursunlu Waterfalls in August which is very hot in that region and had a wonderful day. The walk to the Waterfalls is quite slippery and sometimes going downhill so you have to be a bit fit and wear shoes that are non slippery. The pond is stunning and there were",
          "We made the trip by local bus, thoroughly enjoyed interacting with locals and seeing more. The waterfalls were lovely and well worth a look, spend the day as it was so relaxing, sitting with a drink listening to the water.",
          "Very nice and romantically sited where you can walk under the falls. Nice views between trees and sufficient room to stand and admire. However, it's a rather challenging walk back to the start - steep and slippery in places. If you are fit and foot steady, worth the challenge",
          "So, the place on the weekend spills with people. Families mainly. But at least are local people, not silly tourist as me ;) The waterfalls would have been a natural paradise before \"colonisation\". It is a good place to have a walk and some chill time",
          "This Waterfall is a little bit outside of Antalya city where you need to go either by yr car or public transportation bus services departing from the city center.This is like a paradise with its botanical garden style surroundings.\u0130f you go through its walking path,you will have",
          "Still Am in awe of the beauty of this place. What a romantic place, Green water with water falls around. Amazing place and memorable. I recommend this place as a MUST VISIT.",
          "Wonderfull nature in a green area . You should go and see this national park and waterfall. also you can eat and drink there in small cafes. view is fantastic Also it is very easy to get there by public transportation.",
          "This area was a charming situated woody area. Several smaller waterfalls in a landscape that lead you up and downhill. On your way you had fine views of a lake and yet another waterfall. As it is a very slippery affair do wear hiking-boots.",
          "I visited this waterfall on a summer day.. It was a very refreshing day.. Natural beauty.. It's very interesting to visit it.. It is very unique especially when u walk inside the cave & the waterfall downs over it.. No words can describe this green & wonderful place.. 22 km from",
          "one of the great waterfall in antalya, near to city center and also airport...more bigger area than the other 2 waterfall in antalya, there are a few small shop and cafe inside and also a camel for a short tour...it is glory waterfall and nice walking area around water...really",
          "Wonderful park, waterfall,forest,walk way,picnic area to visit. Costs for one person less than 2 us dollars. Winter or summer anytime you can visit. Not only one waterfall, everywhere is water, different tones of green, there are nice bridges, mill, fish in the water. Natural",
          "Peaceful beautiful place. It is so nice to see that it is not exploited. The colors of the water and the green leaves when I was there in May.. Relaxing.",
          "There's a nice view! Every inch of the waterfalls is beautiful!! Do take a picture when you visit! There is also a little market nearby, don't feel obligated to buy something ;)",
          "Super cute park with romantic waterfalls a bit out of town. We rented a scooter and rode it out there and it was really adventurous and fun. It was very cheap to get in, I think maybe only 5tl each (about $2.50) a person? Just a cute walk around the pools to view the",
          "What a day, need to wear good shoes for bit of rough surfaces, amazing views, go to visit in week days, weekends get very busy",
          "The Kursunlu Waterfalls are in a park area. The stairs going down to the waterfall can be very slippery so be careful. You can't swim in the water. It's very pretty and at different times of the year the water flow is bigger than we saw in September. You can walk around the park",
          "We were expecting a large waterfall, however we were a little disappointed at how little water was coming over the edge from a height. The upside was we did see some water turtles and fish.",
          "The water fall was beautiful but the steps down were wet and slippy the rail only went so far. The walk under thd falls was reported to us as great but the guide warned us it was slippy and a 20 minute walk around and back was available but strenrous, we desided against it due",
          "This park has to be one of the best maintained ones that I had visited, it is very clean and was quite cool it is a bit of a walk down so make sure you wear some decent walking shoes also it is a bit steep coming back up so take your time, this is a lovelly place to visit and",
          "Definitely the best choice for a hot day. Choose the smaller one, with park, streams, rocks and cave.",
          "This waterfall located inside a closed off park is absolutely worth the visit - if you can find out when the least busy times to visit it are then kudos to you - unfortunately when we visited it as the final stop on our tour it was incredibly packed with tourists and a lot of",
          "It was very busy when we visited and I was nearly pushed into the water by an impolite visitor, however I did not let this spoil my enjoyment of this beautiful park",
          "I visited the kursunlu waterfalls together with Perge and Aspendos, and for sure the parc and the waterfalls is a nice place to cool down during a hot summer day.. But in the end, it's a beautiful waterfall like you can find in a lot of other places over the world, nothing",
          "We visited in August and the falls were not particularly impressive. They may be better at other times of the year. I suspect that visitors from many countries would have equally or more impressive waterfalls at home. Leave this one for the locals.",
          "The water fall is very small and doesn't worth to visit it. I think it is waist of time because lots of stairs and then you only see very small waterfall.",
          "You can walk right up behind it from one direction, stunning, but you are looking out at hundreds of people so no perfect photos there. Very refreshing after the regular historical inputs. National park so very busy, especially at the weekends. Kids were loving the fish in the",
          "Only one of three waterfalls was flowing when I visited the place. A bit crowded .Good relief from the city heat and rush.",
          "Amazing part of Earth. Caves and waterfalls of exceptional beauty, and park which offers opportunity for picnic",
          "These waterfalls were beautiful to see, although after the long walk down to them I felt slightly disappointed in the area that after a couple of minutes looking at the waterfalls we were ready to go back up the steep incline.",
          "Short walk down to the main falls but then turn around and avoid going further downstream as not a lot to see further down and have a huge walk & climb back up.",
          "Beautiful waterfalls with rocky paths around them and a great restaurant by the entrance. Although small, it is a stunning sight. Totally worth your time. There is also the possibility to ride camels by the entrance - which was pretty fun.",
          "The falls are set in a delightful park area and are absolutely lovely both in colour and atmosphere. This was the setting for a very famous hair shampoo advert and is a very restful place.",
          "This waterfall is lovely and definitely worth the visit if you get the chance, the colour of the water is aqua blue and pristine",
          "Just be carefull from the family with the camals at the entrance... they almost push you on the camal and charge 10 euros for 1 person - for 2 mins they acctually pushed my family and says just a photo no problem - and then got 30 euros - tourist trap !!",
          "After seeing other meaningless waterfalls in the surroundings, I came here with very low expectations and this made me enjoy even more this very nice park. Waterfall are real waterfall, colors are lovely all around, water, trees.... There is a very nice and simple round walking",
          "not as well known as duden falls but defianlty worth a visit beautiful walk and a spectacular waterfall and on the plus side no grief from sellers",
          "These waterfalls are in center of forest very nice hicking along the river, good time spent, for a 4 KMs ballade, lovely river purely blue with some frog and fish. nice to see",
          "Great place to spent time, enjoy with the nature and listen the flowing of the water....Ottoman coffee shop is a must to stop by.",
          "This park is lovely. It's in a wooded area above Antalya and well worth the trip into the foothills to see it. Be careful on the footpaths, if wet they can be very slippery as they are made of rounded gravel. Wear good walking shoes.",
          "The view was amazing we enjoy this a lot. best place to take photos the place was clean and good.but no activities there.",
          "Just few kilometers from Antalya, take Isparta road. Theark itself is famous among families during weekends as a picnic area. The waterfalls are breathtaking, 30 minutes walking around - many stairs!",
          "As waterfalls go it is not huge but it is different,it is one of a very few that fall directly into the sea. It falls about 25m and is quite spectacular and noisy.If you want to travel there on your own it is easy from Antalya or Lara beach, 2 lira on the bus.",
          "was based in Ornekkoy so walked to the falls (10 mins) nearly every day.The falls are amazing and the surrounding park is a credit to Antalya.Plenty of seats to sit down on and the sea views, well,totally amazing.",
          "there is not only waterfall but also national park. the lovely green trees, terrace, waterfalls, fishes, ducks and cafe's must be visit who comes to Antalya...",
          "I'd highly recommend to everybody who has half a day free and is into nature. Very beautiful romantic park with lovely waterfalls. Nice place to walk near the river and just relax. Quite worse a short ride, especially in the summer heat.",
          "Beautiful place to visit we did the as part of the Thomas Cook tour with Perge and the amphitheater. One warning if you have mobility issues I would recommend giving it a miss as it can be a little precarious as the paths down to the falls are pebbles set in concrete which are",
          "lots of stairs to a very unimpressive sight. Not worth the effort, there's hardly any water in the waterfall and the pool is not interesting. The climb is impressive, though.",
          "This was a very pretty place to visit but the waterfalls are quite small and not very impressive. You would be disappointed if you were only travelling here as an excursion, but is nice as part of a group of visits.",
          "Stunning scenery and great to cool off. Visited as part of a tour of the region. Can get quite busy in the best photographic areas.",
          "Formed part of a boat trip inexpensive way to break away from your all inclusive sunbed! Don't expect Niagra because its not. Boat trips may also include visits to a bat cave another waterfall and dock in the boat basin in Antalya.",
          "We visited the waterfalls as part of a trip and didn't really know what to expect as we had not researched the falls at all. They are beautiful. A calm and cooling place which was a welcome on a hot day . We had a guide so we did not miss anything. A must see magical place",
          "We went here as part of a tour, it was nice but not as good as Duden, so if given the choice do Duden....",
          "We spent about 2 hours walking around this beautiful waterfall. There was a photographer on site who took several great pictures of us. However, I think our own were just as good. Highly recommend you take the time to explore this..",
          "This waterfall is not as commercial as Duden but has a fairy tale feel to it. It is almost dreamy, misty and mystical. I enjoyed it more than Duden and got some great photographs. The colour of the water is a surreal shade of blue and the water is so clean you can see all the",
          "It would be a lot nicer off season or maybe early in the morning when all the tour groups aren't there. The walkways are narrows and the stairs are steep so it's not ideal for young kids.",
          "Well worth a visit. Nice wooded park with picnic spots leading to some spectacular water falls set in a wooded ravine.",
          "It's generally very pleasant there. IF you go with a guided tour, you may be limited for time. It it a walk down steps to get there. At the bottome, you get a very nice view of the waterfalls. There are wild terrapins basking on the rocks. At the top, a few shops and camel rides.",
          "Kursunlu waterfalls or also known as Upper Duden waterfalls was one of my favorite stops in all of Antalya. I actually enjoyed these falls better than the notorious Duden waterfalls on the beach! For one it\u2019s within a nice shaded park with walkways, steps, and small bridges.",
          "The sight is beautiful but apart from the waterfall there is absolutely nothing to do or see. It takes 15 to 20 min to see it and take pictures. Then you climb back up and have an option to sit in a cafe with the rest of the tourists and have coffee or tea. Enjoy!",
          "lovely place - and perfect to cool off especially by the waterfall. We were only there for a short visit at the end of day out with Nirvana tours (recommend them) but when we return to Antalya we will definitely go there for a day and take a picnic.",
          "We took a taxi to these falls. They are further away from Lara Beach than the Duden Falls and very quiet in comparison. The falls themselves are less touristy (though suspect that can change during high season) so you feel like you are in a more natural environment. Be sure to",
          "Nice waterfall, good colours, too many tourists visiting. Enjoy early morning or late afternoon. If you are looking a real hike, and swimming, there are some other options on the mountain, needed a guide. Look for Atlas Megazine for trial hiking fotos, naturely preserved",
          "We were fortunate enough to arrive when there were not many tourists. There was an air of calm and although the falls are not that big the walks were very interesting. A pleasant afternnon out.",
          "spend about an hour here. Lots of tour groups going though (including the one I was in) so if possible, get there early or late to avoid too many people getting in the way of your photos!",
          "During my stay in antalya, i went to kursunlu waterfalls, it is a beautiful park, not very far from antalya downtown. The park is in a noise free region, i advise to spend there 2 or 3 hours, believe me it worth, it will be an unforgettable moment, you will be wondered by the",
          "Really the best, lovely walks, beautiful atmosphere. Strongly recommend to anyone. Good for couples, family or with friends. Don't expect a lot from the restaurants but its ok for cold beer and simple food.",
          "We went here as part of a group to se this and Perge the waterfalls you may recall from the Timotei shampoo advert as soon as you see the falls you will know the advert I mean anyway the falls are stunning but can be crowded even during this low season the path up and down was",
          "This was one of the most beautiful and naturally unspoilt places places I have ever been to. We visited this as a part of our guided tour to Aspendos and the Duden waterfalls and what a sight to behold with the old Roman and Corinthian ruins dating back thousands of years.",
          "I loved those Waterfalls. The parc around it is pleasent and you have a good restaurant to have lunch. You can visit it on the way to the airport.",
          "We were looking for it, but somehow completely missed it driving by. We caught it driving back though, and are happy that we did. There's a lot of walking to be done, and also a lot of stair climbing. If you have mobility issues, I suggest that this may not be the attraction",
          "I enjoyed it. Got great photos. I would recommend....5/5. I wouldn't visit though if I had walking problems as there are alot of steps (say, 30?) steep steps at that.",
          "Beautiful and relaxing and so peacfull. Walk around and enjoy the lovely park and falls cascading into small lakes. Very good value as well as entrance was so cheap.",

          "The Kursunlu Waterfall Natural Park is in Antalya Province of the Mediterranean Region & is about 20Km drive from Antalya. For me the main attraction was the waterfall but it does sit within nearly 400 hectares of ground, proclaimed as a Natural Park in 1991. There is about 7Km",
          "so beautifull but long way to go with stairs for old people difficult to go, but pure nature duck ponds and forest trees I enjoy it very much",

          "it is in the trees, with a very nice view, super natural park...",
          "If you feel a bit adventurous you should head out for this waterfall. Me and my wife had a good time trailing off the main tracks and just ending up next to a random waterfall :). It's quite breathtaking and rather quiet as compared to Duden. If you're looking for a day away",
          "The area was very well looked after, really easy to get too and free parking. The waterfalls were stunning. You can get right behing the falls. The park around the waterfalls were really beautiful. Definetely one of the things to do in Antalya.",
          "We looked at the pictures we took of this place and they looked so picture perfect it was hard to believe it was real. Well it most definitely was and is real. As our guide suggested, it isn't niagara falls, but its' beautiful in its' own little way.",

          "We visited Kursunlu Waterfalls in September 2011, Although, there was very little water coming from the waterfall we had a nice short walk by a little river among trees and plants. The place was relaxing and you can take nice photos there.",

          "Really not worth it at all. The website says, largest in the world and 6 miles long which is not true. None of the sculptures were more than 3m tall and you could view all of them in one glance as you enter Most of them were in disrepair. I would skip it",

          "It's true that it is not very extensively publicized attraction but it is a must see!! We went on our last day there and we loved seeing the different sculpted pieces of art! The writings for each piece were very helpful informative and interesting! We also enjoyed watching on",
          "We cycled to Sandland from our hotel (cycle routes are pretty good all along this bit of coast) and it was well worth the effort in the heat. It's simply stunning the amount of detail that these sculptures have, and whilst it isn't a large or flash affair, you just keep going",

          "Its not somewhere you could spend hours upon hours at but for the small entrance fee it is a good place to visit. My suggestion would be to get there maybr 30 minutes before sunset so you can see the sculptures both in daylight and when they get lit up. It's like a whole new",
          "I went with my husband and girls a 3 year old and a 4 year old , it was so magical to the children they wanted to take a picture with each sculpture. There was a play area and a coffee place also . The time we went was before sunset so it was perfect .",

          "I've never seen sand sculptures before, so this was an interesting visit. The selection of sculptures seemed a bit random though - you'd walk from Taj Mahal to a dragon, then a Nordic warrior, then Elsa, etc., which made it quite interesting in that you could not guess what's",
          "Its interesting but not worth the visit. Some sculptures are very nice however many of them are old and falling apart. I found it expensive 25 tl. Its very small and crowded with sculptures. not clean and the bathrooms horrible. A small cafe very dirty. Its not for kids .",

Maybe you can visit at night with the lights and everything and it might be worth it otherwise during the day don't see any point in going here. Simple sand structures, small in number.

          "What a treat to go for a late afternoon walk and encounter these falls at the end of a river lined with friendly caf\u00e9s and little eateries. It would have even nicer to have a bench to sit on overlooking the falls to just enjoy their beauty for a bit longer.",
          "When we asked to go to duden, the taxi driver took us to the upper falls, which is in the middle of the city and although it was nice, the lower falls, situated off the cliffs, are more spectatular! The park that its based in is lovely too. It costs nothing to visit the lower",
          "Beautiful waterfalls that are right in the city! Very easy to get to and before I saw the waterfall, I didn't believe that it would be there - right in the city.",
          "There was a bad smell from the entire place. We didn\u2019t know what was it... maybe from some chemicals?!?! Although it has a beautiful nature view, but there is something wrong with the source of the bad odor.. I do not recommend it",
          "Very cheap to get to, either by taxi or bus. Beautiful waterfall, with different viewing areas, inside a public park. Would recommend visiting in the evening (around 8pm) as there are less people and the small LED lights in the rocks are on, making it seem all that more",
          "The waterfall is located inside a park. The area around the waterfall is wonderful and surrounded by green trees. The food in the park is a bit pricy but the waterfall is worthy to visit.",
          "Beautiful waterfalls, but overcrowded place. Some trash can be seen in the water. There are many stalls both inside the area and outside the entrance. Prices in stalls inside about 2-3 x the price outside. Waterfalls themselves are really nice. You can climb stairs and enter",
          "Took a taxi from the old town to visit Duden Waterfalls. We went to lower Duden - though I\u2019m not sure which is better! 5TL to get in, nice to walk around and take photos. Not somewhere you could spend a whole day at but worth a visit if in the area.",
          "This waterfall is easy to reach and not too far away from the city. Given this and the scenic location it is definitely a must for all visitors in Antalya.",
          "Really enjoyed the waterfalls, amazing view and lovely caves. Location is so perfect with authentic fresh Turkish food being made and served and lots of souvenirs",
          "Absolutely beautiful and only 5 lira to go in, restaurants inside are good value and worth stopping for some lunch.",
          "Amazing view and beautiful scenery especially at sunset. However, you must explore the other side of it too.",
          "Since we went at the time of year where all the tours were booked, we thought of going to the falls ourselves! Best decision ever! because where the tours were charging US$ 200 for the experience we went there for $10 (taxi) and $10 for the entry to the falls (for me, my",

          "We visit d\u00fcden for having fun. \u0130t was not bad. There is really fantastic waterfall over there. Some caves and palace to rest. Especially athmosphare is good. Advice you to be there especially in hot days of antalya. Because it is really cold to be there. Just be carefull about",
          "If you want to see gorgeous waterfalls when in Antalya, go to Manavgat. Duden waterfalls offer a good view of the sea, mountains and sunset. It's best to chill out here in the afternoon with family, some beverage in hand or for a refreshing morning walk.",
          "A must see in Antalya. You can go there on foot, be careful some slippery areas, so put on suitable shoes. You can go there by boat too.",
          "Was wondering around Lara and came across the Duden falls on a hot summer's day. We went around 12:45 and it wasn't very busy, but it was hot as the area is flat and there are not many shaded spaces. We took pictures of the upper falls, the lower falls is accessed by boat. There",

          "This is a MUST SEE natural attraction in Antalya. There is a power and spectacularly stunning waterfall of fresh water entering directly into the Sea! We had never seen anything like it. An utterly amazing sight worth seeing. It is only a short stroll from the car park. Flat and",
          "The water falls are great ... but there is no enough care of this tourism spot... it is very nice that you can walk along the side of the river and watch the waterfalls from very close space ... but there is no care regarding the safety while going down the stairs to reach the",
          "The waterfalls themselves are truly beautiful, some of the best in Turkey. However, expect to be visiting with many other tourists and to pay an entrance fee. It has a circular path as well you can follow through the park. Be sure to go up into the caves behind the waterfall!!",
          "If you want to spend a couple of hours in a relaxing place away from the heat of the street then come here, price at the gates is cheap and the water is lovely. There are some caves just behind the water too. You will not be able to touch the water from the fall as it is",

          "We stayed in Lara cad near Lara beach. It was pretty easy to get to using public transport (bus). The waterfall is 1 part of 3 in the area. This 1 free & easy to access without a guide or booked trip. The waterfull is set in a lovely park. There are various viewing points and",
          "Duden falls are known to be the best falls in Antalya. Duden has two parts. Upper falls are far more better as it is situated in the mountain. And it gives better and closer look towards the mother nature. Lower falls are good if you are planning to take a boat ride. If you",

          "I did not know that there was such an attraction so close to the city. And it is free - no entry charges. If you are in Antalya make sure you check this out",
          "I personally love waterfalls, true beauty and so relaxing. We firstly had lunch on the riverbank which was very romantic and refreshing, menu was great. Had to walk down quite a few steps to get to the foot of the waterfall, but once down there it was great. The view of it is",
          "You can see it if you go around kaleici or at the port it's there... compared to what's around and available in antalya it's not that much of a great waterfall.. BUT it should be around you and you don't have to do anything to see it so good enough",
          "Upper waterfalls: they close by 7-8pm (in June). Great family trip with a small fee of 3-5 Lira. gardens and play areas for kids. Parrots for taking pictures and cafe with a shisha ( narjila) beside the river and falls. Public transport is available using number 66 or 78.",
          "There is a park around the fall, and a bridge so you can see where it falls over the edge. Lots of flowers in the landscaped park Fixed paths, so no problems for buggies. Short walk from town if you want to go for something to eat.",
          "I had seen this waterfall from a boat trip and was impressed. This year I saw it from the land side and found it was not so impressive. I would recommend any who wants to see it to go by boat on the sea, but there are plenty of gardens to walk around on the land side.",
          "We were mesmerized by the overwhelming waterfalls. A lot of remarkable photos were taken there. Give a try to the cave, where a quite good view awaits you.",
          "Hired a private speed boat. Went to the caves and waterfalls with the tunes blasting away. Breeze was a delight. Swam under the waterfall and then headed back. Cost 150 Euro for private boat and we were allowed to drive. Would recommend to break the day up.",

          "I visited as part of a Thomas Cook tour, the waterfall is beautiful, it\u2019s the largest waterfall in the world that falls into the sea and definitely worth photographing.

          "Nice place and near by the city Safe for children Ladies sale hand made necklaces Shops sale Ice cream and cold water",
          "Its hard to say how it feels to be there.. when you are visiting this place out of the main season you will find it quiet and relaxing. You can rest in the shadow or visit some of the caffees around the river or you just can stare at the waterfall and listen it - I could do it",

          "You have to take a tour by boat to get here because it is a bit at the corner of the city. Would not suggest any expensive city tours for half or full day. Just go to Kaeici marina and get a two hour tour from any operator there and ask for half the price they offer. In two",

        "wiki": "Antalya (Turkish pronunciation: [an\u02c8talja]) is the fifth-most populous city in Turkey and the capital of Antalya Province. Located on Anatolia's southwest coast bordered by the Taurus Mountains, Antalya is the largest Turkish city on the Mediterranean coast outside the Aegean region with over one million people in its metropolitan area.The city that is now Antalya was first settled around 200 BC by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon, which was soon subdued by the Romans. Roman rule saw Antalya thrive, including the construction of several new monuments, such as Hadrian's Gate, and the proliferation of neighboring cities. The city has changed hands several times, including to the Seljuk Sultanate in 1207 and an expanding Ottoman Empire in 1391. Ottoman rule brought relative peace and stability for the next five hundred years. The city was transferred to Italian suzerainty in the aftermath of World War I, but was recaptured by a newly independent Turkey in the War of Independence.\nAntalya is Turkey's biggest international sea resort, located on the Turkish Riviera. Large-scale development and governmental funding has promoted tourism. A record 12.5 million tourists passed through the city in 2014.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city was founded as \"Attaleia\" (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), named after its founder Attalos II, king of Pergamon. This name, still in use in Greek, was later evolved in Turkish as Adalia and then Antalya. Attaleia was also the name of a festival at Delphi and Attalis (Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c2) was the name of an old Greek tribe at Athens.  Despite the close similarity, there is no connection with the name Anatolia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKing Attalus II of Pergamon is looked on as founder of the city in about 150 BC, during the Hellenistic period. It was named Attaleia or Attalia (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) in his honour. The city served as a naval base for Attalus's powerful fleet. Excavations in 2008, in the Do\u011fu Garaj\u0131 plot, uncovered remains dating to the 3rd century BC, suggesting that Attalea was a rebuilding and expansion of an earlier town.\n\nAttalea became part of the Roman Republic in 133 BC when Attalus III, a nephew of Attalus II bequeathed his kingdom to Rome at his death in 133 BC. The city grew and prospered during the Ancient Roman period and was part of the Roman province of Pamphylia Secunda, whose capital was Perga.\nChristianity started to spread to the region even in the 1st century: Antalya was visited by Paul of Tarsus and Barnabas, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: \"Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, and from there they sailed to Antioch\". Some of the bishops attributed to the episcopal see of Attalea in Pamphylia may instead have been bishops of Attalea in Lydia (Yanantepe), since Le Quien lists them under both sees. No longer a residential bishopric, Attalea in Pamphylia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.The 13th-century Seljuk mosque at Attalea, now in ruins, had been a Christian Byzantine basilica from the 7th century. The Great Mosque had also been a Christian basilica and the Kesik Minare Mosque had been the 5th-century Christian Church of the Panaghia or Virgin and was decorated with finely carved marble. The archaeological museum at Attalia houses some sarcophagi and mosaics from nearby Perga and a casket of bones reputed to be those of St. Nicholas, the bishop of Myra, further down the Turquoise coast.\nAntalya was a major city in the Byzantine Empire. It was the capital of the Byzantine Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots, which occupied the southern coasts of Anatolia. According to the research of Speros Vryonis, it was the major naval station on the southern Anatolian coast, a major commercial center, and the most convenient harbor between the Aegean Sea and Cyprus and points further east. Besides the local merchants, \"one could expect to see Armenians, Saracens, Jews, and Italians.\"At the time of the accession of John II Comnenus in 1118 Antalya was an isolated outpost surrounded by Turkish beyliks, accessible only by sea. Following the fall of Constantinople in 1204, Niketas Choniates records that one Aldebrandus, \"an Italian by birth who was strictly raised according to Roman tradition\" controlled Antalya as his own fief. When Kaykhusraw, sultan of the Seljuk Turks attempted to capture the city in 1206, Aldebrandus sent to Cyprus for help and received 200 Latin infantry who defeated the attackers after a siege of less than 16 days. Kaykhusraw would take Antalya the following year and build its first mosque.. People of Christian were rebelled and captured Antalya with aid of Walter of Montb\u00e9liard in 1212. Briefly restored Byzantine rule in Antalya was ended by Kaykaus I in 1216.\n\nThe city and the surrounding region were conquered by the Seljuk Turks in the early 13th century. Antalya was the capital of the Turkish beylik of Teke (1321\u20131423) until its conquest by the Ottomans, except for a period of Cypriot rule between 1361 and 1373. The Arabic traveler Ibn Battuta, who visited the city in 1335\u20131340, noted:\nFrom Alanya I went to Antaliya [Adalia], a most beautiful city. It covers an immense area, and though of vast bulk is one of the most attractive towns to be seen anywhere, besides being exceedingly populous and well laid out. Each section of the inhabitants lives in a separate quarter. The Christian merchants live in a quarter of the town known as the Mina [the Port], and are surrounded by a wall, the gates of which are shut upon them from without at night and during the Friday service. The Greeks, who were its former inhabitants, live by themselves in another quarter, the Jews in another, and the king and his court and Mamluks in another, each of these quarters being walled off likewise. The rest of the Muslims live in the main city. Round the whole town and all the quarters mentioned there is another great wall. The town contains orchards and produces fine fruits, including an admirable kind of apricot, called by them Qamar ad-Din, which has a sweet almond in its kernel. This fruit is dried and exported to Egypt, where it is regarded as a great luxury.\nIn the second half of the 17th century Evliya \u00c7elebi wrote of a city of narrow streets containing 3,000 houses in 20 Turkish and four Greek neighborhoods. The town had grown beyond the city walls and the port was reported to hold up to 200 boats.\nIn the 19th century, in common with most of Anatolia, its sovereign was a \"dere bey\" (landlord or landowner). The family of Tekke O\u011flu, domiciled near Perge had been reduced to submission in 1812 by Mahmud II, but continued to be a rival power to the Ottoman governor until the early 20th century, surviving by many years the fall of the other great beys of Anatolia. The records of the Levant (Turkey) Company, which maintained an agency in Antalya until 1825, documented the local dere beys.In the early 20th century, Antalya had two factories spinning and weaving cotton. As of 1920, the factories had 15,000 spindles and over 200 looms. A German-owned mill baled cotton. There were gin mills.In the 20th century the population of Antalya increased as Turks from the Caucasus and the Balkans moved into Anatolia. The economy was centered on its port that served the inland areas, particularly Konya. Antalya (then Adalia) was picturesque rather than modern. The chief attraction for visitors was the city wall, and outside a promenade, a portion of which survives. The government offices and the houses of the higher classes were outside the walls.\n\nAs of 1920, Antalya was reported as having a population of approximately 30,000. The harbor was described as small, and unsafe for vessels to visit in the winter. Antalya was exporting wheat, flour, sesame seeds, livestock, timber and charcoal. The latter two were often exported to Egypt and other goods to Italy or other Greek islands, who received mainly flour. In 1920, the city had seven flour mills. Wheat was imported, and then processed in town before exportation. Antalya imported manufactured items, mainly from the United Kingdom.The city had a Greek minority that made up 1/3 of the population until the population exchange.Antalya also had a tiny Armenian population which had a Church on the street of\"Hamam \u00e7ikmazi\"named Hovhannes Surp Garabed,which was later on demolished.Antalya also had a Jewish community which had a tiny Synagogue in the neighborhood of Balbey and a Talmud Tora ,The Synagogue was closed in 1948 and its exact location is not known and the Synagogue might not exist anymore.The Jewish community had 2 graveyards and one was located across \"Donerciler carsisi\"and was demolished when the area was opened to construction ,But one marble tombstone belonging to a Jewish person named Raphael Moshe was transferred to the Antalya Museum where you can see the tombstone in the museums garden.\nThe city was occupied by the Italians from 28 March 1919 to 5 July 1921 during Turkish War of Independence. Large-scale development beginning in the 1970s transformed Antalya from a pastoral town into one of Turkey's largest metropolitan areas. Much of this has been due to tourism, which expanded in the 21st century. In the 1985 singing diva Dalida held her last concert in Antalya.\nAntalya was the host city for the 2015 G-20 summit and the EXPO 2016. Five countries have their consular missions in Antalya including Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Belgium and Serbia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area is shielded from the northerly winds by the Taurus Mountains. Antalya has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with hot and dry summers and mild and rainy winters. Around 300 days of the year are sunny, with nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight per year. The mean sea temperature ranges between 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in winter and 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) in summer. The highest record air temperature reached 45.4 \u00b0C (113.7 \u00b0F) on 1 July 2017 which normally averages as high as 34.4 \u00b0C (93.9 \u00b0F) and the lowest record dropped to \u22124.6 \u00b0C (23.7 \u00b0F) in February, when the low average is as low as 6.1 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the Address-Based Birth Recording System showed a metropolitan population of 1,001,318 (502,491 male; 498,827 female). Source for 1530\u20131889\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAgricultural production includes citrus fruits, cotton, cut flowers, olives, olive oil and bananas. Antalya Metropolitan Municipality's covered wholesale food market complex meets 65% of the fresh fruit and vegetable demand of the province.Since 2000, shipyards have been opened in Antalya Free Zone, specialized in building pleasure yachts. Some of these yards have advanced in composites boat building technology.\nCorendon Airlines and SunExpress are headquartered in Antalya.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDespite having architectural heritage dating back up to Hellenistic times, most historical architecture in Antalya date to the medieval Seljuk period, with a number of mosques, madrasahs, masjids, caravanserais, Turkish baths and tombs giving the city a Turkish-Islamic character. Historical architecture is concentrated in the walled city, Kalei\u00e7i; ancient structures are not well-preserved in the rest of the city of Antalya as the modern city was built on the ancient city. Kalei\u00e7i, with its narrow cobbled streets of historic Ottoman era houses, is the old center of Antalya. With its hotels, bars, clubs, restaurants, and shopping, it has been restored to retain much of its historical character. It is surrounded by two walls in the shape of a horsenail, one of which is along the seafront, built in a continuous process from Hellenistic to Ottoman times. The historical harbour is located in this part of the city; narrow streets extend from the harbour and branch off into the old city, surrounded by wooden historical houses. Cumhuriyet Square, the main square of the city and a spot very popular for tourists and locals, is surrounded by shopping and business centres and public buildings. There are sites with traces of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Seljuk architecture and cultures. There are also examples of the local Greek architecture in the city, with five Greek Orthodox churches in the old city.The walled city is surrounded by a large metropolitan area. With high rates of immigration since the 1970s, this area contains large gecekondu neighborhoods that are not well-integrated into the fabric of the city and suffer from poor economic conditions and insufficient education. Gecekondu areas are concentrated in the Kepez district, where an estimated 70% of the houses were gecekondus in 2008. In 2011, it was estimated that there were 50\u201360,000 gecekondus in Antalya, housing around 250,000 people.Antalya has beaches including Konyaalt\u0131, Lara and Karpuzkald\u0131ran. Beyda\u011flar\u0131 and Saklikent are used for winter sports.\n\n\n=== Historic sites in the city center ===\nAncient monuments include the City Walls, H\u0131d\u0131rl\u0131k Tower, Hadrian's Gate (also known as Triple Gate), and the Clock Tower.\nHadrian's Gate: constructed in the 2nd century by the Romans in honor of the Emperor Hadrian.\n\u0130skele Mosque: A 19th-century Mosque near the marina.\nKaratay Medrese: A Medrese (Islamic theological seminary) built in 1250 by Emir Celaleddin Karatay.\nKesik Minare (Broken Minaret) Mosque: Once a Roman temple then converted to a Byzantine Panayia church and finally into a mosque.\nTekeli Mehmet Pa\u015fa Mosque: An 18th-century Mosque built in honor of Tekeli Mehmet Pa\u015fa.\nYat Liman\u0131: the harbour dating to Roman era.\nYivli Minare (Fluted Minaret) Mosque: Built by the Seljuks and decorated with dark blue and turquoise tiles. This minaret eventually became the symbol of the city.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\n\n=== Green areas, recreation places ===\n\nThere are urban parks and protected natural areas located outside the cities, allowing the people to have fun, rest and get closer to nature. Some of them are green areas around lake, pond and dam lakes, and some are highland and forest areas.\nThe prime urban green areas include Antalya City Forest, Atat\u00fcrk Park, Kepez City Forest.\nThe largest amusement park in Antalya is the Aktur Park. Other modern recreational areas include 3 aquaparks in the city, Konyaalt\u0131, Lara beaches, Beachpark especially for summer holidays, while Sakl\u0131kent also has facilities for skiing in the winter months.\nThe preserved nature areas include G\u00fcll\u00fck Mountain National Park in Antalya-Korkuteli highway, Mount Olympus National Park in Kemer and D\u00fcden and Kur\u015funlu Waterfalls. Other protected areas include the Damlata\u015f and the Karain Cave and the Guver Cliff.\nIt offers picnic and recreation facilities in various parts of the city. Picnic areas, rafting facilities in K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Kanyon in Manavgat. The part of Korkuteli-Antalya border in western part of Antalya is covered with forests. In these areas, picnic areas, playground, restaurant and similar facilities are provided. There are lake and forest views on the promenade at Feslikan Plateau to the west of the city center where visitors can also enjoy nature sports and nature walks. The oil wrestling competition festival organized in summer,  what accompanied with concerts . The pond in Doyran town, located to the west of city is very suitable for picnic and fishing.\nIn addition to the open air recreation areas,   the number of shopping centers, which have increased rapidly in recent years, can also be classified as a rest area with the facilities they offer. The shopping centers in the city are gathered in the center. Among the leading shopping centers in the city are Antalya 5M Migros, Antalya Kipa, Laura, Shemall, Deepo and \u00d6zdilekpark.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe mayor of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality is Muhittin B\u00f6cek of the CHP, in office since 2019. For general elections, Antalya elects 18 Members of Parliament to the Turkish Grand National Assembly.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\nAntalya has traditionally been seen as a stronghold for the Kemalist centre-left party Republican People's Party (CHP). Being the capital of the fifth most populous province in Turkey, Antalya is politically strategic and has been a target for the governing center-right Justice and Development Party (AKP). The AKP unexpectedly won control of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality in the 2004 local election. The AKP won a plurality in Antalya in the 2007 general election, symbolising the city's political transformation from a CHP stronghold to a CHP-AKP marginal battleground in the 21st century. The loss of Antalya was a major political setback for the CHP not only because of its significance as a centre for tourism, but also because the CHP's former leader Deniz Baykal is a Member of Parliament for the province. The province is divided into 19 districts.\nThe CHP regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2009 local elections, though the AKP won a plurality in the 2011 general election. The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) also have a strong political base in Antalya, winning approximately between 15 and 25% of the vote in elections since 2007. The city voted in favour of the AKP government's proposed constitutional reforms in the 2007 referendum, but voted against the reforms proposed in 2010.\nIn the 2014 local elections, Antalya once again voted for the AKP, with the MHP taking support away from the CHP by winning a record 24.3% of the vote. The CHP subsequently accused the AKP of systematic electoral fraud, and the presence of government minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu at one of the vote counting centres drew strong condemnation. In the 2014 presidential election, the CHP and MHP's joint candidate Ekmeleddin \u0130hsano\u011flu won 53.08% of the vote. The AKP's candidate Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan won 41.63% of the vote, and the HDP democratic socialist candidate Selahattin Demirta\u015f won 5.30% of the vote. Antalya was a hotspot for the 2013\u201314 anti-government protests against the AKP.The secular main opposition, CHP, regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2019 local elections.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe football club of Antalya, Antalyaspor plays in the S\u00fcper Lig.

I\u2019m not sure what it was like in the past but i went on the 24th july 2018. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably one of the better zoo\u2019s i\u2019ve",

          "OK so if you are lazy, over weight or have a physical disability then please do not bother to go. The reason I say this is because once you get there by tram which you catch from the city centre to faith (the last stop) you have to walk 15 minutes to the entrance. It does not",
          "Not the best zoo I have been too. Hardly any staff. No where to get drinks and it gets very hot. Animals seem very lonely. There was one tiger stuck in a small room and clearly wanted to be outside but no one came to let him out. Needs improvement but it is okay",

          "Good place to go! Very affordable! Lots of animals, clean park with many places to stop for picnic, kids playgrounds and nice shades to protect from the sun. Take something to eat and drink with you, there are no shops, one guy was selling some toys and peanuts at the entrance.",

          "Ok so this zoo is cute but not spectacular and nothing compared to whispenade zoo, HOWEVER it only cost us 5tl each and so we weren't expecting much. There was no large felines so no lions, tigers or lynx. There were a lot of other smaller animals and they had a nice collection",

          "This cost us 5TL per person to enter which was very cheap given the animals here. Unfortunately due to the hot climate they do not move much and are often in huts meaning you don't get a great sighting. There are no shops or vending machines so you need to take your own food",

A difficult mountain route into Phrygia began at Perga, and Alexander the Great used it for his invasion of the interior. Long the chief city of the district of Pamphylia Secunda, Perga was superseded in Byzantine times by its port, Attaleia, which became a metropolis in 1084. The most notable remains at Perga include a theatre, a stadium, two basilicas, and the agora.. ",

          "Perge is mentioned in the Bible in the region of Pamphylia. The apostle Paul went there and preached. See Acts 14:25. It is in remarkably good condition, better than Ephesus in many regards. We went on a guided tour which also took us to Aspendos and Kurunsulu waterfalls. A",
          "A lot of history and a very calm and serene place. we went as part of a guided tour which was nice. There arent many amenities there besides toilets if you go as part of an excursion you might get supplied some water bottles but if you go on your own via taxi etc take your own",
          "I went here with a group. There was a guide but it is easy enough to get lost on your own here. A visually impressive group of ruins, comprising theaters, pillars, gates, and baths - among other constructions. The cats on site are extremely friendly!",

You can rent a car and drive yourself so many chances to stop and enjoy. By the way, highways are enough safe and new in Turkey last",
          "My second visit here in five years. The size and condition of Perge is absolutely fascinating. Sadly, there are no audio guides available or even a map to enhance your experience. Next visit I would consider employing a personal guide to bring the experience to life, rather than",
          "The city covers a huge area, there seems to be many buildings still to discover. The columns were incredible, so many of them. The stadium is also worth seeing, as is the theatre. All the statues from the theatre can be seen in Antalya Museum. Well worth a visit.",
          "We had a guided tour through the ancient city. I would not recommend doing it any other way. The city excavations are still in progress but that which is open for tourists is enough to keep you busy for a few hours. The city is a great illustration of the country's and region's",

          "Getting there: Take the tram (direction EXPO) and get off at \"Aksu\" stop. Walk 15-20 minutes, and you're there! Highlights: - the stadium, the columned streets, the agora, the Byzantine gate. The theatre was not accessible on the day we visited, don't know if this is so",

          "Our first sight of Perge was a pile of rocks (ruins) on the ground, which was very disappointing and not what we expected! As we went round the corner we were greeted by buildings that were being reconstructed. Walk down the main collanade which is lined with reconstructed",
          "This is a place where history needs to coincide with ones imagination in order to enjoy this marvellous site. The ancient city of perge is located on the harbour so expect it to be humid and hot, with alot of walking.",

          "Archeologists are uncovering more artifacts all the time at this site. Many of the marble statues discovered in the last 5 years are on display in the Antalya Archeological Museum. You can stroll down wide streets lined with marble columns. There is very little shade so it can",
          "A must see place... Very well preserved old town... Do not miss the Archeological Museum of Antalya to see the sculptures and artifacts. Make sure you reserve enough time to visit Perge and definitely you will need water and good walking shoes. Life & Desire",
          "Wow, what a great day. Recommend you visit the museum in Antalya first to see the truly stunning statues and treasures discovered during archaeological digs over recent years at Perge. It's a shame they haven't put resin copies of the statues in situ in Perge which would be",
          "Worth the effort of travelling there. Guides and tour arrangements are usually excellent, a day well spent for anybody interested in archaeology of ancient history",
          "This place is massive and while much of it is unexcavated, the main roads are splendid and the mosaics floors of the bath and other buildings are covered with gravel but your guide will know where the spots are that can be seen. Hike to the top of the hill for a really great",
          "This site is like 20 min drive from Belek towards Antalya. I spent here about 2 hours with my daughter of 8 y.o. The parking is free of charge, the ticket was 25TL, kids go free. They told me that starting August 31st, the ticket would be 35TL per adult. Wear sun screen, hats",
          "Did the excursion here from TUI. Also includes Aspendos Ampitheatre. Not as well preserved as Ephesus but still very good, with lots of features still intact.",
          "We travelled to Perge by metro/tram from Antalya (45 minutes) get off at AKSU its about 2 kilometre easy walk. ..so avoiding the expensive tours. It was very easy. Perge itself is a partially and well restored roman city stretched over a large site. Probably need a couple of",
          "Over the past twenty five years we have watched the ancient city emerge. The archaeologists have done a stunning job. I am not a great fan of reconstructions but at Perge it has been done most sympathetically. Although much less well known, in its day it must have rivalled the",
          "I visited this and the amount of ruins of the old City are stunning to see and the columns still standing are amazing. You must take water with you and also good walking shoes as it is rocky and the paths are not even. There is boards up around the city explaining each area",
          "A fantastic site with amazing ruins, we hired a guide which helped add detail and history. You need to be well prepared if you are going to manage the whole site as it\u2019s massive and not much shade (obviously) . Most of the mosaics are covered and renovations are ongoing but",
          "The Greco-Roman ruins of Perge, an ancient city that was once the capital of Pamphylia, are very near Antalya. Its ruins include a theatre, a pal\u00e6stra, a temple of Artemis and two churches. The ruins are vast and you should allow plenty of time if you want to explore the whole",
          "Worth visiting while in Antalya. A whole city of ancient Roman times. Try to reach the end of the main 'street'. Our guide warned against buying coins from peddlers or picking up pebbles to bring back home.",
          "During our recent one and a half day visit to Antalya in Turkey, me and my family stayed in private accommodation in the old town or \u2018Kaleici\u2019 as it is locally called.

          "I've enjoyed my visit to Perge, stayed there for almost 4/5 hours and still couldn't get enough. It worth a visit if you're in Antalya and like ancient archaeological things. They could maybe put more (information) signs. Don't forget to visit the theatre which is outside of",
          "Also known as Perga this is a very large - and impressive - archaeological site. It used to be the capital of the region and the acropolis dates back to the Bronze Age. Hire a guide otherwise you may not understand all the history.",
          "Yet again another great site to visit, you get the true feeling of a Roman city with streets lined with column ,a running stadium, and an amphitheatre as well",
          "Perge is great. In fact it was captured by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC. Then it became a has-been when the river serving the bustling port silted up leaving the harbour 12k from the sea, about as useful as a lighthouse in the desert. The Romans left and nothing",
          "If you visit Antalya, you have to visit this beautiful historical site as well. I couldn't see any audio guides,and haven't asked,but you better find some information before the visit.",
          "Was the first city ruins I have visited in Turkey and I wish we had a guide and in wish we had more time (unfortunately we only planned it as a 2 hour stop over on the way to another city). It was clear there was so much hidden, and so many stories beneath the stones. Even with",
          "Visited in September. Had visited over 30 ancient cities on a recent visit to Turkey and this was one of the better ones to see. Extensive excavations have been completed. Many fairly complete buildings exist. Most impressive feature to us was the long colonnaded streets in such",
          "Perge has undergone quite extensive excavation and is surprisingly complete. The visitor is able to walk around this ancient Roman town and get a clear feel for what it was like back then. The Roman baths, the stadium and amphitheater are all pretty complete as is the main road.",
          "Spent more than an hour in this place. Amazing ruins and really cool to wander around and explore this Roman beauty. I highly recommend going there with a guide coz there's just a lot to learn!",

          "Fantastic to see the progress being made by the archeological team clearly with government investment. If this was in the UK it would be the single most spectacular ancient site in the country, preserved by National Trust. Here it\u2019s just some ruins off the beaten track, which",

          "If this is your thing then you will not be disappointed. A great place with lots to see. Entrance fee also includes the amphitheatre across the road. One of the best visited since ephesus a few years ago. If you are staying in antalya make your own way. The new tram system will",

          "Having visited many ancient sites over the years, I was really impressed with the freedom to move around. Go here before you visit the museum in Antalya. Take plenty of water and a hat it's hot. Expect to spend 3 hours taking it all in. Excellent site.",
          "Well worth the trip out from Antalya, partcularly if you can get a guide like the one we had from Cicerone Travel. He was full of lots of information about Perge that we would have difficulty finding out on our own. A very big site with lots of interesting features but remember",
          "It looks to be in a open book of history! The work are still in progress but it s already very enjoyable",
          "Firstly, on behalf of my daughter and I a massive thank you to Adam our tour guide. After 4 years of our quest to travel the world we have never met a nicer and more knowledgeable guide than Adam. Perge is an archaeological site dating back to the Greek and Roman empires.A lot",
          "We visited as part of a multi-stop guided tour, so I\u2019ll review Perge as a location (not the guided tour). Purge is a huge site - both in size and it\u2019s significance in the history of the country. It has clearly been painstakingly and meticulously archived, cleaned and restored",
          "we went with a trip and our guide adam was very knowlegeable which helps you to get the feel for the history of this site. these are ruins so it is all outside in the heat be prepared there is a shop with drinks and ice creams to cool down",
          "I would like to start off by saying a HUGE thankyou to Yunus for calling me back and making me and my family feel welcome at your office. Your mannerism, professionalism and patience is brilliant. I was stressed out as I had limited time at Atlanya and you helped plan my tours",

          "an historical place in the middle of city with the narrow alley and nice cafe in it where you feel history in it and you can know why Antalya is center tourism in Turkey",
          "After seeing the mind-blowing display of statues, sarcophagi and artifacts in the Antalya Museum, we had to go and visit where they were found : Perge. As most archeological sites in Turkey (or the world, for that matter), it is very much a work in progress. But already a lot",
          "A Roman / Greek city of huge history. We hired a car to visit but many tours are available. Lots to see and a real insight to ancient civilisations. Read about the site before visiting and take sun protection as there is a lot of walking and little shade",
          "Perge is yet another place in Turkey that has its roots in ancient history and the roman period. Similar to the style of Ephesus, it is worth a visit for the archaeological lovers and people interested in history. The place is moderately well preserved.",

          "Perge is a huge sight well worth the visit. Be prepared to walk a lot to see all the ruins. The Amphitheatre is separate but probably the main attraction. I had a great guide in Uraz from Cicerone Travel, highly recommended!",
          "What a beautifull site! we had a day tour visiting both aspendos & perge and it was worth it totally! Antalya has so much to offer to broaden your experience beyond the abundance of oversized & overcompensating hotels. We had a personal guide, which was an instant succes for",
          "Nice and authentic city which is still being excavated. Good facilities and not crowded when we were there. You are able to walk the streets and crawl over ruins where people walked and lived more than 2000 years ago. Walk at least the main street to the end. Climbing the hill",
          "This place is to be seen as it is well preserved. First you can see a 3D movie about the place and then you can explore the whole place for hours! I was impressed about how big this place is, huge theatre, stadion, main road with many colums and offcourse a mosaic. From a small",
          "This is a very impressive ancient site. It is very extensive with two long ancient roads running through the site, lined with columns and the remains of an ancient water channel running down the centre of the ancient road. The huge, and almost complete stadium must be one of the",
          "The site was almost empty when we visited on a Saturday AM. One of 2 sites we visited that day: Perge, Aspendos and Side. It is the most extensive and an interesting complement to the other two. The scale of the city and its public buildings is most impressive, as is the state",
          "Not worth the money, bought a pass for all the meusems in Antalya. Nothing really to see, skipped most of it due to lack of stuff to see.",
          "We visited the Perge Ancient City as a part of an excursion to Perge, Aspendos and Side. The Ancient City itself was amazing and a delight to walk through. Very highly recommended with a tour guide to fully appreciate it!",
          "Perge is simply stunning. It helped that we had an excellent and informative guide. It was a very hot day so its essential to wear comfortable shoes and have a bottle of water.",
          "Although It was expensive and not organized there is to tour guide no map and no audio to guide you through it, it is very interesting to see however you have to go to Antalya museum to understand the story. There is a small bazaar outside of local people however they don\u2019t",
          "Ancient city. Great ruins. Great history and stories. Much of it still preserved. Good to visit whilst in the area",
          "If you are a history buff you will have this on your radar anyway and if you are not you should still visit and get some culture. Very interesting site with amazing opportunity at some stunishing photos. Definitely recommend.",
          "Perge is a beautiful ruin! Turkey is so lucky that it has so many Greek and Roman archaeological sites! We spent most of the day just walking around and inspecting the area. It's fantastic and a History lover's paradise! A must-see.",
          "not that well preserved but OK to stop here if you are also going to Aspendos. The history is interesting as the city did not resist Alexander the Great and welcomed Christians with open arms (St Paul visited) early on.",
          "Amazing experience with our guide .. he told us alot about ancient times . It's an honour to know that much about 2500 years ago. We loved the Aspendos theatre it's beautiful",
          "Although in October in Antalya is a lovely wheater (28-31 Celsius degrees), we didn't go to the beach every day, so we decided to visit the Perge Ancient City! If you are interested in history you will be very pleased to see this impressive roman-greeks ruins from ancient times!",
          "Guess, this was not my taste. The place was deserted when I visited. And I was never into too much of history so this place kind of bored me a lot. Also, if you are planning to visit, better rent a car or take a taxi.",
          "Perge is an ancient city, near Antalya. It's one of the most impressive ruins in the area, although there are definitely others around - it's also the closest to Antalya which, in a hired car with a fractious kid, made sense to try first. Originally Iain had an ambitious plan",

          "This place is huge but could be so much better. We had a tour guide from a coach trip but I needed to know so much more and was left disappointed. It's still being developed at a snail's place and id love to visit it again upon completion . Don't be put off by the amount of",
          "We have been to may of the ancient sites in the region. This place stands out for its open access that is permitted to the entire city. You can walk pretty much every where in the city. There are active excavations (Nov 2017), rebuilding of towers, walls, and you can simply walk",
          "Not for summer for sure, the sun will be on top of you burning you. I suggest to visit in a cooler period for sure.",
          "well preserved ancient city in quiet setting. should wear good walking shoes and bring good camera for photos. must visit.",
          "We walked to Perge from the tram station which isnt far and easy to find. Would be no good for anyone with a buggy! We enjoyed it although it was a good walk round but thats what made it worth while. Massively unpriced in my opinion. The theatre opposite is well worth a look",
          "Getting to Perge is SO easy .Take the Antray tram to Asku (Expo direction) and it's a 2km/15 minute walk from there. Walk the same chariot rutted street that the Apostle Paul walked in 46AD .",
          "Nothing much to say but I LOVE everything in this place. The ancient ruin, ambiance of the place, and we visited Perge when the weather just perfect. I was amazed when I set my foot in front of the main gate as the place is large, there are so many things to explore in each",
          "We visited both the Perge & Aspendos sites via a TUI half day excursion from Side for \u00a328. TUI use the local TANTUR TURIZM SEYAHAT AS agency who sent an English speaking guide who was very knowledgeable & passionate about both these ancient sites. Perge was a much larger site",
          "This site is not that famous but it is well worh the visit. Known for the preaching of St-Paul, its hellenistic gate and a well preserved theatre, it spreads over a large area and encompasses a hill which is the site of the barely visible acropolis. The site is remarkable for",
          "We visited as part of a private tour through Turkey. Perge is relatively close to Antalya and so does not take up a lot of time to include in your itinerary. The baths are one of the better preserved we saw and the hippodrome is also well preserved.",
          "What a beautiful place. You can see it, touch it, smell the history. Unlike the usual places in Europe with rope barriers, Perspex shields and stay behind me lines.... this is a very tactile place to visit. We hired a private guide (archaeologist- Aykut Alt\u0131n\u0131\u015f\u0131k) Artuk to take",
          "Enjoyed this so much . Incredible to think that we were walking where St Paul has been. Lots of info on the different areas . Very hot but some areas of shade have been providdd and there is a nice little shop where you can get a drink and browse some wellriced souvenirs",
          "Amazing trip. This is a must when visiting Antayla. Wander around these breath taking ruins and soak up the history. Well worth a visit.",
          "Totally worth the trip. Worth getting a guided tour to explain the history. Would say an hour to hour and a half is sufficient time wise here. Only gets a 4 purely because our guide took far too long explaining detail and after 2 and a half hours became very hot and almost",
          "Not far from Belek, were we stayed, we also picked a trip which included a visit to the ancient site of Aspendos. Both sites were fantastic, only suggestion try doing them in the morning as the sites are fairly open and would get very hot in the afternoon. Perge is a fairly flat",
          "It is not far from Antalya, I traveled by car, entrance is quite expensive 25tl. But the ruins are very impressive. The colonnaded Main Street it very beautiful, towers and stadium very impressive, the theater is beautiful, worth visiting.",

          "The city of Perge is one of the top attractions in antalya. Yet it is very hot there and a trip from the city is exhausting. It is worth spending few hours there.",
          "This is a well preserved Roman town with the best hippodrome that I have seen. There is also a fine main street and shopping area with central fountain that used to run down the middle. Our guide remarked nevertheless that some of the restoration work is being done clumsily.",
          "Must see before a trip to Aspendos and Side .The site is large and flat good walking shoes are a must. Also it is best to take a guided tour to save on time .",
          "Its a very nice place where u can relax and visit something great. Great photos , great rewievs . Go with family",
          "I'd highly recommend a trip to these ruins. A lot of walking and in the heat exhausting so go prepared take plenty of water and sun cream and good walking shoes. Really interesting to see such intact ruins. If you are into your history this is a must.",
          "The ruins are well worth worth a visit.Just a short distance from Antalya aaaathis our second visit.Great for history lovers.",
          "Beautiful ancient city, which is allegedly visited by St. Peter in his time. You can feel how people lived in the streets, there is still a lot standing (or reconstructed).",
          "Close to the city of Antalya, this place amazes. If you're in the area, you'd be very disappointed if you didn't take time to visit this amazing city ruin. The quality, scope, and sophistication of this archaeological site is one that leaves little to the imagination. While many",
          "We went to Perge as part of a tour and it was incredible! It's amazing how much has been preserved and the fact that really very little of the city has been uncovered is incredible. It was easy to imagine how the city looked when it was inhabited when walking around. Since",
          "We went to Perge with a tour which included a visit to Aspendos and Kursunlu waterfall. Perge was amazing, we had a english and german speaking tour guide who gave us a great informative tour of the area. This attraction is a must see if you are in Antalya and I would highly",
          "We arrived not knowing what to expect, and found ourselves amazed by the access to walk in, touch, and truly explore this ancient open-air museum. We were there for hours and didn't see another tourist.",
          "This is a huge and well preserved site, and there is still work going on to unearth other parts of it. One is just strolling through history! There are long streets with columns, thermae, a market place and plenty of interesting ruins to see. Impressive! Really worth a visit.",
          "we went on a combined trip including a visit to aspendos and Kursunlu falls which was a good day out. Perge has a fairly intact stadium and a nice overview of the city as it would have been.",
          "Let me start with getting to Perge. After some research, our option was the number 07 bus from Lara Beach to Antalya. Then to tram to Asku1. You need to buy a prepaid travel card available from some local shops but we got one from the bus driver. The cards can be topped up",
          "It was mesmerizing to wander through these majestic ruins. There were hardly any visitors on a weekday, which gave us the opportunity to enjoy the solitude and imagine the past. Refreshments were available and appreciated.",
          "New entrance since our last visit in 2015. Same great site. As we had a car this time we were able to see the whole site in just under 3 hours. The tour we were on last time gave us under an hour so we only got to see the central part. Worth every minute there.",
          "The site is very well kept and you can feel that there once were a magnificat city here... The stadium is especially impressive, but you will probably need a guide for your visit, to get the most of it.",
          "Was quite unprepared for the extent and beauty of this ancient city. The amphitheatre is off limits at the moment. However, the very intact stadium makes up for that (and Aspendos is \"down the road\"). Columned streets, evidence of elaborate water channels and fountains,",
          "This ancient city is really worth a visit. It has been really well preserved and gives a great insight into an ancient civilisation.",
          "Visiting the ancient site of Perge, a lot to see and as we were there early (10.00am) we had it all to ourselves - wonderful.",
          "The Perge ruins are surprising large, with more items being found all the time. As an American, I am actually surprised at just how much you can touch and see while still being an active archaeological dig site. So every visit might even be a little different. Being able to see",
          "Didnt know what to expect from just catching a glimpse of the sign post for Perge when looking for somewhere to visit on a rainy day. Was totally surprised at the extent of the preservation and excavation that has taken place in this out of the way place. There is loads to see,",
          "I came here for a few hours with my fiance as part of our pre-wedding honeymoon to Turkey. We walked through the ancient Greek and Roman city and looking at the ruins, it was easy to imagine how people lived there. There were the Roman baths, Nymphaeum and ruins of the",
          "dear friends, pls go and check this place. so amazing to feel how people live thousands years a go. also you may find very special statue in Antalya Museum pls check as well. you need to rent a car or find tours to Perge. however if you like history i recommend.",
          "This site is an easy trip out from Antalya. which is where our cruise docked. We decided to share the cost of a minibus with four other couples and it came to about 20 euros each. The trip out took a little under half hour and was pleasant in and of itself. However there were a",
          "Alpay the guide was brilliant! Very interesting history. the day wasn't too long and the weather was perfect.",
          "The site is vast and excavation is ongoing. I saw more Roman remains here than I did in Rome! Admittedly the treasures of Perge are mostly on display in the beautiful museum in Antalya, but this where they originated and belong. The artistry in the stone pillars, canals,",
          "I was just blown away by the beauty of this site. You can still see pieces of old pottery around the place.",
          "Only 20% of this city can be seen, the rest is under ground still. This sounds like you can see little, but the area is very big. It is great to really see how the city looked at that time. It is recommended to visit it with a guide, so you can get all the information.",
          "Perge is a truly impressive archeological site with building that still show a lot of intact features. Must see for people interested in cultural heritage of Turkey and the classic period!",
          "This is great place to visit when you are near Antalya, Turkey. Very interesting and you can make amazing pictures.",
          "It's still obvious that Perge once was a big and important city in this region. All in all it's an impressive site.",
          "The ruins are amazing, the place is fascinating, If you visit Antalya Perge should be a must go location.",
          "We were quite upset at first because we found out that the amphitheater is closed, and we were still charged a full admission fee of TL 25.00 per person. The view that greeted us at first really did not seem that attractive, after having visited Aspendos and Side. There was no",
          "You will get see some excellent roman ruins up close well worth the visit the tour guide is very knowledgeable.",
          "The day we travelled it rained off and on but this didn't detract from this interesting site. We booked the trip with the Thomson rep but the guide was from a local firm. She was outstanding and made the whole place come alive again. You really need to go with a knowledgable",
          "Enjoyed the ride there and walking around the ruins was pleasant.Did buy some trinkets from the vendors and from the gift shop at reasonable prices",
          "Perge can be visited by getting the tram to Meydan and then getting the AC03 Aksu bus from where the tram stops. The bus costs 2TL and the tram less than that. The bus continues past Asku so you will have to get off at the correct place. Then walk northwards for about 20 minutes",
          "Definitely worth a visit when you are in Antalya. If you enjoy historical stuff and a wee bit of ruins and rubble like us!",
          "Visited here in December and we were the only people there. A real shame for what are spectacular ancient ruins. It was not expensive to get in - approx 8 pounds each. Got a taxi from the hotel - return trip about 30 pounds for 4 people.",
          "It is very easy to find location! It is an absolute beautiful site. We enjoyed walking around for a couple hours! There isn't much information about the history, so you need to read about that before you go.",
          "Went on a Trip with our Tour group and found the Ruins at Perge fascinating, Amazing how they moved there water from up the hill, down to the village and baths, you need a good hour to get round this but its well worth the journey. Most of the statues from here have been moved",
          "We visited this as part of a group on an organised tour. It is a fabulous place and having a guide the history was brought alive. I would thoroughly recommend a visit.",
          "A pretty site which makes you think how much it was all civilized long time ago. Make sure you've a good guide to explain you better so you can make most of it . Recommended !",
          "Not to be missed. Went here the guides tell u so much and you learn loads. Great place to go. If this is your kind of thing.",
          "We took a package trip which included perge it was amazing our tour rep was very knowledgeable and seemed to enjoy talking about it well worth a visit",
          "Take all the way to see the theater and it was closed, but the ruins of the ancient city is still holding the main structure, they removed all the statues to Antalya museum so don't forget to check them out",
          "If history, settlements and architecture are of your interest, this is the place for you. Amazing to see how developped society was at those times.",
          "Coming from the direction of Side we found no signs to this place of Perge we even looked up the Turkish word used today to no avail. We then ended up talking a brown sign to waterfalls found a driver of an excursion he said that's my next stop follow me! We both agreed we",
          "Well worth a visit. You need a good half day to see everything. Don't go when it's hot weather. There is very little shade. There are guides available on site if you want more information.",
          "Beautiful! I had the opportunity to enjoy the heritage site with lightening in the sky. Made the ruins come to life! I do advice on wearing good shoes. As some areas are a bit unsafe to walk on with open shoes or high heels. Also, don't expect to eat at the location. It's best",
          "Extensive Romano Byzantine site. Impressive scale and remaing architecture especially the water features through the agoras. Unfortunately the amphitheatre was cordoned off when we visited.",
          "One of the best Roman ruins I have ever visited. emblematic of the Roman presence in southern and western Turkey",
          "An ancient site that has lots to see, especially if you have a good imagination to see in your head what it looked like all those years ago. The way the ancients used and built water courses is amazing. Avoid all the woman selling there normal rubbish in the car park, there are",
          "We went on an organised excursion. There was loads of history and our guide was very knowledgeable. It was a pleasant walk round.",
          "If you love history- this is amazing. Seeing the ruins and what is left standing after thousands of years is just unbelievable. Make sure to good walking shoes",
          "The ruins are well preserved and well worth a visit. Interesting to see how they heated the water in the baths and the river running through the center is very neat. I don't know how all of these arches are still standing after a few thousand years.",
          "If you are a History Buff you will love Perge. When visiting you can imagine what it was like in in its Hayday. From the relaxing in the Baths to the busyness of the market. Sadly we saw it whilst on a day tour, so were unable to stay as long as we would have liked. But will",
          "Located just 5-6 kms from highway, Entry fee 20TL, Recent Archaeological discovery... You can see the historical ruins and enjoy. I liked it very much and took snaps with family.",
          "Amazing experience. Megapolis in which you feel like a traveler in the past tense. Want to take more time to be all rich.",
          "The layout of a great ancient city is gradually reveiled as you stroll through millenary streets. The amount of findings is amazing for such a large archaelogical site, and works continues all the time, so new features may be seen in the near future. If you like ancient history",
          "Many different types of structures can be visited. Unfortunately the roman theatre was closed for safety reasons. Hope it will be open for others soon.",
          "History at its best. We had a wonderful guide who obviously knew his stuff. It's a must if you visit here. Best done via trip.",
          "Good for historians lots of pillars and still being put together. Excellent for history buffs - interesting for others.",
          "The history here is so fascinating! They continue to unearth more and more of the city and what they find is stunning! So much to see and learn. Definitely get the book from the gift shop before entering the site. It helped immensely and it has so much insight as to the way the",
          "It's the right place to be lost in time. The ruins are very well preserved. It\u00b4s a big site and you must dedicate a good amount of time. You won't regret it.",
          "Unexpectedly interesting ancient city built under the Romans and Alexander the Great. Baths, gates and towers. Best undertaken with a guide who can give perspective and orientation to what you are seeing as there are few signs.",
          "it is so good and different from routing tourist places..sheer history and archaeology every bit....",
          "Perge offers some fantastic well preserved roman era ruins. From the entrance to the city, to the school, the baths, the main street and shopping/market area. Truly amazing after all this time",
          "Perge is amazing, and they actually attempt to provide some information on the history of Perge and what you are looking at. I would have given it five stars but the theatre was closed for restoration - although no work appeared to be going on. The baths and the use of water",
          "Ancient roman city ruins, very well preserved. Excellent explanation about the city's life from the tour guide.",
          "Paul the Apostle was in Perge on his third journey. The remnants of the city is still worth a visit. Extensive excavations are going on, so that more parts of the city will be accessible. Good and informative signs adds to the experience.",
          "...in order to see fabulous statuary, a site with excavation in progress but well underway, Theusuem is good at interpreting finds, and has rescued the artifacts from certain looting. We would love to see this place again, several times, just to see how the excavations turn out.",
          "This is a great place to visit. Very open, not too busy and great ruins to walk among. We went with a tour guide and had an excellent experience.",
          "Awe inspiring, a highlight of a weeks break booked at the last minute. We were accosted by a local who tried to sell us 'ancient coins' that he had 'found' on the site. Husband told him he should keep the for his grandchildren as they could be worth a lot lol! However he did",
          "So Interesting and fascinating place to visit! Just take a hat and some extra water with you because it gets quite hot. Good place to visit before noon so it wont get too hot.",
          "great for history buffs but you have to walk long distances inside, a little away from town so take time out to visit this one",
          "What an amazing site. Great pictures and lots to see. You can spend three quarters of a day here easily. Take your time and explore.",
          "To get here from Kaleici take the new tram from north corner of kaleici or walk up Ali Cetinkaya Cd. It takes about 20 mins to Meydan. Continue on to ali Centinkaya Cd and at the first bus stop take any bus to Aksu. We took AF04 @10:30 am. It take about 45 mins to reach Aksu.",
          "Prior to our visit to Perge I really did not know much about it. The site is very extensive and archeological work is still being done at the site. It will be decades before full restoration is completed. It would be helpful to have a guide take you around the site to best",
          "This is a vast area of ruins some of which are in reasonable shape but others are just a tumble of rocks, but worth seeing just the same.",
          "Huge Roman bath. Amazing how they managed to heat the bath. The Agora was huge. It was fascinating to see how they channeled the water down the main street, build overpasses over the water channel. The city centre was much bigger than what I was expecting. The only problem",

          "Very close to Antalya and costs 20 TL to get in. Some very old ruins and a huge site to explore. I'd recommend downloading an audio guide or hiring a tour guide to get the most out of it. Still very interesting and great to clamber around structures dating 2000+ years!",
          "Great place to spend a few hours and soak up the history of the ancient times. Easy to get to for a visit",
          "This Hellenistic/Roman archeological site is located a few miles away from the city of Antalya. It boasts 2 amphiteaters at the entrance of the site; a typical circular one and an elongated one, both fairly well preserved. The old city counts north and southern baths as well",
          "We booked a trip through thomas cook and this also included a few hours at aspendos and a beautiful waterfall. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and helpful and perge was a site to be seen. We also bought a guide book that shows you pictures of was it potentially work have",
          "there are a lot of archeological sites in Turkey. this is highly recommended but do your research to make it more interesting or get a guide or do a tour. We did this with a visit to Aspendos as well.Because it's so open, you must wear a hat as the sun can be scorching and allow",
          "It's a very big archaeological site, with lots of ruins and magnificent columns. It well worth the visit, especially if you complement it with a visit to the Antalya Museum where many of Perge's sculptures are.",
          "This is a great historical site full of great heritage and stories to tell. It's failry cheap to enter and you can even buy a pass for Aspendos Theatre at the same time. However you will only waste your time looking at bricks and rocks of ruins unless a professional guide is",
          "Must see for any enthusiast of Ancient World, as it is one of the larger and better preserved Archeological parks in Turkey. Definitely on the best attractions of such nature in all of the Mediterranean region of Asia Minor. Also, work in progress. Significant excavation and",
          "Located close to Antalya, Perge has large area of ruins with preserved theatre which were not accessible as well as stadium. Worth a visit. Didnt have long to walk around unfortunately but good for an hour or two if you like this sort of thing.",

          "For those who are thinking of an informative trip to amazing places this is for you. My girlfriend and I were sceptical about this trip thinking it would be a bit boring, all the time waiting to go back to the hotel. HOW WRONG WERE WE. Absolutely amazing places and the tour",
          "very interesting place. It must have been magnificent in its full pomp. Well worth a visit. Note excavations are still ongoing... it could only happen in Turkey.",
          "Astonishing place, make you wonder how they managed to build such wonderfull cities, but be warned, ensure you're well protected from the sun as it can get blisteringly hot, highly recommended.",
          "The ruin is very well preserved. Like any other ruin from the past, i suggest that you get a tour guide to explain n narrate the history of each segment of the site. Otherwise what you see is only amazing ruin without the history behind it.",
          "the archeological monument was huge,it tells much on the history of antalya,our guide was very helpfull.",
          "Went there by 5:30. No one was there. They closed at 7PM (summer schedule). We had the whole site by ourselves! What a experience. I would definitely recommend going there after busy hours.",
          "Outstanding. Be sure you guide does this first, as you will go way back to do this the next day. Terrific.",

          "Unfortunately this was one of 3 place we visited on a day tour out of Antalya. This meant we only had just over an hour here and only in the town centre. Next time we will rent a car and spend the whole day here, but only after reading more of its history. Very well preserved",
          "Impressive remains of a Roman town, with many sections well preserved. Now that Palmyra in Syria is inaccessible (and tragically partially destroyed) one of the best remaining examples of Roman-style city planning (Palmyra is, of course, Nabatean).",
          "The old city of Perge with its Hellenic and Roman ruins offers a truly magnificient insight to life in this place through times. With a good guide, you'll discover the stories behind the many ruins including the towers, baths, canal and market.",
          "If you find yourself in a resort in Belek, there is very little sight-seeing to do without having to be in the bus for 3-4 hours. A trip to Perge was the right time to spend getting steeped in history without too much arduous bus travel. Do go with a guide, they are genuinely",
          "we love this place so much especially when the tourist guide tells us a lot about the history without overwhelming details. he is very friendly and showed us good spots for taking pictures, and also let us have fun by ourselves at the end",
          "Visited as part of a half day trip arranged via TUI. What a gem of a site. The ruins are quite impressive and we had a wonderful guide that really brought its story to life. It seems that not many people visit, which is a great shame, although was wonderful for me as I got to",

          "A huge site, only partly excavated but still plenty to see. It helps to have a good tour guide, as with all these ancient sites.",
          "Much bigger and interesting than what we thought it would be, Turks are not the best at looking after these sites and have some horrible attempts to repair but aside of that Perge is well worth a visit",
          "This was better than Ephesus! Its that well preserved. Not so many tourists, this place blew us away as we wondered the ancient streets and thought of the antiquitus years... Bring water, sunscreen and a hat, take the trek up the Acropolis and see excavations in progress...!",
          "Perge is vast - but being Turkey, is still very much under-explored and underfunded so there is no doubt much left to discover. Some tours don't allow enough time here and the stadium and theatre were not accessible due to ongoing archaelogical work. Avoid the heat of the day -",
          "It is always good to see some of the history of a country and this is a great example. As you walk around you can actually imagine what this must have been like as a bustling city. If you are in the area it is a great day out.",

          "I loved my trip around these amazing ruins, the guides are very informative and keep the fun to keep those of all ages entertained. Only tip I would give is make sure you take plenty of water as it is quite a long tour and avoid it in summer months, August 50 degrees was far",

          "beautiful, i don't think i have seen a Roman city so well preserved. you could almost picture life back then as most of the structures are still there and combined with the Antalya Museum, you get a pretty good picture of Pergia in those days :) also the artefacts in the museum",
          "I know it's not Ephesos but Perge must have been a very busy place in its heyday. First Greek and then Roman it's obvious that there was serious enterprise taking place here. The proof is the amount of great marble sculptures filling the Antalya Museum.",
          "It is a wonder how the romans built this such a long time ago and how some is still standing. Amazing to see how they used to live. I am happy that we went here with out a guide - as we had the freedom to roam around as we pleased. Unfortunately the amphitheatre was closed off",
          "Good advice : if you have a drink at the entrance before you go in, they give you a map of the site for free (normal price 5TLR). We went to Perge by car and arrived in the late afternoon so it was very peaceful and quiet. We enjoyed a stroll between the ruins. It is not Pompe\u00ef",
          "This is a spectacular Greco-Roman city. It is very interesting to walk the site and see how the Romans expanded the city from the original Greek core. The Roman bath was particularly interesting to see how the water was heated and moved through the bath. Movement of water -",
          "Perge is one of the best archeological sites in Turkey (and maybe the world). Large parts of the old town are still visible - and you can see it once was a very important city. Do take a guided tour, so you hear more about the history and culture.",
          "Our guide was excellent in providing an understanding of this ancient city and its ruins. There was plenty to see and experience.",
          "we were very lucky to basically have the ruins to ourselves being out of season defiantly worth a trip",
          "We loved Perge , one of our best place found in Antalya area, the main road in marble with all columns just send you in the past, it is a nice place and for me really impressive.",
          "I went there in April and the sunshine was burning us, so I don't recommend this place in hot summer days, unless you bring sun-hat and/or put on sun cream. The whole area is well-preserved, although it's undergoing some restorations, so some places might be closed. The entrance",
          "I saw a number of ruins in Turkey, and these were among some of the best, though not the best. The area is quite large and gives you a number of structures to view. I recommend either doing research first or traveling with a guide, so you understand what you are seeing - that",
          "I was impressed by the archeology of these two cities. I visited the ciry but unfortunately, I was not allowed to visit the Historic Amphitheatre in Aspendos and Perge as they were under restoration. I found out that Perge , for a long time ago, used to be a part of Lydia",
          "This experience and all the hard work put into the excavation is just simply amazing. I would like to visit 25 years from now to see how much more there will be. This visit is a must if visiting nearby.",
          "The city of Perge (the ruins that is) is a must to see when visiting Turkey. It's only a few kilometers from the Antalya airport, and very well marked if you are driving yourself. The size will blow you away - and what you see puts Rome to shame when you really think about it.",
          "I can imagine when finished Perge will give Ephuses a run for it's money. As it is it's only half unearthed but is still epic. Must be seen in congestion with the museum in Antalya where the important statuarty resides for safety sake. The workmen are still excavation and unlike",
          "Few minutes from Antalya, ancient city of Perge. Entrance 15 lira, opened every day from 9:00 till 17:00. To visit a place you will need at least 1 hour. Agora, hammam - it is good idea to read a little bit about the place before as the information inside the city is really poor.",
          "Astonishing to think that if it were as thoroughly excavated, Perge might well rival Ephesus in size and scope. As it is now, you have to use your imagination, at least until you see the pieces in the Antalya museum",
          "Perge was the capital city of Pamphilia Union which was the old name of Antalya. when l visited there l saw the second biggest stadium in anatolia, Huge Columns, best preserved roman bathes, statue of river's God, agora of the city. Especiall underground water pipes and colorful",
          "This is a well excavated ruin. I recommend visiting the Antalya Museum before visiting so that you can picture where the statues were and imagine the opulence of the city during the Roman times. At the time we visited the theater was under renovations and not open. Take time to",

          "Firstly, this site is more expensive than Termessos, Duden etc. Those were 2.5 and 5 liras to get in and here it's 15 liras. It's a huge site and at the time we couldn't access the theatre but we went once on our own and once as part of a hotel day tour. It was worth going on",
          "We headed to Perge in October and were really surprised at how big the site was - much bigger than we expected from the description given when booking! There is so much to see and upon arrival you can really get a sense of living in this, one of the largest, Roman cities in",
          "The great thing about Perge is you can see how all the buildings fitted together. you can almost sense the bustle that would have existed on the main street. It is touristy and does attract the bus loads, but it is spacious enough to cope! 15TL seemed a fair price for all",

          "A wonderful ancient ruin not far from Antalya. The tour my partner and I took (Nirvana) did not give us nearly enough time to adequately explore the ruins. Such a shame the theatre is closed to the public because from the pictures it seems to rival Aspendos!",
          "Incredible to stand in the Agora and try to imagine what going to the market would have been like thousands of years ago. Also incredible to think of how much marble they used. Had a great guide, but some of the other tour groups were kind of rude-it would have been nice if",

          "Some areas closed due to excavation, including the amphitheatre. Still worth a visit though as it's big enough. Have a small bottle of water with you as you walk around. A fair few tour groups so if you can get a hire car and arrive early it'd be quieter. Give yourself at",
          "We visited Perge along with Aspendos and Side on a day tour with Nirvana tours which you can book locally in Antalya or online. The guide was great and it was excellent value for money",

          "The bath complex was amazing. Those Romans new how to live. There is still so much at this site to be dug up and restored. I expect many great things will come out of this site as archeologists continue to work the site.",
          "It is quite easy to imagine how life was lived in this city. The collanaded street with centre water feature and the Agora with its surrounding shops were interesting. Sites were well explained.",
          "A lot to see (and quickly if you go with a coach tour!). Can't believe how much still remains here. We saw it as well as Side and Aspendos on an organised coach tour, we would have liked more time to explore, say 1-2 hours. I would also have liked to look at the stadium in more",

          "Perge is very impressive little city located a few km from Antalya. It's very easy to get there by car ( but I am sure that also by buses) as it's just of the highway. Impressive ruins where you can walk in the old street see the shops were in the Agora area and the big baths.",
          "Another great place to wander & explore. Truly amazing place, the Romans & Greeks were so clever, just marvel at all that has been excavated. So many columns, walls, pillars, and still alot of work left to do. We enjoyed it so much.",

          "We just visited Perge, about 2km beyond Antalya's airport by car. It is a site that should not be missed while in Antalya. A great experience of seeing how this important city of Pamphylia was built and then restored by the Romans. You can easily spend 2hrs here. There are",
          "very interesting, a must see historical place if you are in Antalya. It is better to see this place with just a driver and not those organized tours as you wouldnt have time to take pictures. We did hire someone who drove us to the places we wanted to see, just me and my family",
          "We travelled by ourselves to this, the size of the ruins is immense. Think we would have got more out of the trip with a guide, but even so it was well worth the visit.",

          "Having seen Ephesus, we weren't sure there would be anything new another ruins site could offer, but Perge pleasantly surprised us. So much to see -- breathtaking vistas -- and there are plenty of signs in competently translated English to make it easy to absorb what one is",
          "Many, many things to see in Perge. Watching the transition from Greek to Roman city. Long columned streets, the agora, the gates, it's all here.",

          "We have visited many ancient sites, and this one stacks up nicely with most of them. Strong points: carefully excavated and well-signed in English, lots to see, unrestricted access to everything in the site, relatively few other tourists when we went. Weak areas: no tour",
          "world-famous ancient Greco-Roman theater of Aspendos, Perge, was one of the most important and beautiful ancient cities along the coast we were told. The apostle St.Paul preached here during his missionary journey and Perge is also known for being the birthplace of the famous",

          "This big Roman ruin city is comparable to Efesos and is still under excavation, so it grows by the day. Lots of daytrips go here, and it was perhaps the cultural highlight of our week in Antalya. Book a guided trip and experience it!",

          "If you have little time, choose to visit Aspendos rather than Perg\u00e9. However, Perg\u00e9 is interesting as well. Note that the theater in Perg\u00e9 cannot be visited as it threatens to collapse, which is a bit frustrating.",
          "Well worth the visit to see such incredible ruins. Perge is definitely a little off the beaten path but once we got there it was worth the trip.",
          "We visited off season and had Perge almost to ourselves. This is relatively undeveloped, and you can explore the city as you like, discovering surprises and interesting things around every turn. The ruins of the baths are fantastic, and the main road with the water channel",

          "Agora, collonaded street, bath-house,stadium and nymphaeum all splendid. Only a short walk up the road from Aksu village where the minibus from Antalya drops you. Theatre and palaestra unfortunately currently closed for restoration.",
          "Brilliant day out, excellent lesson from our tour guide, enjoyed the ruins a lot. Even my girlfriend who isn't into this at all enjoyed walking around the ruins and learning about it all",

          "A ancient roman settlement, still mainly intact. The town can be walked through and around. For us the best part were the old baths, but the forum and the main street came close. There are archways, a fountainand a ground level aquaduct worth seeing. Outside the main town is a",
          "The ruins are so vast and you can walk into each site and touch and feel how it was in 1275 BC. Many of the ruins are still intact and they are restoring the site every day. This is a massive site and well worth the visit.",

          "Perge is fascinating and full of interesting stories but ... among all of the other monuments surrounding Antalya it is the least \"grandiose\".",
          "One of the best - if not THE best - preserved Roman stadiums in the world. The Agora (marketplace) is fascinating, and the Roman baths should not be missed. Highly recommended!",

          "I visited Perge as part of a tour group. We were only there for around an hour, and that is definitely not enough time to see the whole site! The ruins are amazingly broad in scope, and very few areas are off-limits for current excavations. I highly recommend not visiting",
          "Well worth seeing. But don't miss Pharselus, as that is probably even better. Abandoned Greek town to the S.W. Olympus is good for a laugh too - it has been taken over by a hippy commune.",
          "So full of history and beautiful relics it's amazing",

          "Honestly, Perge is a good place. But the day I went in, there was a movie that was being shot (and guess what, it was a bollywood movie). I greeted the actors but that wasnt really my objective to visit Perge. When I went in, I saw some set that was being made where the movie",
          "Its easy to get to by bus from the otogar. Get a bus to Aksu then its a 10 min walk. The amphitheatre was closed for conservation but looked great as did the stadium. The two towers at the entrance are really spectacular. The baths are very well preserved. Its quite a big site",
          "If you like history then Perge is definitely worth seeing. It is a vast site dating back to the Roman era. You do need some imagination to recreate what was once clearly an amazing city, but it's a fascinating place.",
          "i saw many ruins but here is a real city with agora, hammams, central heating system in living places, waterways and theatre... everyone must see...",

          "Definitely worth visiting if you enjoy history. Not too happy with staff. They closed shop/Caffe  etc around 5 even though the place closes at 5:30. Basically stood at the gates waiting for us to leave. Also note the theatre has a separate entrance across the road.  Awesome place just need more enthusiastic staff.",
          "Give Perga another 10 years of excavation, it will rival some of the great early Roman cities to view, especially once the stadium & theater works are complete. A real jem of the future. Hint, look for some early Christian signs, it's a great treasure hunt.",
          "Captivating ruins, even in the hot sun. We spent about two hours in 43 degree temperatures looking at the various Perga ruins. The engravings on some of the architecture are fascinating. The site is easy enough to find. FYI: There\u2019s little shade, so be sure to take some sun protection.",

        "wiki": "Antalya (Turkish pronunciation: [an\u02c8talja]) is the fifth-most populous city in Turkey and the capital of Antalya Province. Located on Anatolia's southwest coast bordered by the Taurus Mountains, Antalya is the largest Turkish city on the Mediterranean coast outside the Aegean region with over one million people in its metropolitan area.The city that is now Antalya was first settled around 200 BC by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon, which was soon subdued by the Romans. Roman rule saw Antalya thrive, including the construction of several new monuments, such as Hadrian's Gate, and the proliferation of neighboring cities. The city has changed hands several times, including to the Seljuk Sultanate in 1207 and an expanding Ottoman Empire in 1391. Ottoman rule brought relative peace and stability for the next five hundred years. The city was transferred to Italian suzerainty in the aftermath of World War I, but was recaptured by a newly independent Turkey in the War of Independence.\nAntalya is Turkey's biggest international sea resort, located on the Turkish Riviera. Large-scale development and governmental funding has promoted tourism. A record 12.5 million tourists passed through the city in 2014.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city was founded as \"Attaleia\" (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), named after its founder Attalos II, king of Pergamon. This name, still in use in Greek, was later evolved in Turkish as Adalia and then Antalya. Attaleia was also the name of a festival at Delphi and Attalis (Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c2) was the name of an old Greek tribe at Athens.  Despite the close similarity, there is no connection with the name Anatolia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKing Attalus II of Pergamon is looked on as founder of the city in about 150 BC, during the Hellenistic period. It was named Attaleia or Attalia (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) in his honour. The city served as a naval base for Attalus's powerful fleet. Excavations in 2008, in the Do\u011fu Garaj\u0131 plot, uncovered remains dating to the 3rd century BC, suggesting that Attalea was a rebuilding and expansion of an earlier town.\n\nAttalea became part of the Roman Republic in 133 BC when Attalus III, a nephew of Attalus II bequeathed his kingdom to Rome at his death in 133 BC. The city grew and prospered during the Ancient Roman period and was part of the Roman province of Pamphylia Secunda, whose capital was Perga.\nChristianity started to spread to the region even in the 1st century: Antalya was visited by Paul of Tarsus and Barnabas, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: \"Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, and from there they sailed to Antioch\". Some of the bishops attributed to the episcopal see of Attalea in Pamphylia may instead have been bishops of Attalea in Lydia (Yanantepe), since Le Quien lists them under both sees. No longer a residential bishopric, Attalea in Pamphylia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.The 13th-century Seljuk mosque at Attalea, now in ruins, had been a Christian Byzantine basilica from the 7th century. The Great Mosque had also been a Christian basilica and the Kesik Minare Mosque had been the 5th-century Christian Church of the Panaghia or Virgin and was decorated with finely carved marble. The archaeological museum at Attalia houses some sarcophagi and mosaics from nearby Perga and a casket of bones reputed to be those of St. Nicholas, the bishop of Myra, further down the Turquoise coast.\nAntalya was a major city in the Byzantine Empire. It was the capital of the Byzantine Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots, which occupied the southern coasts of Anatolia. According to the research of Speros Vryonis, it was the major naval station on the southern Anatolian coast, a major commercial center, and the most convenient harbor between the Aegean Sea and Cyprus and points further east. Besides the local merchants, \"one could expect to see Armenians, Saracens, Jews, and Italians.\"At the time of the accession of John II Comnenus in 1118 Antalya was an isolated outpost surrounded by Turkish beyliks, accessible only by sea. Following the fall of Constantinople in 1204, Niketas Choniates records that one Aldebrandus, \"an Italian by birth who was strictly raised according to Roman tradition\" controlled Antalya as his own fief. When Kaykhusraw, sultan of the Seljuk Turks attempted to capture the city in 1206, Aldebrandus sent to Cyprus for help and received 200 Latin infantry who defeated the attackers after a siege of less than 16 days. Kaykhusraw would take Antalya the following year and build its first mosque.. People of Christian were rebelled and captured Antalya with aid of Walter of Montb\u00e9liard in 1212. Briefly restored Byzantine rule in Antalya was ended by Kaykaus I in 1216.\n\nThe city and the surrounding region were conquered by the Seljuk Turks in the early 13th century. Antalya was the capital of the Turkish beylik of Teke (1321\u20131423) until its conquest by the Ottomans, except for a period of Cypriot rule between 1361 and 1373. The Arabic traveler Ibn Battuta, who visited the city in 1335\u20131340, noted:\nFrom Alanya I went to Antaliya [Adalia], a most beautiful city. It covers an immense area, and though of vast bulk is one of the most attractive towns to be seen anywhere, besides being exceedingly populous and well laid out. Each section of the inhabitants lives in a separate quarter. The Christian merchants live in a quarter of the town known as the Mina [the Port], and are surrounded by a wall, the gates of which are shut upon them from without at night and during the Friday service. The Greeks, who were its former inhabitants, live by themselves in another quarter, the Jews in another, and the king and his court and Mamluks in another, each of these quarters being walled off likewise. The rest of the Muslims live in the main city. Round the whole town and all the quarters mentioned there is another great wall. The town contains orchards and produces fine fruits, including an admirable kind of apricot, called by them Qamar ad-Din, which has a sweet almond in its kernel. This fruit is dried and exported to Egypt, where it is regarded as a great luxury.\nIn the second half of the 17th century Evliya \u00c7elebi wrote of a city of narrow streets containing 3,000 houses in 20 Turkish and four Greek neighborhoods. The town had grown beyond the city walls and the port was reported to hold up to 200 boats.\nIn the 19th century, in common with most of Anatolia, its sovereign was a \"dere bey\" (landlord or landowner). The family of Tekke O\u011flu, domiciled near Perge had been reduced to submission in 1812 by Mahmud II, but continued to be a rival power to the Ottoman governor until the early 20th century, surviving by many years the fall of the other great beys of Anatolia. The records of the Levant (Turkey) Company, which maintained an agency in Antalya until 1825, documented the local dere beys.In the early 20th century, Antalya had two factories spinning and weaving cotton. As of 1920, the factories had 15,000 spindles and over 200 looms. A German-owned mill baled cotton. There were gin mills.In the 20th century the population of Antalya increased as Turks from the Caucasus and the Balkans moved into Anatolia. The economy was centered on its port that served the inland areas, particularly Konya. Antalya (then Adalia) was picturesque rather than modern. The chief attraction for visitors was the city wall, and outside a promenade, a portion of which survives. The government offices and the houses of the higher classes were outside the walls.\n\nAs of 1920, Antalya was reported as having a population of approximately 30,000. The harbor was described as small, and unsafe for vessels to visit in the winter. Antalya was exporting wheat, flour, sesame seeds, livestock, timber and charcoal. The latter two were often exported to Egypt and other goods to Italy or other Greek islands, who received mainly flour. In 1920, the city had seven flour mills. Wheat was imported, and then processed in town before exportation. Antalya imported manufactured items, mainly from the United Kingdom.The city had a Greek minority that made up 1/3 of the population until the population exchange.Antalya also had a tiny Armenian population which had a Church on the street of\"Hamam \u00e7ikmazi\"named Hovhannes Surp Garabed,which was later on demolished.Antalya also had a Jewish community which had a tiny Synagogue in the neighborhood of Balbey and a Talmud Tora ,The Synagogue was closed in 1948 and its exact location is not known and the Synagogue might not exist anymore.The Jewish community had 2 graveyards and one was located across \"Donerciler carsisi\"and was demolished when the area was opened to construction ,But one marble tombstone belonging to a Jewish person named Raphael Moshe was transferred to the Antalya Museum where you can see the tombstone in the museums garden.\nThe city was occupied by the Italians from 28 March 1919 to 5 July 1921 during Turkish War of Independence. Large-scale development beginning in the 1970s transformed Antalya from a pastoral town into one of Turkey's largest metropolitan areas. Much of this has been due to tourism, which expanded in the 21st century. In the 1985 singing diva Dalida held her last concert in Antalya.\nAntalya was the host city for the 2015 G-20 summit and the EXPO 2016. Five countries have their consular missions in Antalya including Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Belgium and Serbia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area is shielded from the northerly winds by the Taurus Mountains. Antalya has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with hot and dry summers and mild and rainy winters. Around 300 days of the year are sunny, with nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight per year. The mean sea temperature ranges between 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in winter and 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) in summer. The highest record air temperature reached 45.4 \u00b0C (113.7 \u00b0F) on 1 July 2017 which normally averages as high as 34.4 \u00b0C (93.9 \u00b0F) and the lowest record dropped to \u22124.6 \u00b0C (23.7 \u00b0F) in February, when the low average is as low as 6.1 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the Address-Based Birth Recording System showed a metropolitan population of 1,001,318 (502,491 male; 498,827 female).

Some of these yards have advanced in composites boat building technology.\nCorendon Airlines and SunExpress are headquartered in Antalya.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDespite having architectural heritage dating back up to Hellenistic times, most historical architecture in Antalya date to the medieval Seljuk period, with a number of mosques, madrasahs, masjids, caravanserais, Turkish baths and tombs giving the city a Turkish-Islamic character. Historical architecture is concentrated in the walled city, Kalei\u00e7i; ancient structures are not well-preserved in the rest of the city of Antalya as the modern city was built on the ancient city. Kalei\u00e7i, with its narrow cobbled streets of historic Ottoman era houses, is the old center of Antalya. With its hotels, bars, clubs, restaurants, and shopping, it has been restored to retain much of its historical character. It is surrounded by two walls in the shape of a horsenail, one of which is along the seafront, built in a continuous process from Hellenistic to Ottoman times. The historical harbour is located in this part of the city; narrow streets extend from the harbour and branch off into the old city, surrounded by wooden historical houses. Cumhuriyet Square, the main square of the city and a spot very popular for tourists and locals, is surrounded by shopping and business centres and public buildings. There are sites with traces of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Seljuk architecture and cultures. There are also examples of the local Greek architecture in the city, with five Greek Orthodox churches in the old city.The walled city is surrounded by a large metropolitan area. With high rates of immigration since the 1970s, this area contains large gecekondu neighborhoods that are not well-integrated into the fabric of the city and suffer from poor economic conditions and insufficient education. Gecekondu areas are concentrated in the Kepez district, where an estimated 70% of the houses were gecekondus in 2008. In 2011, it was estimated that there were 50\u201360,000 gecekondus in Antalya, housing around 250,000 people.Antalya has beaches including Konyaalt\u0131, Lara and Karpuzkald\u0131ran.

Being the capital of the fifth most populous province in Turkey, Antalya is politically strategic and has been a target for the governing center-right Justice and Development Party (AKP). The AKP unexpectedly won control of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality in the 2004 local election. The AKP won a plurality in Antalya in the 2007 general election, symbolising the city's political transformation from a CHP stronghold to a CHP-AKP marginal battleground in the 21st century. The loss of Antalya was a major political setback for the CHP not only because of its significance as a centre for tourism, but also because the CHP's former leader Deniz Baykal is a Member of Parliament for the province. The province is divided into 19 districts.\nThe CHP regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2009 local elections, though the AKP won a plurality in the 2011 general election. The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) also have a strong political base in Antalya, winning approximately between 15 and 25% of the vote in elections since 2007. The city voted in favour of the AKP government's proposed constitutional reforms in the 2007 referendum, but voted against the reforms proposed in 2010.\nIn the 2014 local elections, Antalya once again voted for the AKP, with the MHP taking support away from the CHP by winning a record 24.3% of the vote. The CHP subsequently accused the AKP of systematic electoral fraud, and the presence of government minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu at one of the vote counting centres drew strong condemnation. In the 2014 presidential election, the CHP and MHP's joint candidate Ekmeleddin \u0130hsano\u011flu won 53.08% of the vote. The AKP's candidate Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan won 41.63% of the vote, and the HDP democratic socialist candidate Selahattin Demirta\u015f won 5.30% of the vote. Antalya was a hotspot for the 2013\u201314 anti-government protests against the AKP.The secular main opposition, CHP, regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2019 local elections.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe football club of Antalya, Antalyaspor plays in the S\u00fcper Lig.

In 2010, the city planned to increase from 40 to 140 more buses.Payment for public transportation was made in cash until the launch of a public transportation card, Antkart, in late 2007.

          "Got a taxi found the gate and walked through. Not a lot to say about a stone stand alone structure that was built in the 300\u2019s. It\u2019s not very well preserved and doesn\u2019t appear to be cared for. The walk through the old town was interesting though.",
          "Luckily our hotel was a 5 minute walk from this attraction, I would have been majorly dissapointed if i traveled to see Hadrians Gate. The gate itself is full of character and i can appreciate its history, however what you see in the image is literally all you'll see in",

          "Must visit site. Great photo opportunities and a magnificent piece of history and the gateway to Kaleici. Not to be missed.",
          "Hadrian's gate and the OldTown entrance are definitely worth the visit. If you're staying on the Lara Hotel strip, you simply need to take the LC07 and then the KC06 if I remember correctly. The oldtown is worth the visit just for the history alone. The local Turkish community",
          "We walked down Ataturk Boulevard to see the not to be missed Hadrians Gate. It's a beautiful piece of history and one of the entances into the Kaleici. Definitely worth it",
          "I was mesmerised. Fantastic it's still standing and in reasonably good nick. Amazing what those folks built all those years ago without computers, CAD, Google etc. Go and see it.",

          "Once you enter the gate, you will find yourself in a whole different area of Antalya where you'll find a lotttt of small boutiques, souvenir shops, small cafeterias, ateliers, the port and the beach of course! The gate is bigger than it looks like in pictures and can be used as",
          "The well known entrance to old town is well worth a visit. In amazing condition considering it's age, it leads to the maze-like narrow streets of the upper levels of the original town. Fascinated by the excavated central arch where centuries of wheeled traffic have left deep",

          "Depending on how you enter the old town Hadrians gate is a good start or end point to the visit of the old town... picture moments galore. Glad it\u2019s a structure that has been preserved",
          "This gate is located in the historic part of the city and is actually at the moment like the entrance to the helmet It has a completely Romanic architecture and reminds of the majesty of the Roman Empire",
          "a well visited historical place, well maintained and looked after, you can still get a sense of what it must of been like in a time gone by.",

          "We took an early morning walk in the old city and got great photos of this monument and it is well worth visiting with no entrance fee. You can do it while shopping on the main streets next to it. It can get busy during the day so try to go early in the morning.",

          "We had a trip round Antalya organised but TUI and it was worth the money. There is a lot of history and it's worth to hear it.",
          "I found the walk from the gate into the hill which overlooks the old harbour quite pleasant. Lots of small sweet shops and restaurants as you walk along. At the end of Ale\u00e8 you would find a large yard where people stop for a treat or to take pictures. Well worth a visit if you",
          "Hadrians Gate is good to see as it is free, Nothing special but always good to see. Located in the town centre of antalya, head up behind hadrians Gate as there are lots off wee shops and resurants.",

          "My hotel was very close to this wonderful triple gate and I walked past and under it everday, and I admired its details as you surely will when you visit whether during the daytime or after dark. You will notice the floor in the center gate is deeply pitted due to wheels of",
          "It's one of those 'must go' places in Antalya. We went there by tram from Antalya musuam, it was free ride somehow. After tram we walked 5mins to Hadrian's gate, easy to find with Google map. Very small building, few pics and we left. It can gets really packed and you have",
          "Magnificent piece of Roman architecture. Walk down to the harbour and come back up in the free lift at the other end of the harbour.",
          "A must see site. Steeped in history and very close to the town centre. Many tours start from near here.",
          "If someone would ask Should I go 20km so see Hadrian's gate. I would say no! :) But it's really worth to make few extra miles to see it and for me it's more a gates to the beautiful Antalya's Old Town! It's not worth to travel special for Hardian's Gate, but if you are near",
          "One of the nicest gates into the old town, but always crowded, no matter what! There are good restaurants nearby!",
          "The gate is the entrance to the lovely old town where you can visit lovely cafes and restaurants. Wandering through the narrow streets was very charming.",

          "Always amazing to see something still standing from 130 AD. It had a nice patina, not super cleaned up like similar sites in Europe.",
          "what a remarkable achievement for this piece of history still standing today,but what makes it better is when you see the wheel ruts from the past that can never be ignored that tells you more about the history than when you got it in school",
          "We were on our way to our cruise to see the falls and rock formations and went thru this gate to get there. It is a great way to enter the myriad of winding streets, residences and hotels here. Very few of these were open as we were very early. Our guide told us that taking",

          "This place very close to city center. And first approaching place to old city, very historic and good for photo and memories. After visit to Hadrian and old city you may visit coffee shops on I\u015f\u0131klar street",
          "By coming early (before noon) I was able to brows in peace and quiet. If you consider just how many people come through here every day it is a miracle that this place is as well preserved as it is. Small but absolutely worth seeing.",
          "An amazing place with long history place in the centre of Antalya. Quite good place for a meeting point..",
          "Great experience to be walk\u015fng through those gates. I didn't see a sign to explain when and why the gate was built, but there's always google. Be careful to not slip when walking through the middle gate.",
          "This historical gate is located in center of the city can easily be reached by bus or by walk from city center. Behind that you can visit the beautiful old town of kaleichi. This will really refresh your mind, as you will reach the beach walking by old town",

          "A beautiful historic place to see right in the heart of Antalya. It\u2019s a must if you are in to historical places.",
          "And a great monument of Antalya. One should never leave the city without seeing this beautiful heritage",
          "this is the main entrance to the old town on foot well worth a visit you can see the ruts left by thousands of cart wheels etc on the stones under foot and takes you into a wee gem of a place to be able to look at the way life was all that time ago when horse and cart was the",
          "This gate was one of the first things I wanted to see and 'feel' when visitting Antalya. I guess it's something what depends on your interests, I've enjoyed everytime I passed by the gate. The location is very public and central, you don't have to travel specially to see it.",
          "This is a must see and an integral part of Antalya\u2019s history. Unfortunately the glass footbridge shown in the photo has now been removed and exposed the centuries old chariot/cart ruts. The elderly should take great care especially if it has been raining.",
          "Not much to see, some people might like it if they know about culture but as a structure is pretty but that\u2019s it. Still, it\u2019s one of the landmarks on downtown and a must if walking there",
          "It is nice old historic gate which opens to the old town of Antalya. It is beautifully carved . I must do when in Antalya.",
          "Got a local bus from our hotel and got off here to start a magnificent day out in the old town...great bars and restaurants nearby and every shop imaginable.... awesome.",
          "Hadrian Gate is one of entry point for old town and this can get crowded. Lot of small shops around the place makes this place loss its charm. Structure of the gate it self is good to see but again this is not huge. I will suggest to visit early in the morning or late eve for",
          "Lovely to see the old ruins of the city and take a ramble round the little streets and bazaars ending at the harbour wall which had amazing views. Coffee houses, restaurants and bars to help refresh your thirst.",
          "Y\u00fcr\u00fcy\u00fc\u015f yolu boyunca de\u011fi\u015fik g\u00fczel mekanlar var, kesinlikle tavsiye ediyorum. G\u00fczel bir ak\u015fam ge\u00e7irmek i\u00e7in ideal. Nice Restaurants, pubs, live music in some of them. Recommend Bavarian, two guys playing guitar, best of 70's 80's",
          "I was slightly disappointed in this attraction. From the previous reviews I expected something spectacular so I felt a bit let down when I saw it. It clearly has an important place in the history of Antalya and is a wonderful piece of architecture but there is not enough about",
          "This gate is obviously very old and is quite interesting, but it's one of many similar ruins that we've seen and not worth a special trip to see it. We walked through it and it has character, but I wouldn't visit just for this.",
          "It is one of the significant symbols of Antalya. Imagine you are travelling back to those years. See it daytime and night time. Enjoy your walk to the old town, kaleici.",
          "But it\u2019s built for an Emperor, and hence is worth some contemplation. It is the ceremonial entrance point to Kaleici and a popular photo spot for tourists",
          "Nothing noteworthy. Snap a couple of photos or download off the internet and check it off your list.",
          "Walking in Antalya you always have a chance to meet ancient art. Tourist from all over the world are coming to stay at the Hadrian's Gate.",
          "This is one of the main entrances to the old town and those staying in Kaleici will see it at some time or another without a special trip. Fairly impressive, structure but has a bar right next to it so don't expect to much. Good photo opportunity",
          "Majestic Roman era structure that adds to the historical feel of Old Town. If you are a history lover do check it out.",
          "Tie this in with a lengthy stroll around old quarter, and a trip to the Marina. Whilst it is a stark landmark in the old quarter and is steeped in history, I can\u2019t see people spending more than 15 minutes looking at it.",
          "It's a lovely pleasant walk, especially in the evening when the lights are on, making it very atmospheric.",
          "Wonderful ancient historic site... Understated and almost missed if you are passing through without knowledge of its presence. I guess Turkey has so much of historical sites that many are passed by daily without \"reflecting\"???",
          "This place reminds me a little bit of Istanbul. The sultanahmed area. A lot of shops and restaurants. Antalya is definatly a nice place for a citytrip.",
          "This was beautiful. The entire Old Town of Antalya was well worth the visit. The stores were fun and the restaurants were pleasant.",
          "God the architecture is in immaculate condition, to see 2000 year old buildings/monuments is a real honour and the old town makes you feel like you are back in the Roman Empire. Definitely worth a look!",

          "It's absolutely stunning down here to the old town. Quaint bars and shops and restaurants. Only downside we couldn't find a pram friendly entrance and had to carry ours down the steps",
          "it was a good place for walking and enjoying the way and the sea. a lot of restaurant are in the way and they are so beautiful.",
          "We had an afternoon walking through the ancient city and really enjoyed it. Most of the restaurants have their own swimming pools and we wished we had known as it was really hot and a dip would have been great. The buildings are fantastic and the locals seem to be far",
          "While place looks decent, the place is full of tourists and lots of shady sellers. Also be aware of local scammers during the night",
          "Old town with a shopping bazaar - we have found few good shops to buy unique stuff - worth to visit it and its surrounding areas - I would love to explore this area again if I have a chance - better to visit in evening when it is fully opened",
          "This is part of the historical sites you must visit in the old town of Kaleici. Nice to walk around and recommend to walk up to the pier.",
          "Nice bit of history...nothing more than that. Can get really busy wih tourists during the day. It's really nice at nights it's quiet romantic. Has the uplights which set the scene.",
          "great place to see the history of turkey, well worth a visit, told the romans built this site, when you walk through from the old town to the new town you get a surprise",
          "A very long passage. A lot of coffees and restaurants, small streets with authentic shops. Walking down the main street brings you directly to the sea",
          "Visited on a very hot day - was a nice attraction and we walked through the little alley ways to visit the other shops.",
          "It's old but not really impressive and with thousands of people trampling the stones everyday, they should preserve the area better.",
          "Beautiful area of antalya old town. When coming by taxi ask to be dropped at Hadrian gate and walk through the cobbled streets. Lovely",
          "I was amazed by this nice pre ottoman structure , it's worth a quick visit to take photos and to admire the beautiful columns and arches...",
          "This is a must see in Antalya...it's the history..and it's a good entrance to Kaleci . Very nice to see it in the dark also.",
          "Perhaps the best photo-opportunity. Use your imagination to compose some great pictures of your family.",
          "Came here with the family when we visited the old town. Lovely piece of historical monument. The old town itself was beautiful. Personally I don't think this was a suitable trip with the children don't think they appreciated it.",
          "Not big enough to spend above one hour. But it is the heart of the city and the start point of the old town. Must see.",
          "little piece of history in the heart of the city and the main road. its super adorable. something you see once and you don't see it anymore as its the side walk from main road to the old town. you just walk through and watch people taking pictures. its nice.",
          "Having a map of the Old Town, this was our starting point and we were able to see the brown tourist sign from the bus, so knew where to get off. It's an impressive gate, including some old walls, with information about it on nearby signs. From here the other sights of the Old",
          "Loved visiting this area, quaint little streets with lots of little bars, restaurants and shops and characteristic buildings. Great for Instagram or travel bloggers. The day we visited it rained and inside hadrians gate the paths are all marble which was very very slippy, I",
          "Read up about this historcal gate before visiting. It is for free and you would not spend more than 10 minutes at it.",
          "Spend at least half an hour here and go down the stairs to see the images on the ceiling of the gate. Breath taking historical place",
          "Antalya is full of history and this did not disappoint.fantastic people and the best part of Antalya Turkey.",
          "The triumphal arch builded for the first visit of the Roman emperor Hadrian in 130 is the only remaining entrance gate in the walls that surround the city and harbor. And going through it, stepping and the old surface and watching the beautiful white columns, is like stepping",

The Hadrian\u2019s Gate is a gift from the very past of Antalya in the heart of",

          "You can imagine a bit ancient times, how was the city entrance in past and how could you enter the city . it is good place for comparing 2 cities which one belongs to past and other belongs to current time only by sweeping your eyes around you.",
          "wonderful place that must visit at least two times. a long way that take to another world. I did enjoy.",
          "Pretty simple and average located on a crowded street with lots of people. Nice Architecture with nice surroundings!",
          "Neat landmark, and great way to get unlost when you're in the old city. Otherwise, if you're not a history buff, it's just another old stone gate.",
          "I feel like a roman emperor when I get into old city from Hadrian's gate. It is one of the well preserved roman gates",
          "You must be an absolute architecture buff if you are gonna like this one. It's literally just an worn-down plainlooking arch in the city wall and if you have some travel experience this will not be a place to behold. Impressive that it still stands, that's the only reason I give",
          "Such a stunning building, I can just imagine who has been through these gates in the past! It looks really lovely all lit up at night!",
          "we called there 3 doors since i was born in Antalya. you can consider as a gate to clear history. just enter. you will find sea.",
          "The old gate is a passage for the old town. I didn't see any historic data within the premisses but it is beautiful. It is still a gate dividing the new and the old city.",
          "Leads from Old to new Antalya - amazing restaurants and shopping in this area too. Try to go at sunset - the call for prayer makes it all that much more magical.",
          "if you come to in Antalya, want to starting amazing and nevet forget a travel, you should see and go!",
          "We enjoyed the gate and the little alleys inside kalei\u00e7i with lovely baaaars and restaurants with live bands and really really cheap drinks",
          "Special Gate to find in such area and most amazing that when pass it trying to reach to harbour, you feel like you move to another city which is old and even will shocked when find a lot of small nice hotels can't imagine that such building is great nice hotels most of them",
          "a place that you must visit as it is one of the pieces of the history of the old city , the Gate is not far form the city center and can be there in few minutes on foot",
          "Its like the little Roman in Antalya, built in the beginning of the history of Antalya and still can be viewed until today.",
          "In the middle of the city center you find Hadrian\u00b4s Gate. Its in old town. You have to have a walk in old town. Its so cozy and a special atmosphere. Nice restaurants and hotels as well.",
          "I am sure this sight would be more interesting if you come prepare with previous some knowledge. Unfortunately it was a bit lost on us.",
          "This was on my places to see and happened to stumble across it. The gate is between a bunch of buildings and shops and could be overlooked. The site is amazing but there is only a little placard with information. Work is being done so there was scaffolding but that is",
          "ok but you miss it if you aren't paying attention given its so old they should probably clean it up a bit and make it more apparent no?",
          "The Gate was surrounded by scaffolding when I visited it yet there was no sign of work being done or any workmen in the area! So, no nice photographs, etc.",
          "Gate built by Roman an entrance to the old City of Ka in old town and a lot of happening during day and nights, and surrounded with lot of restaurants, bars and shopping stores. Probably one of the best nices place to hang out and have fun.",
          "Nice gate, one enters from a modern boulevard into the Old Town sector. Wander there. Some nice places (rugs for sale) but also spice shops. Found a wonderful tea made with a variety of spices that provide energy.",
          "If you go to Kaleici old town there is only one entrance to go through and that is Hadrian's Gate, there are other ways in but this IS the one, it has been very well preserved and restored. The Turkish are very proud of their architecture.",
          "It is the same place as old city and harbour. It is the entrance to old city. But not interesting. May be only 1 picture.",
          "One of the many sights you can see while wandering around the old Town of Antalya, would definitly recommend staying in the old town and not in the big Hotels on the outskirts...so much atmosphere....as soon as we found ourselves in the new part of the city, we went back to the",
          "There is nothing much to see really as it is just the facade, but of course the historical significance is there. I rather enjoy the walk through the old town from the harbor and ended the walk here.",
          "To me it is an impressive entrance to the old city in Antalya. I am not really in to history , there are many entrances to Kaleici, but to go through Hadrian Gate makes me feel that I have entered into the history of the old city. The old city is a nice place to stroll around",
          "Called Hadrian's gate because construction mainly occurred after a visit by the Roman Emperor. Is set between two towers one roman and one medieval which formed part of the walls of the old town. Indeed there is a short section of old walls remaining at this location and",
          "if you love shopping this is the place :) so many amazing statues & buildings its a must to go down the harbour taking in the scenery as you do .. the building are so intriguing",
          "We went here with big expectation. We read a lot about the Hardrian's Gate but it was not according to our expectation. The Gate is interestingly built but then that is it. We expected more behind the gate. But it is just an area for the cafes and bars.",
          "The history here is amazing! Just one of the remaining Roman Empire structures, surrounded by Ottoman Empire architecture! Definitely worth seeing, and you MUST go into the old city! So many amazing views, smells, tastes, you will regret not going inside!",
          "it is a gate with historical importance as first roman emperor entered through this gate..so,must!!!",
          "The gate is magnificent, I am happy that the turkish authorities embark on reserving all their historical sites. This is so important for future generations. Beautiful pics can be taken at night.",
          "Step back in time, and wander around the town. It is mind blowing the time frames these archaeological pieces stem from and are so well preserved today",
          "Interesting historical architecture. Connects the hectic congested city of Antalya with old town Kaleici. Worth seeing if visiting the old town, but I wouldn't drive out of my way.",
          "Very thought provoking, a lovely piece of history, and the walk past the stalls, and restaurants, is well worth doing, lots of eating places a wonderful park lots to see.",
          "a delightful old gent sells souvenirs at this venue. He places a Turkish cap and waistcoat on you for photos. We had a good laugh.",

          "A visit to Hadrians gate for those who like historical places is very good to walk through and look at the stone work don't miss it if you are in Antalya is good to see .",
          "I love archaeology when you actually get to use it or see it up close. This gate isn't in the best state of repair but has been tastefully renovated over time showing the repairs as obvious additions. Love the glass bridge to protect the original flagstones and the fact it's",
          "An interesting and very well preserved Triumphal Archway celebrating the visit of Hadrian to the city. The modern bustling Antalya stands on one side and the old City, Kaleici, on the other. Walking through the gate to the old town gives a sense of the jump in time from the now",
          "If you are visiting the old city, be sure to walk through Hadrian's gate. A dramatic entrance to the old city. Vendors nearby selling lots of touristy things",
          "Interesting way to enter the old city. So glad to see that historic buildings are being preserved rather than torn down and replaced with modern buildings. Quite impressive the way it was constructed all those years ago.",
          "Built in the year 130AD, The gate is well restored, well decorated, and serves as a picturesque entry into the historic old town of Kaleici",
          "The Hadrian gate is the door of the old town - Kaleici. It is very well preserved and helps you to open a fascinating door to restaurants and to night life. It is the heart of Antalya.",
          "great to visit the old city. Wonderful buildings. We have visited before. Well worth a peek. Amazing to think that the Romans were there. The old mosque it fascinating too.",
          "Great place to visit and lots of shops and restaurants within the old city , very busy at night , leads down to marina",
          "Hadrians Gate is worth walking to as you explore Antalya. Is it a big 'wow'? Not really, but if you are there you should make the time to check it out.",
          "The gate is a ruin of Roman Empire built in the year 130. If you are interested in history and historical places you should see it and listen the history of this gate from a guide.",
          "This was a lovely piece of history to see cost us 2 Turkish lira to get to via public transport and is free to look around. There are lovely caf\u00e9s, restaurants and bars also shops all through the winding streets. Well worth a visit.",
          "It is a gate and you can read up its significance by googling it. But it is the entrance to some nice restaurants and bars to your left and the start of the bazaar to your right. You can get down to the harbour from here via steps. You know you have found old town when you see",
          "Great place, some really interesting architecture and stalls. Even a pipe and tobacco shop. Lovely cafes in restful vine covered walkways, serving great coffees. Beware of shoe shiners engaging you in conversation, it will always cost you, even if they say it is free - don't",
          "This area of the old town is full of character and charm with friendly shop and cafe/restaurant owners ( no pressure selling) we loved it.",
          "Would recommend a visit. Nice to see some of the history. Easy to find and shipping all around. Signs with historical explanations.",
          "Decided to stroll to Hadrian's gate during my stay in Antalya. Rich history with explanation at the side of the gate",
          "An impressive part of the old town although when we visited people were more interested in photographing a stray dog with puppies. Quite a thought that Hadrian travelled so far.",
          "In the middle of Old Town, was great to see. no costs involved, it is open to all. Nice places to see in around the area, shopping and restaurants.",
          "Nicely preserved gate. Surrounded by shops and stores. Pretty close to old town, so include it as part of the old town tour.",
          "Built in the name of the Roman Emperor Hadrianus, the 3 gates are amazing to look at. The architecture as with other buildings is amazing.",
          "Great afternoon stroll around what a lovely place, with some great places to eat and lovely little area worth a visit",
          "Its an impressive looking Gate, there are always people posing for pictures at the gate. It is not worth just visiting the Gate, but paired with the broken minaret, the old city (Kaleici) and the Marina, the old city bazaar and its a day well spent!",
          "Bit hard to find as it was not signposted, but it was very impressive. Takes you into the old city, which is full of beautiful little streets. Just stunning.",
          "Given the History it makes an interesting feeling knowing powerful armies entered there. Dont go out of your way though.",
          "Must see main attraction. We also did this as part of our E-bike Antalya tour together with the rest of the Old Town, Kaleici, Marina, Clock Tower, etc. You won't miss it while walking around the Old Town.",
          "Worth a short visit and a good entrance to OldCity. Built in Roman times in honor of Emperior Hadrian's visit.",
          "with all the works around we did not enjoy but it could be a good starting point to visit the city.We lost our friends and found them waiting for us at the gate.in the neighborhood opposite side to the right of the gate you can find the Catholic church (St Nicolas) Eucharistic",
          "There's not much to Hadrian's Gate, but in order to get to it you have to go through Old Town, which has a TON of cool shops, restaurants and hotels to check out. But Hadrian's Gate is similar to the Arc de Triomphe in the sense that it was built to honor the conqueror Hadrian",
          "The last surviving gate of Kaleici. A true landmark of history. The area surrounding the gate is packed with people. Try to go noon time to have good chance for best photos... never mind the heat in August :)",
          "Nice place in Antalya in the downtown area. Antalya has a lot of places to visit and this place has alot of historx",
          "nothing special, beautifully illuminated, convenient park in addition , pleasant environmentm there are a lot of restaurants and shops",
          "Hadrian's gate is well worth a visit because of it's historical interest. Very close by is garden with shaded benches where you can sit and relax and watch the world go by. You can buy Turkish tea from the vendors who serve you where you sit for half a lira. Just back from the",
          "'Triple arched gate-way' built in celebration of 'Haidrians' visit there over 2,000 years ago. in great condition, right on the main street in Antalya and 'free'. Through the gate leads to 'Old Kaleici' where you will find a variety of shops/stalls and small 'boutique' type",
          "Now this was a place to see. We happened by it walking on the street, and it was beautiful and cultural. The surrounding places are also worth the walk, so scope out the entire area.",
          "Very clean, small streets, bars, terraces and restaurants everywhere, superb houses, very animated atmosphere.",
          "It's located at the entrance of Kalilici. It's the monument of ancient Roman history of Hadrian emperor. It's appreciated that municipality keeps it in good condition.",
          "situated at the heart of the city, surrounded by interesting local crafts shops. There is a small park where you can enjoy your local turkish tea with only 1 lira.",
          "Good to see as you enter the old town. It's better then the picture. Clear signs and super informative. You can bring yourself back in time with your imagine as you stroll through.",
          "Hadrians gate is as advertised a big gate. I would not recommend travelling a great distance to see it however if you are in the neighborhood it is worth seeing.",
          "It was kinda different to see a ancient roman architecture in the middle of the city . The building was just stunning to be around the building .",
          "you can walk around isikler street and look old trams new art and part of old city wall but the best landmark in this street is hardians gate.this historical gate is fantastic .",
          "It's one of the photo opportunitys you have to do whilst in Antalya !! Lovely Cafe and restaurants in and around this area ! It's the gateway into the marina ! Take care in this area very uneven surface ! It is also a good name to remember if you need to get a taxi into the old",
          "I had a short stop at the gate while exploring old town kaleici, the gate has beautiful architecture and worth the see, there are nice cafes next to it for relaxing,",
          "This is one of the most historical touristic places in the city centre. Actually it is a triumphal arch which was built by Romans in BC 100. It is the entrance of the old town.",
          "Remnant from the Grecian architecture, this gate reminded of of Athens. The old city inside the Hadrians gate is quite charming and you would find lines of shops selling quaint stuff.",
          "This is a must. Well preserved, and very beautiful. Lot's of shops around the old town, a day can easily be lost here, there is so much to do after you have visited Hadrians Gate.",
          "We had a guide for this part of our visit to Turkey so we learned a lot of details about the buildings and area. Perhaps we learned a lot more than was necessary but I would still advise a guide as I felt we absorbed more of the incredible history of the Turks by having the",
          "Hadrian's gate is a nice stop for a few minutes and is very close to the shops and bazaar but that is about it. There is nothing much really to see.",
          "Gate was interesting and impressive. It was good condition and well-preserved. What makes Gate even more impressive was that there was original defense wall left in both direction to the gate.",
          "My tour group's hotel is a few blocks away. It is a quick photo opp if you are in Antalya with a sign to explain the significance. Lots of people in the area selling the same types of things sold around the city.",
          "Actually, it's not Hadrian's gate since it was built when Hadrian visited this part of Empire. Anyway it is great spot for taking pictures and it is easily accessible by public transportation. It's not big and you might miss it if not prepared.",
          "We were on a tour when we visited the Gate. It was an amazing area. The gate was well taken care of. Just Amazing",
          "It seems to be very old gate but the way to reach there was very hard and there was not a good sign for this place. even though it is not in a good conditions.",
          "Steeped in history. This is a must for visitors to Kaleici the old quarter of the city of Antalya. It is the main entrance to the walled old city. Bring your camera. Could be a convenient meeting point for groups. Mind the steps. Not good for the disabled as there are other",
          "There's a lot of walking, but the history behind this small area is fascinating enough to make it worthwhile. When we were there, they were doing some work on the gate and beyond, but you were still able to walk around and see a lot of it. There are markets set up past the gate,",
          "Not a very interesting place to visit in Antalya. Whilst it is a bit interesting, on a cloudy day, not somewhere I would make an effort to see",
          "This is a must see attraction. It is located on a main street and marks one of the entrances to the old town. It is easy to get to and to find. The trolley line runs right by the sight. The sight is well kept but the plexiglass bridge over the old Roman road could stand a",
          "Hadrian's Gate is very cool to look at. Lot's of detail. Be careful walking on the glass bridge that underneath: it is very slippery. If you want to experience being a local, sitting on the park benches outside gate is very interesting place for people watching. Local old men",
          "The Hotel is in a very nice spot, close to nice restaurants and sights. Accommodation was comfortable and service good. Staff were friendly and helpful. They provide parking, but you have to walk a bit. Driving here was nerve wrecking",
          "New Antalya meets old Antalya through Hadrian's gate. Enter the old part of Antalya into Kaleici and step back in time admiring the old architecture.",
          "Situated amidst some interesting shops including one selling expensive nougat. Worth exploring around here after some walk via the bazaar.",
          "Not really an \u2018attraction\u2019 as such - simply one of a few stopping points to look at historical structures on a walk around the old city walls (or to be used as one or the current pedestrian entrances into the old city). It has an explanatory sign and is worth a photo but is",
          "I would fully recommend visiting the Old Town of Kaleici and, if you're there already, you may as well seek out this attraction. It's still in use as a gate into the town and some of it's detail is perfectly preserved.",
          "As the gate to the old city, this is a beautiful piece. However, it is now home to businesses, and the natural beauty and history are lost in it. there are some signs that teach you about the history. I'd suggest going early in the day to enjoy it in peace and solitude.",
          "Hadrian's Gate is very well preserved and is part of the old city. It's easy to find and see during your old city tour.",
          "Easy to get to and worth a look if interested in the Roman history. Not much there for signage and is clearly used as a regular walkway into old city",
          "hadrians gate is situated on ataturk cadessi,antalya main shopping-promenade and were you can switch from the modern tram from busstation to historical tram to archeological museum. in the museum i liked the roman marble sculptures of roman emperor hadrian. hadrians gate is an",
          "I didnt like it all. It looks like is under renovation, but i wasnt sure. Didnt even bother to take a picture there!",
          "lots of shops and things to potter around, nice if your in the area to have a look around. I don't know if I'd specifically go to see the gate but it was nice to see whilst I was there.",
          "I loved everything about this old part of the city, shops and restaurants on every corner, full of atmosphere.",
          "It is in the centre of Antalya city and easy accessable by walk if staying in Keleici area. Tramway very close to Hadrian gate. Nice lightings and pleasant atmoshpere in the evening and Surrounded by shops and pubs. Gate filled with historical Roman architecture If you are in",
          "Definitely worth the stop if your exploring the old city. Great place to take pictures though if your driving parking might be a bit difficult to find.",
          "This gate dates back to the Roman era, its architecture is amazing and has been restaured. This is a great point to start your exploration in the Old City.",
          "To think that something that dates back to the first century is still around today is just amazing! It's had some repairs to help preservation but is still incredible.",
          "I had this to my list of things to see in Kaleci while I walked around in circles getting lost. Found it easier by walking on the outside of the wall. Worth a couple of pictures.",
          "It is a very nice gate, or at least it has been. Now unfortunately it is surrounded by tourist shops and bars. Nevertheless as it is in the city center of Antalya you should go and see it if you are there anyways",
          "Nice trip out of the all inclusive hotel. However if you have been a bit around Europe this is nothing that will blow your mind. Just a nice touristic place with some roman arches and clean. Would not go there just for it.",
          "Hadrian's Gate is a landmark dating to the Roman times (read the history on the posted signs). They have covered the center lane with a bridge (likely for preservation reasons) so it's difficult to see where the grooves from the carts are unless one goes around and kneels on the",
          "Tricky to find, a few sign posts but not many. We stumbled across it by accident Worth a visit No fees Have added a few photo's",
          "Visited Feb 2015. Really is fabulous. So intricate so interesting. Gate leads to maze like streets. Be careful as we got lost for an hour with small children!! Little market shops in between. Must visit this area.",
          "The gate itself is of great historical interest, but it leads into the old city and a wealth of interesting alleyways and narrow streets. Take your time to just wander and take it all in!!",
          "Great selfie photo here to be had. Entrance to walk to port and many souvenir vendors along the walk down. Take the elevator back up to the main street level so you don't have to walk up from the port, which could be strenous on some folks and deter them from going. Antalya",
          "It's a historical attraction you don't want to miss because really, if you do it's because you're walking with your head in your iPhone. Nothing hugely interesting to see, but something to cross off your list. Or close your eyes and imagine ancient times while you're there and",
          "There you can see how Ottoman's where ruling the world. Very nice place. You cannot imagine how did they build the area in these old days.",
          "The gate marks the boundary of Antalya old town and is a good place to start exploring. We pretty much did a drive-by, just enough to appreciate that it is relatively complete and intact, and quite impressive in its solidity as are many of Turkey's beautifully preserved Roman",
          "This is a great place to begin a waking tour of the old town. After walking through the gate from the street side turn right and walk the old alleys. This is a great example of Roman architecture from the 2nd century AD.",
          "Nice architecture and great the view if you have a spare 10 minutes , the streets behind it are lovely to walk through",
          "we went here on a day the museam was shut its very quiet plenty of gift shops but be careful there are pple who will start telling you history of the place if you are showing interest then ask for money and a sho shine guy who don't take no for answer bit pushy",
          "This should be your starting point when you want to explore the Old Town of Antalya. The gate is over 1800 years old and dates back to the Roman era.",
          "there isn't that much left from the old walls around ancient Antalya. But the leftovers do give an impression of how big it must have been.",
          "The gate is a large, ominous structure which is the entrance to the old walled city. The easiest way to find it is to follow the tram tracks running for some kilometres along the foreshore in Antalya city. At one end of the tram route is the Antalya Museum and six stops",
          "Its this beautiful piece of ancient history that stands there where you would least expect it, being a kind of portal to another time. I stayed there for a while just enjoying being there with such a structure.",
          "just get to see the gate and know the history behind it. Stop here if you are in the area. It's worth it",
          "we passed by the Gate while walking going to the town center. We took photo only from outside the Gate and didnt go inside but from outside we could see how beautiful the architecture of the Gate and its areas.",
          "even though it is in the city proper it's well worth the time to go and see this especially if you are interested in history",
          "It is a triumphal arch in the name of Emperor Hadrian. Free entrance. You can walk into Old Town. Worth to see.",
          "Well preserved the gate also known as the three door gate is worth a visit as a photo op. The boulevard is modern and bustling with shops . A must see however is the walk inside the gate. The Old town of Anatalya . Step into the doors walk down the alleys and welcome to a grand",
          "This is located in the old town. It is free to visit, you can can stop by in the afternoon or the evening to see it. It was build by the same emperor who build the wall separating Scotland from England in ancient time. It is well preserved. It is worth the visit.",
          "Hadrian's Gate is in good condition and probably worth seeing if you are in Anatalya. A good example of honorific architecture of the time. However, it is located in a very busy part of the city and seems somewhat out of place with its surroundings...and so loses a lot of its",
          "One of the best preserved monuments of the city lets you enter the old city and its narrow streets and small houses.",
          "Hadrian gate is one of the three gates to the old town and the best preserved one. It is only open to walking in/out of the old town; you cannot pass by car. Worth to visit during the day and night for making breathtaking photos.",
          "A beautiful and well preserved gateway to the old town. Incredible detailing. We found the best time to visit and get photographs without the place being overtaken by other tourists was before 10am, however it was also beautifully lit at night but to busy with crowds",
          "Hadrian really got around the world. Here his gateway stands in good repair and is the entrance to the \"castle area\" or old town.",
          "We went nearby Hadrian's Gate. I think... in old Antalya. it's ok... we should have read about it to fully appreciate the site. It takes imagination to see what it was like... Again, we are not historian...",
          "Hadrian's Gate is one of the main routes into Antalya's old town. You can really feel this history as you step down to the ground level as it was in Roman times. The arch was built in 130 AD to commemorate Hadrian's visit to the town. It is built of white marble and the glass",
          "Our trip to Hadrian's gate was sidetracked by a street vendor! He had 2 bunnies that of course my kids wanted to pat. Well - they pat them and held them and before we knew it - the vendor gave us a little fortune - selected by the bunnies, then he's popped a string on our",
          "If you're touched by the history, I mean ancient history, bug see it. You might walk by it and not even realize what it is, so keep your eyes open! It's a gate (we'd call it an arch) and great for photos. We have a couple b/w architectural close-ups of Hadrian's Gate in our",

          "Hadrian's gate has become a well-known landmark of Antalya but it's current form is actually a reconstruction and remaking of the original. Is a nice way to enter Kaleici.",
          "Like everything here, it\u2019s just full of History! Hadrian was a builder! Walls in Scotland, Library\u2019s in Athens and Gates in Antalya. Mind you, \"what did the Romans ever do for us?\"",

          "The gate is easy to find. It won't blow your mind like some of the other sites you find in Turkey but it is still of interest. If you are in the old town it is worth a visit.",
          "There are steps on the inside of the walls, accessed through a bar. They take you up to the top. Highly recommended, but not for those with a fear of heights as there's no railing!! Beautiful and well maintained but will not take you much time. Small park in front full of",

          "Easy to miss, this can be reached after wandering up the cobbled streets from the old harbour back to the city centre. Small in size, it's been well preserved and worth a visit.",
          "This is worth looking at if you are in the area but no need for a special trip. There is not much there other than the start of the markets but it's a nice building.",
          "Takes a few minutes to view. A pic or 2 and you are done. If staying in the old city you will go past and thru it many times.",

          "We enjoyed it. Very historic. Not much to do but take a pictuure - but worth it! Definitely worth a visit.",
          "I have visited previously and although I understand it may be for safety reasons the new runways over the gate make it look unattractive along with the graffiti we spotted such a shame it isn't looked after.",

          "I would give 5 \ud83c\udf1f for aqualand but not for the dolphinland. For me, it is not a dolphinland it is just a dolphin's show.",
          "The smallest waterpark i have ever been to. Overpriced. Only about 8 slides in total. Really crappy to be honest, although SOME of the staff were really nice and friendly.",
          "My 5 year old is absolutely crazy about everything marine related especially whales. So as soon as I realised this aqua park had a beluga whale we had to visit. Please dont trust their website its absolutely nonsense. It states that the park opens at 10:30am as we find out it",
          "If yiu never went before to huge water park, then you will enjoy there, especially for kids between 5 and 15. The food price is acceptable. And when you finish at 5pm, you can go visot the aquarium 5 min walking from there.",
          "I went in august for a one day trip to the delphinland and aquarium. The place looks like as if they had spare space at the back of the house, and they didn\u2019t know what to do with it... and so they came up with the idea to bild a delphin/whale pool (the place didn\u2019t look",
          "my family was amused with the dolphin land show, the prices were excellent for the quality of show, the show consist of 3 parts, sea lions and 2 types of dolphins, in general we enjoyed it. also they have reliable online ticket purchase system. I would suggest the photo session",
          "Went with a family and all of us really enjoyed Aqualand. Great selection of slides, no long queues typical for such parks and the price is attractive especially if purchasing tickets online. Great value! Definitely recommend while visiting Antalya.",
          "Came here for my young one. Price is OK. Paid 75lira per person. Good selection of slides and a good area for kids. The wave pool was nice too. Really good value for money.",
          "We went to Aqualand in the morning and my two children are 12 and 8, and they could play on all the slides, which they enjoyed very much. The lady at the lockers was very nice and good with responsibility to look after the lockers and the things inside them. We spent around 3",

          "We only went to Dolphinland and I would not come back again. The pool itself looked very old and washed out and not kept great. The show was average but by this point I was already upset. Soon as you walked in it was just like hearing Dolphins cry constantly. Then they came out",
          "very nice water park, not so busy, we only visited the aqualand not the the dolhinland, I think some of the slides on the pictures are in the dolphinland. the queues are very short and fluent unlike the land of legends, it will be nice to see more places to eat inside the park,",
          "Went here three days ago with my lady the rides and whole experience as a whole was decent. We had a good time it was much cheaper to actually just turn up at the place and buy a tickets like the locals do rather than through a agency rep etc or excursion seller lol we paid",
          "If you can only do one water park I\u2019d recommend going to land of legends. This one is a bit older and so are the slides. However there are no to little ques for the slides, so can do it in half a day. It does need some new updated features as the ladders out of pools are wobbly",
          "Excellent place to spend a day, not expensive either, they will give you a card that you can top up to 200 TL so you don't need to carry money around, you also can keep your valuable belongs in a locker for no extra costs. Dolphin show is excellent",

          "Very fun for the kids. We had 4 children two under 2 and 2 were 5 and 8. They absolutely loved it great way to cool Them down in the scorching heat. Didn\u2019t visit the dolphins land so cnt comment on that . You have to top up your cards with money to use to buy things at the park.",

          "Visited today. Slides are good but read on for further advice. We booked thru a street operator and ended up paying 120 quid for 4 which included food and transfers. Much cheaper just to get a taxi and pay at the door. Food and drink inside the place is dirt cheap so don't",

          "We paid 59 TRY (10 EUR), wich is entrance, a meal (hamburger, d\u00f6ner or pizza) and a beverage included. Very cheap! You get a card to pay in the park, it's cash free. The rest of the money is returned when you leave the park. The slides are amazing! Listen to the instructions,",
          "Aqualand is made for fun for kids and adults. I really do appreciate lifeguards who were standing behind of my children all day and give live examples how to swim. Great place to have a small journey especially with your children. Advised to buy towels and swim suites from",
          "The park is quite small with only 6-7 slides. Only 3 of these are really cool. We had fun but 2-3 hours is definitely enough, unless you go there with small children who will probably enjoy babbling around in the pool for much longer. Cleanliness is ok but the changing rooms",

          "I like it , I enjoy it , and I love it. Jeep your children happy and let them watch the Dolphin life. Wonderful land. A Mazing Dolphin show. Ducks swim in their pool. Also you can enjoy the pools game which made happy. Many activities and you have to choose what belong to you.",

          "We had free entrance to the park, since we were staying at Hotel Su... Beautiful and exciting experience... We will do it again",
          "The fun in the circus of water was impressive.Water acrobats were amazing and very courageus. The acrobat boy was fast and easy to move. The dolphins,the sea seal and the whales were fantastic.It was a great show.",
          "Do not waste your Time and money no private shower no clean changing room. not enough slides and entertainment. wave pool start 3 hours after opening of aqua park most of slides are twin but one of them not working and its cause to crowed. only if you have a children here is",
          "Worth a visit. We had fun. You can tell it's a old park, pavements were coming up, safer to wear flip flops around. All the rides were aggressive, battered around into walls etc. The swirl bowl was definitely bumpy. Most of the slides were just fast but rough. The hill slide was",
          "I had an amazing experience at Troy Aqua & Dolphinarium. My children had so much fun there. Hope to return next summer.",
          "perfect place and the Dolphinland show was very special and really worth the money we all love it. they have the white dolphin so cute.",
          "The park was below average, had maybe 8 slides, 2 pools, jacuzzi and a kids area. Many slides weren't working and 1 looked extremely unsafe to ride. The wave pool was the only thing that was running smoothly and the waves came every couple of hours. Had no gift shop and staff",
          "Good but not exelent. Rooms are good Servivce and clean not very good Foods are bad. Realy bad Bars are very good. 9 bars are in hotel and 1 bar 24 .",
          "You can easily spend half a day here, the kids love it. The place is safe, well kept. The surfing area can be a little rough for unexperienced kids, but other than that, all good. It's another way to spend half a day during your stay at Rixos Premium Belek.",
          "Huge, enormous. Long water slides with high slope (some scary :-)). Bar with good and fresh alcoholic and soft drinks. Greek-style ornaments, a dolphinarium which unfortunately will be moved to Rixos World of Legends. A nice surf pool.",
          "Our childeren loved that place. They nearly spent half of the day there. Stuff are very nice and helpful.",
          "We enjoyed the water park, I especially liked the wave pool. This was only at certain times of the day. Everyone else loved the slides but unfortunately not all the slides were open when we visited.",
          "great park with doplhins and other animals to see. Waterpark and much more for kids to play. You can walk within some minutes from hotel to Try Aqua Park",

          "A wonderful place . Every thing is perfect in the hotel.. great service and a kind people . We have a good holiday",
          "a bit old we had 2 young kids and they didn't like it also no service at the time we arrived the bar didn't had lemonade or other juice fir kids..",
          "Nice rides. Clean . 5 USD per Pictures is very high easy . . It was good but i assume that the Legend had rendered it useless",
          "Came all inclusive choices of food was poor however after eating chips for 2 week at out hotel a half cooked pizza was welcomed. The slides are great fun and your not pestered here to buy anything its a relaxed experience The drinks are all branded so my kids was happy. The",
          "At the time we've visited beginning of July 2016 was it partly closed e.g there wasn't the delfinarium opened and some of the pipes were out of service. I truly liked that the park overall was followed of Roman theme and Troy horse and you can see different details of that",
          "Go there if you like more fun. Good food and service and you have to be careful not to eat so much food.",
          "Booked a hire car to take my family to this water park, in Belek only to be told upon arrival that it is for hotel guests only! Very disappointing. Website seems to be for a park in Antalya and not Belek! Argh",
          "It's a small water park where kids over 130 cm can enjoy all slides Some of the slides were closed and the lazy river also, the wave beach start operation at noon It's good for Rixos Premium Belek guest who likes aqua park to have fun during there stay because the park is a part",
          "Hi Any one knows if the park is open on october?? What about ladies with hijab swiming clothes?? Are they allowed",
          "We visited in August and to be fair only 3 slides where opened along with the wave pool. I believe this waterpark will either be closed or refurbished. In my opinion just head straight to the Land of Legends which is fantastic.",

          "This waterpark ajoins the Rixos Premium Belek, the hotel we stayed at, and is all included for guests. It was fantastic to have your own waterpark within the hotel.. just brilliant..",
          "We was very excited dolphins,we never see in reality dolphins,I was very exilent,we was seated completely in central, dolphins come very nearest to us we was very happy,also we take pictures with Dolphins,it's very superb,we hope you enjoy as well",
          "Great water games in spite that some of were closed .... First experience in water surf .... Waves pool",
          "Great fun with lots of flumes of old and young. There is a great wave ride as well which is open for two, two-hour slots. The wave lagoon is great and there was loads of space. However, Rixos have opened a new water park in Belek in the last two weeks and so the dolphin show",
          "The best bit of the lazy river was closed and so was the restaurant. There were rides that were not open while we were there.",
          "We wanted a day away from the salt and sand and this was a good option. Tickets were a fair price for what was on offer. There was a large range of different slides. Not too many steps and the queues seemed to move quickly. There were plenty of sun beds and shade available",
          "The aqua park was a lot of fun. There are a few slides that were not open at the time of my visit, but even without them there were still enough slides to enjoy. This is currently only open to Rixos hotel guests which made for very few people there which can be both a pro and a",
          "Although there are not lots of facilities there, you can enjoy completely. I consider to use this part of hotel. It is open at 10 o'clock and you can be there for 8 hours.",
          "Defiantly one of the best waterparks Ive ever been too! Was a bit busy. But they have so many different slides and an amazing lazy river that goes around the park. Would defiantly return!",
          "This Aqua Park is now for Rixos Premium guests only and not everywhere is open. Lazy river is partly closed off and water doesn't flow round so you don't move. The wave pool came on after we had been there for 2 hrs. It was very quiet and no queues for any of the slides that",
          "I was there in june 2016 and the aqua park wasn t what i expected. There weren t all the slides opened. Everything looked very old and ugly. I can not see the dolphins because they did not have a show , in the middle of june.",
          "Great aqua park with lots of different slides. Dolphinarium not open when we were there. Only open to hotel customers. Clean. Lovely staff. Lifeguards. Lots of Sun beds. Small bar area with fruit available. No other food when we were there. Great place.",
          "We went to the park while on vacation in Rixos. Nice, yet nothing spectacular, old and quite empty, not a good variety of entertainment. The majority of things are not available for kids under 10y of age, which was an issue for us.",
          "The best summer attraction! ^^ The show was incredibly great and the dolphins were so cute. There was lot of funny music and shows.",
          "fun fun fun is all I can say.sunny and safe to let your kids go free and have there own fun so the kids can enjoy there time definetly\u2026",
          "According to the website, the Dolphin Aqua Land is closed. I called anyway looking for a swim with the dolphins. A woman answered the phone at the Belek location and said that they were closed as they are moving locations, but the dolphins were there and would love to swim",
          "i and my younger brother are both of them like it.both of us have fantastic time there.it is really good place.go there and enjoy your time",
          "Our tickets were provided free by Rixos Premium. They had performing white whales, a brilliant walrus and three dolphins. It did seem that they pushed a little too hard to get people to have photos done and to swim with the dolphins ( both rather pricey)",
          "A must visit for the family, an enjoyable and spectacular spok in Belek. If your looking for a day away from the hotel, this is a good choice.",
          "An average waterpark. There is only a small children's slide section as children have to be 10+ to ride any of the decent slides. Selection of music is worrying, can hear swear words being blasting through the speakers often, think this is due to language barrier and they can't",
          "not lots of facilities for the kids! there are only two slides for the kids under the age of 6. but there is a nice Rixi club, so not a nig problem",
          "Troy Park was a great add on to our resort, the hotel's entrance was 2 min walking distance from our villas which was excellent. the slides and water park in general is lovely, the lazy river is awesome! The dolphin show is excellent it was about 1 hour long, in addition to my",
          "Children will be endlessly happy and Troy is able to amaze everyone. I'm quite sure that all the visitors will have a good time there and will be left with wonderful memories only",
          "If you travel with children, this is one of 'must go there' attractions. Our kids loved the venue and all what they saw there. 5-star recommendation!",
          "Nice water park, not that big, but good enough for kids and family. Fishing spa is excellent but nobody there speak English!!",
          "Being only 500 metres away from the Aqua park we thought why not. Entrance is \u20ac25 for an Adult and \u20ac20 for a child, which is your basic entrance into the park with food not included. Please note your child has to be 10 to use most of the slides. The slides are fun and well",
          "good enough but not best been in however, the surfing machine was very good and the dolphine/whale show was great. recommend you pay extra to swim with them as it was great",
          "Part of the Rixos Belek this water park is great fun not only is it free for Rixos guests it is a day out in its self You can also go to the dolphin show great for adults too!! quiter after 3 o clock :)",
          "We had the opportunity to use Aquapark several days in a row since it was part of our hotel stay (rixos) and it is a super fun place for kids!",
          "We loved it, the show was great and intenssive, 3 kinds of show: Whale, Dolphins and sealion was a bit hot, but worth it.",
          "If you are going to antalya then dolphin land us a must visit it is a bit expensive to vusit the dolphins but it is well worth it",
          "It wasn't worth the payment. I wish we didn't go. It wasn't clean. It wasn't fun. The food was terrible. Everything of it was awful.",
          "We saw, what was a firmly average show, in a small place, crowded with all sort of people, big part of them coming in after the show has started. The show it self is fun and interesting especially for the children, but they made it look so commercialized that you feel like",
          "I liked so much, I went 3 times because it was free for rixos premium belek Hotel guests... you should stay one day there were so many slides and activities for trying...",
          "it was a great day to spend at Troy with family especial for kids, they enjoy the slides and the Dolphin show. but i believe that other things there are very expensive like photos abd food",
          "The animals (dolphins) are kept in the equivalent of a bath tub to them, please do not support this cruelty.",
          "The show was amazing, especially the walrus. After its performance was a break and the guests were invited to take photos with wales and walrus or check their dolphinarium. So I took my 2,5 year old daughter to take a photo with white wale. I was charged 22 Euro up front and",
          "The food was ok and the Aquapark was great but the show is horrible! Its animal cruelty and shouldn't be a thing!!",
          "Rixos Premium Belek guests have a free access to the Troy Water park, however surprisingly it was closed on one of the days so one should check before planning the trip.",
          "Im going to the Aqua park at the end of June 2015, I just wanted to know the prices for an adult, and then exspeneses when inside the aqua park - food, drink etc. What currency do they charge you in, turkish lira or euro? Any other bits of info I should know please comment belot",
          "This water park is not the biggest we have ever visited but it is excellent value for money. It can get very busy early on in the day but from 2.30-3.00pm it suddenly empties out when all the coaches leave and you almost have the park to your self. The kids loved it so for that",
          "exciting and worthy to go , not very crowded and also had locker . the dolphin's show was very nice and exciting . recommend it . the sharks aquarium was small but good to see small sharks ans also swim with.",
          "Been promised to swim with a dolphin (30 min program). But when we got there 21 person to swim one by one for 45 minutes. In total two times allowed to swim on Dolphins back ( two small circles around pool) , two times allowed to throw a ball and two times pat his back. After",
          "The show was interesting, funny and unforgettable we really enjoyed our time, great show for kids and adults",
          "I visted this place about 4 years ago and i just wanted to see if it was still open hence why im only just doing a review. This place disgusted me! The poor dolphins are kept in a tiny pool to drag people around. I can remember queing up with my sisters to swim worrying because",

          "Sat their for an hour watching the show we all thought it was not worth the money seen better on the TV you could swim with the dolphins for about \u00a3100 after the show you can also have your photo taken with the dolphin as it sits up in the water with price at only10 or 20 euros",
          "... and average. The park itself is not very big if you compare to many in EU, Dubai or Cyprus and is crowded. Didn't find a good parking which was expected just by the entrance. Not enough sun beds & umbrellas. Too many annoying business and everything around is shouting",
          "Nice show with dolphins, small whales and other marine creatures. Worth seeing. Very crowded :) and a bit hot for the end of may...",
          "Dragged along against my better judgement to see wild animals performing to people who go home after the show and do not think about the fact that these are feeling creatures who belong in extended families in the seas and oceans, I just left feeling sad that we pay to exploit",
          "Troy Aqua and Dolphinarium is certainly place that shall be visited in Belek area. We were on dolphin show and swimming and that was mazing experience. There are dolphins and belugas - white wails. Staff is very nice and kind. Every recomendation.",
          "Water park was great, especially as Rixos hotel guests had sole access after 3pm. A private swim with the dolphin for our family was fantastic & a dream come true for my wife on her birthday.",
          "The first part of the show, with wales and the sea lion was beautiful. The second part, with dolphins was just a big circus, most of the time was an \"auction\" for a painting made by the dolphins. The real show was about 10 minutes. In the break you could make pictures with the",

          "I spent last week with my family in Turkey. One of the things kids wanted to see was Aqua Park so we (over) paid to get to Troy. It was a big disappointment - it is the smallest Aqua Park I have ever seen in my life. It was a joke...where should I start... There is one wave pool",
          "Fantastic and included if you are staying at the Rixos Belek. Lots of rides ,safe,clean and great fun",
          "All around Troy Aqua is very wonderful, but my child may stay all the day long to the Surf Area, from the opening time 11.00 up to 17.00, and not trying nothing else",
          "it has been 3 weeks since we've been there. My son still keeps talking about dolphins. When buying photos though cut the prices they tell you by half at least. And buy them just before leaving, they'll give you cheaper prices anyway.",

          "There are a lot of slides and you can do a lot of things there! It's the biggest and the best Aqua Park in Turkey.",
          "Nice place to visit if You want to escape blazing august sun.Average is only that it needs more attractions and clear defined delphinium opening hours.No remarks on a service and choice regarding food, but a little bit complicated procedure for ordering and payment method.Nice",
          "We visited Dolphins show at Troya Dolphinarium with our kids. They loved it. It was wonderful. After show they could touch dolphins, swim with them (extra fee).",
          "We (family of 4) visited as part of a holiday excursion. Prior to the show starting there are staff selling popcorn, candy floss, cold drinks and snacks and fruit bowls and ice creams. The staff are all shouting and vying for your attention and we found it quite overpowering.",
          "very good , kids loved it. My childre aged 4 and 6 did not really go on many slides but enjoyed the toddler area and the lazy river.",
          "Place was crowded but we found a location neat to artificial wave area Water was little bit cold bet refreshing We have enjoyed Dolphin show Suitable to spend the hole day",
          "The rides and dolphin show in this park were the best.also it was very near to Rixos Belek or rather is a part of it.",
          "My husband and I went there and had a lot of fun. But veriety of slides are not impressive. It would be better if the tube slides were more and longer. In addition staff were not very helpful and safety standards wasnt very high and one of the rides hurt my back. But I liked",
          "Only open 1 day which we didn't know park good just remember to empty pockets before going on slides my 11 year had his iPod in his pocket and forgot to tAke it out",

          "It was one of those life moments when you realize that you are doing something that only few people in the world have done. Swimming with the dolphins was very exciting and interesting. We even did not felt that the water was cold :-)",
          "Nice place with 12 slides and 3 pools. The foods were not bad. The only thing was lack of facilities like not enough tubes.",
          "I didn't like the fact that was dirt on the floor, under the chaise longue, not sand. Very noisy and crowded. Still, a good aqua park if you like these stuff.",
          "Well....its ok for a day out and something to do. The wave pool is tiny and the slides are pretty much all the same. The food is gash to be honest and the fact they keep sharks etc in a tank no bigger than my living room is shocking and bordering on animal cruelty. The park is",

          "The Troy Aqua Park was announced to be the biggest and best park in the Antalya region, now that is [--]! The Waterplanet in Alanya is much better, bigger and you get to spend an entire day there. By all means, Troy looks nice with all the rides going trough the Trojan horse,",
          "The show is very nice - the show late afternoon depending on the season will be quite hot - teperature goes sky high. Theonly annoying aspects which ruin the pleasure: permanent hassle of photos with the fish, or theultimate annoyment - dolphins do a drawing and then the try to",
          "Troy was a waste of money 4 of the slides did not open we had to wait for an hour for a rubber ring for one ride as there are no lifeguards at bottom of slides to usher you to give them up to waiting people....ADULT MALE RUSSIANS where going on the rides again and again and",
          "I attended the park and had a good day, my family enjoyed there visit. It is not cheep to enter the park and I did not expect hidden cost whilst inside. The staff in the food halls could not be bothered and the cost of some goods where over the top.",
          "This place makes bayroute look good! Overpriced for a handful of samey samey rides and the lazy river is very well named as you have to push yourself round! Sunbeds are literally side by side and head to bottom on a patch of dirt surrounded by metal mesh fences, I would rather",
          "The aqua park was ok but I certainly won't be goin again. I mainly wanted to go to swim with the dolphins which we did do but at a very high cost of about \u00a3120 for about 4min in the water and 20min sat with our feet in just touching the dolphins. The aqua park had about 10slides",
          "The show was not very bad, but nothing special. The trainers looked bored and without life joy. But the worst thing is ugly atrempts to sell everything before, during and after show.",
          "My girlfriend and I visited today and so bad was our experience I have been driven to write this review immediately. We took a taxi from our hotel, The Gloria Serenity, down to The Rixos Premium and arrived at 9.30 to beat the hordes of tourist buses. The evidence was stark,",
          "the group all travelled to the water park on our last proper day, we had such a laugh and the day went so fast the waterfalls had us laughing as we ended up being stuck under them.. the hourly waves was the best being swept along them.",
          "Ok for older kids/youth, but stressing and noisy. Lots of russians and nothing really for the smaller kids, ok attractions was there whith 2 and 16 y.o. and we left for the hotel and even the 16yo didnt want to stay.",
          "I can be short about Troy Aqua & Dolfinarium: it;s nothing special, expensive and outdated. Within an hour you have seen the whole park and it's attractions.",
          "Great Dolphinarium programme for whole familly! Children liked show very much, specially sea lions. It wasn't boring at all!",
          "Good entertainment but extremely busy, you had to queue a lot, but of course middle of summer what you can expect...",
          "Definately recommended....great place to hang for a day....lazy river, scary slides it has it all went twice once in 2011 & once in 2012",
          "All the balenas, dolphins and morsa were magic, fantastic; our kids were very happy to see them. The troy aqua was very nice, incredible experience.",
          "Don't go there, don't buy the ticket for these dolphinshows. They have wild captured dolphins from Taiji. Please get informed about what is really happening to dolphins in captivity esp Turkey is known for having dolphins from Taiji. If you love dolphins, get informed! Also how",
          "This aqua park is really great. I remember I was at a show with dolphins and I thought I can swim with them but wasn't possible because you are not allowed. Another thing you should know is the fact that there are a lot of noisy kids, but otherwise is nice.",
          "Great show but really expensive in aquapark. and so much crowded. I think,They steal dolphins and other animals souls.",
          "It was a super experience for the children and us too. The show is good, the photos which they make are excellent.",
          "Rides are ok, not that thrilling. Dolphine show is great. Best thing is the \"surfing machine\"- with only 20 euros you get to surf all day. Even my 55 year old dad got crazy about it.",
          "a nice water park for a hotel resort and the Dolphinarium is good, but nothing special if you've seen these before 3/5.",
          "Our Dolphinarium in Anapa (Russia) is much more better and interesting. There were also too many people, bored staff and dolphines. Our daughter was not very excited by the show.",
          "My kids wanted to go and play in the Troy waterpark, but we found out that there is only few slides and attractions to play at and most of them are for big kids or adults, so they were not able to play on them and the ones that were for their age, my kids didn't like them.",
          "I have been in Dophin show in Belek, and it was much better - longer and with more different animals. Too expensive. Do not recommend.",
          "I stayed in Turkey for a week in Side and the coach journey to the waterpark was 45mins long and we thought it was 3hrs !! Are trip advisor was very nice and gave us all the information we needed to know, the waterpark was amazing and wasnt expensive at all ! the dolphinarium",
          "Without any doubt, this is the worst aqua park that I have ever been in. It was dangerous dirty, overcrowded, the facilities were limited, the slides boring and the food outlets dire. I cannot believe that such a substandard attraction can be part of the Rixos Premium \u2013 an",
          "nice show i liked it but taking photos with dolphin cost 25 euro for photo and swimming with dolphins 100 is very expensive",
          "Nothing new for those who have neen in dolphinarium at least once. For kids it is great attraction anyway but why adults should pay for this show twice more than children? Would be more logical to set the same price for kids and parents.",
          "We loved it. Particularly the beluga whales and the Walrus. Smashing. My 17 year old daugfhter couldn't stop laughing",
          "We stayed at Rixos, which gives guests free access to the park. There are plenty of rides, which the kids love. I preferred the lazy river or wave pool. If you are staying the hotel, it is best to go after 3:30pm when the coach parties start leave and it gets quieter. The",
          "Some slides were closed but most our children couldn't go on as they had to be 10 however, they would bend the rules sometimes.",
          "Very good with dolphins and a very clever walrus. Enjoyed very much but too much emphasis on selling expensive drinks and other accessories",
          "I have been there and it was excellent.I have never seen anything like this in my life.It was like I could go there a million times and it won't be borring",
          "A lot of people and endless lines at the slides, drinks not found in area, if you are not at 9,30 you have the risk to don't have a ring to slide",
          "Quite a small park with about 12 slides, a small wave pool and a lazy river. There is a surfboard simulator ride but it was closed on my visit. The slides are average, they're decent on first go but you wouldn't queue to go back on any of them. Some of the slides need a mat",
          "A 10 minute walk from our hotel - Letoonia Golf, the park itself is compact and situated between hotels. If you have been to the Florida Waterparks do not expect the same here - it is on a much smaller scale. Arriving early it is difficult to find any free sunbeds in the shade -",
          "really nice, but was really hot when we went so quite crowded and you need to get there opening time for a decent sunbed!",
          "Paradise for children! Just in 10 min by walking from Letoonia. A lot of water slides, even me and my husband had fun there!",
          "It is a beautiful aqua-park with such attractive slides, river, and waves, but too much people from outside RIXOS on Saturday and Sunday",
          "This is a very nice show, But it costs soooo much, especially if you plan to do more than watching the show like swimming with the dolphins or taking a photo with them, the photo is 25euros!!! During the show there are photographers taking pictures of your children, at the break",
          "It suits both the parents and their children, as the entertainment there is for all ages. beautiful place to be in, with many games and slides to go on.",
          "We only wanted to see how it looks like. With two small children was not possible to use this attraction.",
          "in 2010 i go to aqua fantasya hotel in kusadasi in turkey this hotel have a aqua park that is very nice and very safe but aqua park of rixos premium is not safe and my husband and me have several accident when we use it",
          "This was the main reason we booked the Rixos. I found the park itself to be old and unkempt. A distinct smell of mildew everywhere in the park.",
          "Stayed at the hotel linked to park so kids used every day, wouldn't bother travelling too far to use it. Staff dis-respectful of girls ogling my 12 yr old daughter, definitely not appropriate!!! Safety not up to great standards, ok if you are with them but teenagers do not want",

          "I really liked the Dolphinarium, but the Aquapark is as good as well. Many more slides here than the Dedeman Aquapark in Antalya.",
          "the day here was wonderfoll and the times is gone so fast .....very nice and funny place.",
          "not the best we have seen but it worth a visit if you have kids and like this kind of entertainment",
          "dolphinarium was great ,aqua park was good but u had to waste more than half an hour in a line for 1 game,",
          "not much to do for younger children, and several rides closed when waterpark only open to hotel residents",
          "It was a good show, but they really try to squeeze every euro out of you - options for photos, drinks, special extras etc. enjoyable, but bring your patience!",
          "we payed 25 poun to get in but thas was just for the water park, we only stayed for afew hours as we got bored! not many water slides to spend all day there. the water parks was good value for money but they wanted 100 euros for the dolphin show and i dint even ask how much it",
          "very expencive not much to see, we lost 100 euro's that they refused to give us back, there are about 80 steep steps down and the team dont really care",
          "This is a nice aqua park, but it could be better. The problem with this is, that the actual aquapark is awesome, but some technicalities are wrong. I have to wear shoes when I go into t he water because I get cut on the FLOOR OF THE POOLS. There are safety featues that are",
          "nice entertainment good day out people really nice and friendly",
          "We went out of season so not much open the place is not very clean and seats are falling apart so quite dangerous. the dolphins and walrus are superb just a shame there not kept in a nice environment.",
          "A lot of fun for you and your children. The cost to take a picture with the animal was not acceptable.",
          "Troy Aqua Park is adjacent to Rixos Premium Belek. We were staying at the hotel so it was free of charge for us for a maximum of two visits a day, but for others there was a US$55 fee. Hotel guests can walk to the entrance of the park when exiting the hotel\u2019s main building on",
          "Went here for a day out-thought it was expensive-only 13 slides and some of these were closed-in August!!!!The food was awful-yes they check your bags as you go in and take everything edible and drinkable out never to be seen again!It shuts at 4pm-half aday!!",

          "This water park looks old and has seen better days, not a full day out really. You can enter the park at 9am but the water park opens at 10am! So standing around waiting to get into the water for an hour with a 12 year old in the heat was not good. Not enough rubber rings but",
          "Your perception of this place will depend on what other water parks you may have been too and this is the problem that we had. When compared with other european water parks we have visited, this can only be described as an over priced, cramped park with dreadful facilities. We",
          "We booked this trip through our Thomas Cook rep. The park is mainly visited by Russian and German holiday makers, so English is rarely spoken. The park has a variety of water slides and a lazy river. The lazy river you cannot make your way round fully before running into the cue",

          "After an hour and a half of travelling around different hotels and to the park itself, we finally arrived at Troy. We were told that the 'watches' we were given was so that we could put money on to spend in the park. After believing this was a good idea, we put 100 lira on.",

          "I signed up for an all day tour that began at Dunden Waterfall. It's a nice waterfall but I felt it was slightly overrated. Perhaps would be nicer if seen from the boat on a boat tour or something but from above, you have a quick look, snap a picture and that's about it.",
          "Slightly overrated. Took a cruise along the Mediterranean with our tour group to see this. The weather was gorgeous. If your in the area, nice for a photo & to say you were there.",

          "Lovely place to visit. Cost was 60 liras to do 45 mins on boat. Good walk downhill and getting back to the old town is a good incline upwards. Can catch a taxi and tram is nearby also at the top.",

          "Don't miss it if you are in antalya Very nice paradise, beautiful landscape with big waterfall to escape the warm weather. Easy to come with public transportation",
          "This experience for us was spoilt by the fact that we went there with a Tour and a group of people of about 25. We went to only 1 view point, it was wet and crowded. We stayed about 20 minutes which is far from enough time to explore this scenic area. I would advise anyone to go",

          "We went from above not via the boat trip. It's nice to stay for about 20 / 30 minutes take some photos and that's it. It's also a kids friendly place. A lot to do around.",
          "If you dont have enough time in Antalya, DONT go there, cause you dont miss much. Its a waterfall with a park around, nothing more. The park and surrounding needs more life. Like bars, music and shops. Like Kaleici. We went there just before getting dark. Spent 15 minutes and",
          "A beautiful waterfall, you must take a boat to see how beautiful it is. Also you can swim in the sea! A nice view.",

          "We visited the waterfall as part of a day tour and it was definitely a beautiful view. There is a park for little ones and refreshments are also served in the area around the waterfall. I would definitely recommend!",
          "Hired the boat to do this trip with a few friends. Was a nice quick trip but thought they would give us snorkels etc but no you have to take your own the falls were nice and they stop the boats and let you get into the sea for a paddle but make sure you have some upper body",
          "It is good to pass by and stop at that place the view is great from there ...better to take a trip boat from Antalya marina to enjoy the view from the sea .",
          "I rode a bike here from the hotel along a lovely bike path. You can see them well from the shore, so you dont need the boat cruise.They are huge and impressive, with a cafe just near the top.",
          "Took the two hour boat trip to see the falls Did not realise that this included a five minute swim at the falls. The falls were nice to see. The coastline is spectacular.",
          "Made our own way here from our hotel swandor topkapi palace theres a bus stop outside getting there cross the road to the bus stop .. bus number LC07 was a bit daunting to be honest but had help with a young man who told the driver where we wanted to go and when we finally got",

          "Beautiful falls. We arranged a tour with a yellow cab for both lower and upper falls. Stunning views. Really beautiful.",

          "Good walking, nice park, beautiful view. A bit crowded and annoying photographers, but overall great experience.",
          "Antalya bucket list done right. Regardless the weather outside once you walk in pass the gates it switches to this pleasant breeze of fresh air. The pathways are built to take you around the park and back to the starting point while managing people traffic in a very smart way.",
          "We visited both the upper and lower Duden waterfalls in one day and it was a day well spent. Both waterfalls are a nature\u2019s beauty in their own unique ways. The upper ,located about 18 km from Antalya\u2019s center, is the one where small streams join and fall to form the beginning",
          "This place look magical \ud83d\ude0d Special at evening. My recommendation come to this place with your girlfriend / boyfriend \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0dP.S. I was alone \ud83d\ude05but I hope in future I will come to this place with someone",

          "Duden waterfalls feel like a mini-Niagra! The waterfall goes directly into the sea, an astounding sight. The view points are many, along a very well laid out public park. The tourist activity is not very heavy as tourists keep moving out soon. Be sure to click some photos.",
          "The waterfall is on 2 different grounds. First is Duden Park which is where the waterfall goes into the sea, it's free and nice if the weather is good to let the kids have a run around. Not much to see though and the men with parents are real pests! 2nd site is Duden waterfalls",
          "Small waterfalls , may spend 30 minutes around the area , u need tickets for 15 lira again very small falls",

          "Was there last year with my family, we had fun there although it was hot and the place was crowded. It\u2019s a nice place to take a lot of pictures with your beloved ones. There\u2019s a small restaurant there, you can also buy beautiful souvenirs from a small shop there. Everyone",
          "It\u2019s quite a small waterfall but a popular tourist spot in Antalya. I wasn\u2019t blown away but it\u2019s something you do while in the city. It\u2019s a good photo spot and the history around the waterfall is the most interesting part. The area is well looked after and there\u2019s a nice",
          "Visited here on a whim with my wife when touring Antalya on a scooter. Well worth the run out to the outskirts. For entrance of under a pound you enter this delightful verdant park of natural spectacular waterfalls with pleasant pathways, places to sit and local food/drink",

          "Wonderful Place. You can make superb pictures. I would have loved to get more information about the site, guides that explain everything. Also if somebody can tell the shops outside not to Rob tourists... We are all going to buy some souvenirs, lets make it in a hospitable way.",

          "Must visit! You don\u2019t need any guide to see this place. It is natural waterfall, where water fishes out of ground instead of coming from any mountain glacier. Worth the visit",
          "Very good place to visit with childeren The waterfall was amazing and really enjoyed But toilets need to be enhanced",
          "A trip round the bay on a traditional style boat was well worth the money and the time. Crew were welcoming and enteraining The waterfall was a little disappointing due to the small amount of water , but must look spectacular after there has been some rain . Would definitely do",

          "What a treat to go for a late afternoon walk and encounter these falls at the end of a river lined with friendly caf\u00e9s and little eateries. It would have even nicer to have a bench to sit on overlooking the falls to just enjoy their beauty for a bit longer.",

          "Very cheap to get to, either by taxi or bus. Beautiful waterfall, with different viewing areas, inside a public park. Would recommend visiting in the evening (around 8pm) as there are less people and the small LED lights in the rocks are on, making it seem all that more",

          "Was wondering around Lara and came across the Duden falls on a hot summer's day. We went around 12:45 and it wasn't very busy, but it was hot as the area is flat and there are not many shaded spaces. We took pictures of the upper falls, the lower falls is accessed by boat. There",

          "The waterfalls themselves are truly beautiful, some of the best in Turkey. However, expect to be visiting with many other tourists and to pay an entrance fee. It has a circular path as well you can follow through the park. Be sure to go up into the caves behind the waterfall!!",
          "If you want to spend a couple of hours in a relaxing place away from the heat of the street then come here, price at the gates is cheap and the water is lovely. There are some caves just behind the water too. You will not be able to touch the water from the fall as it is",

          "Went on a speed boat to see the waterfalls. Captain was very friendly and took us into the caves and for a shower under the falls. We could have gone swimming as well but opted not too. Did parasailing on the way back. Very tranquil and relaxing. Teenage daughter was too scared",
          "I visited as part of a Thomas Cook tour, the waterfall is beautiful, it\u2019s the largest waterfall in the world that falls into the sea and definitely worth photographing.

          "To reach the site you need to walk for a couple of hours on a steep path but it's really worth every step. Due to the impervious location, it is very difficult to completely restore the site but what is there is very well preserved from the necropolis to the theater from where",
          "Another great historic spot and there are lots of ways to get to see this attraction from Antalya. Turkey has history in spades.",
          "It feels like a long trek to the top, where the ruins are located but anyone should be able to make it in 30 to 45 minutes, while taking short breaks. The ruins themselves are very interesting, as they are spread along the walking paths until you reach the top. The view itself",
          "Here's a bit of ancient history you can walk on and touch without spending a fortune, no crowds either",
          "The most beautiful place to visit. An area where you can have a good time with family or friends. Have a good trip to everyone.",
          "A must visit site if you are in the area, the Amphitheatre is superb and the nature exceptional. No steep climbs, just steady and the views from the top are excellent.",
          "Good park for hiking , really worthy to visit this place, save and clean forest Highly recommend!!!!",
          "Now you can't miss out on this mountain and it's massive scenery! It's breathtaking and beautiful. Don't go up by yourself and have a few liters of water with you. Loved it. No flip flops, use good shoes.",
          "Hiking in Termessos was the highlight of my 4 days in the Antalya region! Absolutely impressive collection of ruins of ancient civilization(s) set in the amazing landscape of Mount G\u00fcll\u00fcck national park. Best way to get there is with a car and visit in the morning. We spent",
          "Well worth the trip from Antalya, incredible to see in person. Hard to believe how it was possible to build so far in the past.",
          "This is one of my favorite ancient Greek sites in Turkey. It is large, has lots of intact ruins, there is exercise involved with the whole adventure, and best of all, there are scant crowds. It is a bit of the beaten path, but it is worth the extra time to discover this gem. The",
          "A must see place to visit if you\u2019re holidaying in Antalya. The hike up to the top had some scary moments considering I had my son strapped to me - but I did it! The views going up and at the final destination were breathtaking.",
          "So if you wanna use public transport - To get there from Antalya using public transport take the Otagar direction tram from downtown, 2 lira about 20 mins (you need to buy a swipe card at the yellow kiosk), and then walk right around the U shaped bus terminal to the minibus.",
          "Visited as part of an organised visit by Millenium Travel. This company had been our pick up from airport. Our rep took the four of us up the stony rough terraine to the top of the mountain where Termessos ruins are. Definately not suitable for young children or push chairs!!",
          "We visited Termessos because it was close to our place. We were overwhelmed with size and beauty. We were lucky because there was almost nobody during our visit. The views are superb, all stones, crumble buildings and the amphitheater are amazing. I'm really surprised this is",
          "Its a bit of a drive out from Antalya but worth it for the views on the way up to Termessos. When you get there its quite a steep climb up and unfortunately it was cool and misty and grey on our visit. We glimpsed the amphitheatre between the low cloud and mist but it did make",

          "Visited over 30 ancient cities on a recent visit to Turkey and this was one of the highlights. Amazing location on top of a steep mountain. Bit of a steep walk to get to the ruins from the carpark. Visited in early September and it was very quiet - very few people around. Many",

          "We hired a taxi for the day and haggled out a price , for myself and my husband to be driven from Lara beach to Termessos. We preffered than the rushed pace of being in a group and having to sit on a coach. The drive as quick and once we got there, we hiked up for about 20-30",
          "Fantastic Experience. You should expect a minimum of 2 hrs for this trip which takes place in a rather challenging terrain. Restoration has not begun in the area, so you are seeing the ruins as they are. Went there with 3 grumpy teenagers, who ended up loving the walk",
          "We went to this site using a travel agency for a day tour. The experience was great. The guide explained the whole history background therefore it was quite interesting. We spent several hours over there. Take proper shoes as you will have to walk in the forest.",
          "minimally restored ancient site in beautiful setting, requires good walking shoes, reasonable fitness as climbing involved. There in hot weather so needed plenty of drinking water. The ancient sarcophagi at the bottom are incredible",
          "Termessos is truly every bit as majestic and awe-inspiring as touted to be, particularly the half-ruined amphitheater against the backdrop of a mountain peak. Do visit in the late afternoon when the (summer) heat is less oppressive and the sun is shining on the amphitheater",
          "Read about Termessos before going and you will appreciate it even more! It's truly unique...about 20 minutes strenuous hike each way and took us about 1.5 hours total with a 5-yr old boy. May wasn't too hot but I would recommend bringing water especially if see it June-August.",
          "At no cost, 5 tl, visit the ruines here. The climb to the main site is a pretty steep climb, but after that it's all fine. The ruines are in such a good condition that with very little fantasy you can imagine how this city must have been, and it must have been jaw-dropping!",

          "This was a wonderful trip guided by Uraz from Cicerone Travel. Termessos is unique in that it is a huge Roman site 1000 metres up in the mountains. The Amphitheatre is stunning and the highlight of the trek. You must wear appropriate clothing & bring lots of water if it is a hot",
          "We hadn\u2019t appreciated what an impregnable location Termessos was in. It is in the mountains and built on the extremely steep slopes. There were quite a number of ruins but even the archeologists had been unable to determine what many had been used for. You have to walk for about",
          "Worth a visit as truly amazing. It was a very hot day so remember to wear comfortable shoes and take a water bottle.",
          "Fantastic archeologicalRoman site dating from 3-5 century, with earlier culture , with ruins left and well preserved, with nature starting to reclaim parts. Amazing Arena on edge of mountain. My tour guide from Tailormade Turkey in Antalya was great. Included picnic lunch eaten",
          "Solymos tours took us here for a brilliant hike and history lesson. The reward for the walking efforts was enormous, the Teatro is remarkable, scenic, passive, inspiring etc. Really worth the effort and a guide like Omar made it perfect.",
          "About 30 km from city center, Termessos may seem as a quick visit destination, you may however need to spare at least 6 hours to visit this marvelous place. After 7 km of uphill drive you reach a parking lot from where you start hiking up to hill passing by tombs and graves of",

          "I always found Termessos so magical. I ended up sitting at the theatre surrounded by the clouds 2 times! Beautiful place.",
          "I recommend going early in the morning to beat the heat and sun if going in the Summer. Pack a backpack with food, ample water, snacks, and wear appropriate shoes and socks. Use the restroom before the hike, no bathrooms on the hiking trail or at the ruins site. Bathroom at the",

          "As for my trip, I was from the Dosemealti. Take bus No.506 then take off at Termesessos Caddesi. Walked 2km to a highway road (you can do hitchike 100%. Only one way) and walked to a ticket office 300m(?). Arrived at a ticket office 14:30pm and paid 5TL for entrance ticket.",
          "Yes it was a hike, a rocky one. But so beautiful. Our 5 and 7 year olds did a great job. We ate our packed lunch at the amphitheater. Be sure to take water along. Due to timing we didn't hike up to the firehouse, and our friends that did said we missed the best view ever!",
          "Reading guidebooks just gave no clue as to how totally stunning this site is. The mountainous amphitheatre looking across to a mountain backdrop just spectacular. We had over 5 hours there but that wasnt long enough to check out the southern necropolis or the outer regions of",
          "A visit to Termessos can be a nice one-day trip from Antalya. At least 3-4 hours are needed to fully get the feel of it, it is a vast area. After paying the 5-lira entrance fee you'll drive the 9 km long narrow, winding road to the parking lot. Then you can start the hike",
          "Termessos ruins are about 30 km from Antalya. The entrance fee is very cheap (5 Lira), I think not very many people go there. The ruins are at about 1500 meters in altitude, and are very scattered, so it is a combination of seeing ruins and hiking. I recommend taking plenty of",
          "Top on the Hill not difficult to climb but sure not a place for handicap persons or small Children. But when you reach the City you will understand why you are there a specially Theater looking from this high to lowland amasing View. And ancient Water Stores the Technic they use",
          "One of my favorite photos of my husband is in the theater here with the clouds at his feet. This is a fantastic site, one so high up that Alexander the Great said never mind as he was marching forward.",
          "All city ruins stay in a fascinating nature. You can go trekking to the top of the mountain. Very peaceful with bird hummings. Do it! :)",

          "The city is very well preserved, maybe the best preserved among the greek cities around Antalya. The surrounding walls, the amphitheatre, the graveyard are all still intact. From the amphitheatre's wall there is a breathtaking view of all the surrounding area. It should be an",
          "Termessos full of history, is a must visit. Its archaeological remains, combined with mediterranean vegetation and mountains is a combination of extreme beauty. Termessos does fly our imagination, such is the quality of conservation of the monuments of the Roman epoch reveals",
          "If you like to walk, Termessos is a great mix of amazing scenery and panorama on the valley and the remnants of a beautiful old city. The theater and the tomb of one of Alexander the Great General are a must see. The walk is abt 3 hours, do not forget to bring liters of water",
          "Really cool place to walk around. Some bits quite step and rocky. Good shoes will be needed. Amazinf views up the top. Signage and people there on entrance to guide you for the walk.",
          "People on here are being extremely dramatic about the path/hike, of course it helps to be fit and of course you need to be steady on your feet but like anything that involves steep paths and rocks you use your common sense and wear suitable footwear and be careful. The walk to",
          "The hike to the ruins will be tough for kids younger than 9 or so in the hot summer months. However, the hike is worth it. The sweeping views are breathtaking. The road up to the site was twisting but good and easy to drive. The famous theater set against the mountainous",
          "You cannot visit with children. You must walk very very much after you get off the car. There is no way...",
          "Hate to tell how great it is-- because lots of its charm is that it isn't crowded. Its 100% in original condition of when it was abandoned 1300 years ago.",
          "Cam here with my wife learned few things about the area , but I guess its not our kind of entertainment .",
          "A long climb in hot weather and difficult underfoot but well worth it when you see the wonderful amphitheatre!",
          "I know some people would like more government enhancements, better pathways or more complete ruins, but we LOVED how untouched this site is. No excavation, no restorations. It was unlike any other ruin we have been to. It wasn't just about a pile of rocks in a drop-dead gorgeous",

          "Things which may be hepful: \u2022 Own transport is preferable for getting to this site due to its remote location. \u2022 Entrance fee is a reasonable 5 Turkish Lira per adult (May 2016). \u2022 Plenty of free parking once you drive the 9km (on winding mountain roads) from the ticket office",
          "We both enjoyed the uphill walk. We had packed water and a lunch that we ate at the amphitheatre. The amphitheatre is nestled high with a peak close to it. We really recommend the visit.",
          "It was a amazinggg discover during our Antalya tour , over 1100m. I love it. Do it with a car, if not take the dolmus from otogar to Korkuteli, take off in termassos road., from there , there is a taxi or 9km walk .. Absolutely trekking shoe's u need.",
          "A must for all interested in the fabulous history of Turkey-simply stunning! The amphitheatre is one of the finest anywhere.",
          "Definitly the most amazing ruins I have ever seen. Breathtaking atmosphere and landscape. If in Antalya, must see!",
          "I'll summarize this in a few words: MUST VISIT! The amphitheater is a place that will take your breath away... so close to heaven! If you're not a fan of trekking and watching landscapes & antique cultures, you can skip it.",
          "one of my absolute favourits in Southern Turkey! I love to walk up from the parking area and then find a old city on the top of the mountain, a big theatre with a stunning view until the sea on the other side!",
          "Stunningly beautiful Graeco-Roman complex 4000 feet up. Not excavated but theatre is intact and has phenomenal views .Hire a car for 80 Euros 2 days",
          "It was great hiking all the way although I had my 2 years old son, who I had to carry, and my non athletic wife who had to rest in every chair, but once we up it was great, take care the weather is really cold up there",
          "We have visited Termessos on several occasions and never failed to wonder how this place was constructed. It is a rough climb over a rocky path but definitely worth it, our golfing friends, used their putters as walking sticks. Make sure that you read the history behind this",
          "This ancient site is in the mountains near Antalya. Visiting this site is not for the ordinary visitor. The trail is undeveloped and steep in several sections so wear comfortable walking shoes or boots. But the climb is worth the view which from the top is fantastic. Be sure",
          "As others have noted, Termessos is an unrestored site. Very interesting to walk into, nearly get lost. The sights are impressive but the walk do not suit elders and tour groups so it's pretty amazing. I took a dolmus up to the intersection, after which a 10 kilometer ride is",
          "for history buffs, this is a must ! if you came to Antalya only for R&R, you will surely miss one of the most gorgeous views in all Turkey.",

          "We hired a car to get to Termessos and we are glad that we made the trip. It's well worth exploring the site and basically impossible to get there without a car. 9km walk uphill from the main road. The theatre is the highlight as it is in such good condition and in an impressive",
          "Truly enjoyed great views beautiful place and plenty of history. it was a bit too small so expect to spend more than 40mins to an hour",
          "We have visited the theatre but is not really interesting. We have seen better and more interesting once. But it was included in our program and we have visited it.",
          "Worth making the effort to get there but allow at least three hours for the visit. Wear sturdy shoes, it's a tough climb",
          "A magnificent ancient city some way out of Antalya. A long and interesting walk. Not for the faint hearted, elderly or disabled.",
          "What a beautiful site! There is so much to see that you had best allow at least three hours here. The information available at the site is limited so do your homework first. The site is on the top of a mountain so be prepared for a bit of uphill walking, but it is well worth",
          "THIS IS NOT SUITABLE IF YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY WALKING. These ruins are amazing. You have to drive approx 5miles to the car park. You can do this as a coach trip or tour. Once at the car park you have about a one mile walk uphill on a rocky, shaley, unkept path to get to the ruins.",
          "But once you do (and that's over a dozen hairpin bends in the car, and then a half hour hike / scramble to get to the top) it's worth it to see the theatre and look down on the mediterranean sea.",
          "a magical hike up thru the forest to this breath taking site. quite well marked ruins are you go but the hilite is the theatre at the top. we all marked it at on of the most romantic in turkey",
          "We were on a long driving trip though Turkey and were a little burned out on ruins but we decided to stop. There was only one car in the lot when we arrived so we assumed that the site was not going to be much of anything. How wrong we were. You can look up the details of",
          "After a short drive from Antalya you arrive at the car park. You have about a 30 minute walk up the mountain to the site. While the ruins themselves are interesting the Outdoor Theatre is by far the number one thing to see. Just to sit there, mostly alone you can wonder about",
          "We have been to ancient sites all around the world, including Egypt but this was by far the most amazing adventure. We booked a taxi from Kaleici with 3hr wait & return for around 60TL. Incredible value. Could have done with more time but will certainly return one day. It's",
          "Such a pleasant surprise! Even if you understand nothing about archeology (like us), it is still a MUST!",
          "Spectacular! Still wild, almost left as is.. with little repair... With hardly anyone around- we felt like we we discovered the ruins! It's quite a hike to get there though - we opted to drive from Antalya - once on site past the gates, it's a 9Km ride up the mountain on",
          "A very well kept area - 20TL - and a huge 20,000 capacity amphitheatre to wander around. Lots of ruins behind the main attraction too, but certainly worth going to if you're visiting Antalya!",
          "Just go and look a great experience. Sensible shoes! and take a drink with you, probably too hot in the day unless your out of season",
          "Many times the most worthy things requires more sacrifice. Termessos is one of them. First, you have to drive about 25kms from Antalya, then take a detour for 9km in a very narrow road with several curves and finally walk uphill for about 30 to 40 minutes. But it all worth the",
          "A bit of a hike as most ruins are in Turkey but definitely worth seeing. Great views from the top of the mountain.",
          "the original appearance of the ancient ruins,without too much tourists, because go the hilltop of the way that is a little hard, so automatic filtering of some tourists, you can quietly enjoy the ancient city.....the view of the hilltop is awesome.It is well worth a trip.",
          "Fairly short drive from Antalya over wide and quite good roads, slightly slippery on some bends, until the turn-off to Termessos, then usual narrow steep roads to the National Park. Almost deserted, apart from the wild piglets which the Ranger has been feeding and adopted (we",
          "This is a must see. Once you make your way up the climb you will see an absolute treasure of a city that hasn't been touched and won't be. The theatre is a treasure on the top of a cliff and the views magnificent.",
          "We visited this site on the wayby self drve car from Antalya to Pamukale, it is a nice break , 9 km from the highway. There are very few visitors and it is quite a steep walk, but worth the view. you will alone in the old theatre. That is really great . See if you can spot",
          "Amazing, This is part of your visit of Baumakali, amazing place , worth going up to see, it is 2 minutes by shuttle bus from the cleopatra bath. it costs around 2-3 lira per person, must see",
          "I really hate fighting through crowds to see ruins, no matter how spectacular. (In fact, I'm not the biggest fan of ruins in general.) But I loved Termessos: a quick hike to get the blood flowing and to scare off the masses, and then beautiful, well-preserved ruins with",
          "Amazing nature, could be cold in September when we came, so bring your raincoat or at least an umbrella and a jacket. Get geared up for better climbing experience, caused it's a long ascending way toward the ruins. Slippery, so wear a proper pair of shoes or you may twit your",
          "good place to visit but no need to spend whole day in this activity better to have Pamukkale Tour from Antalya :)",
          "The theater view was the best among all the theaters in Turkey. However, it required some tough hiking to get there. Wear your sneakers and bring enough water. It can be hard during a hot day.",
          "Very nice to visit, easily spend a couple of hours, and take pictures. Spacious and climbing up steps is involved",
          "Great site to visit, albeit with a bit of walking involved. I have travelled a fair bit in Europe and Termessos is so far unique amongst all the sites I've visited in terms of the level of preservation and freedom the average visitor has to explore them. As the site has only",
          "You can spend all day in this place. It was unforgettable visit for me. You can see the traces of an ancient settlement in the mountains. Even the graves was amazing. The amphitheater on the hill has an incredible view. You need see this place before you die.",
          "Very nice archeological sit on the top of the mountain. It took me a while to reach it comming from Antalya but it worth it. The entrance fee is very low, only 5 lira per person. At the entrance i encountered a museum worker wich was speaking english( Very rare unfortunately ).",
          "In the morning \u2013 after we left the Ninova Pension \u2013 we took the new tramline to Antalya\u2019s otogar (bus station). We left our baggage at the otogar at the left-luggage (12 TL), and we caught immediately a minibus to Termessos. The ride was short, just 30-40 minutes, and the driver",
          "We traveled to Termesos and we were stunned by the beauty of nature. Is worth to come and see this place.",
          "After going to Ephesus, this place is heaven. No crowds. Only 5 TL for entry. And mostly untouched. Wander off the beaten path, there is so much to see. Absolutely phenomenal views! There are lots of ruins in Turkey, but few in the mountains! If you're up to it, the climb to",
          "Termessos is really worth a visit if you are near Antalya. The site us superb and the location of the old theatre is simply amazing. Difficult to imagine that the ruins are more than 2,000 years old.",

          "This fortress was unconquered for several centuries, even Alexander the Great failed. After the ascent by foot I can imagine why....So put on your trekking shoes and be prepared for a tortuos path designed for goats and not for humans.... You will be rewarded by a grandiose view",
          "Good remains of the old theatre. Entry \u00a34.00 per person. You can walk around the stone seating area and see the old columns and stonework. Quite a height from the top and you can see the east beach in the distance.",
          "Remarkable Hellenic site set high in the mountains. the only place Alexandra the great was unable to conquer. Once you have walked the 3 km trail from the car park you will better understand why. Fascinating and beautiful.",
          "It is a 30 mins climb from the carpark. So be careful. Be fit and preferably no toddlers. The trek route is not smooth and littered with pebbles so chances of fall / injury increases. Good footwear is a must. Once at the top, not to be missed is the breathtaking theatre. At the",
          "This is an archaeologist heaven. Easy to reach by car, even cheaper if you rent a car instead of going with a tour. It was worth to spend some hours walking around the ruins and enjoying the scenery. From the car par is only a 15min walk to the old city, but it takes some time",
          "The theater here is amazing! I prefer this theater better than the Aspendos one. Here you are also hiking inside the ancient city. The only problem is there is no public transportation to get here. I took a taxi which cost me 150 tl, the driver wait me for 3 hours and than took",

          "Bit of a drive but worth it, there was no-one there when we went, we hired a car from the hotel and drove from Belek area, about an hour or so, several women selling scarfs will hassle you a bit but as its probably their only income maybe buy some..",

          "Beautiful hidden ruins near Antalya. You need a car to reach them (at least if you want to visit them the way we did), but it is worth it. First you have to drive up a narrow road for 9 km and then walk for another hour on paths with loose stones (So take sturdy shoes!) but then",
          "The drive from the city to the national park eventually climbs a beautiful mountain with many Zion-like views. Once in the park there was nowhere to purchase water, so bring some for your hike. In view of the parking area is Hadrian's arch, so don't miss it! The climb to the",
          "Visit Termessos, but definitely do the hike to the top. The views are spectacular combined with the amphitheater it is definitely worth the work out!",
          "Amazing setting amongst the mountains, the amphitheater was my highlight. I like how it has been left to nature's fate with little or no restoration so you'll find yourself climbing over parts of the fallen walls and buildings. It's a bit of walk up from the car park so make",

          "the road to the Termessos is amazing - narrow, dangerous and very thrilling. The breathtaking views make up for it. After parking, we hiked for about two hours. The colosseum was nice. Don't expect any health-hazard warnings here. Definitely recommend.",
          "Remote ruins in an incredible setting. Difficult to visit by public transport...but can be done if you are willing to walk 9km (uphill) or hope for a lift. Best for those who enjoy an adventure more than an easy tour...for that, try Ephesus instead.",
          "Nice and piece full place to visit with almost no tourists (we met like 4 when we went there). I'm giving 4 starts as they don't seem to care about the place very well so at some point of time it will be probably all just ruins.",
          "The hike is medium to difficult, but once you get into the ruins of the city, it is all worth it. Definitely wear good shoes and bring lots of water. We also brought a small lunch to eat in the theatre, which gave us time to soak up how beautiful it was. There werent many people",
          "After almost 45 minutes walking on hill side we got to this amazing place. Although it was mostly ruined by earthquake, still has a lot of thing to see. Specially the stone arches without any cement between. I wonder how its citizen's daily life was, because it so difficult to",
          "We had to decide between Termessos, Perge and Aspendos. I was attracted to the fact that Termessos was less crowded and further out. The drive here was fairly straight forward. (I don't know if we would come here with public transport. Seems too complicated). We paid 5 Lira",
          "Definitely need good shoes for this one. Good 1-2hr hike up and down. Beautiful ruins esp the amphitheatre. So peaceful. Carry enough water, sunscreen and hats..can get pretty hot.",
          "Very thanks to the great person Mr. Oktay Altuntas who helped me and my family. He is very cooperative. He is rich in knowledge of every things related to professional issues of tourism. He is a human, has the ability to attract people and help them. He is always looking for",
          "My parents and I hiked up to see the ruins, although some areas are a little unstable if you have the right footwear and are careful as you go it is a very enjoyable experience. We saw little to no tourists while we were at the ruins which made it just that little bit more",
          "I do have top mountineering experience but in no way recommend this for mortals. The grade and trail maintenance is poor, rocks and ruins are slippery, even when dry. Additionally, I found the ampitheatre much smaller than expected, even smaller the the roman ruins in Lyon.",
          "An amazing place even by Turkish archeology standards. It has nature, charm, history, ambience, stunning views.  Highlight is the tomb of Alcetas, one of Alexander's generals.  To get there from Antalya using public transport take the Otagar direction tram from downtown, 2 lira",
          "A drive off the main road then about a 30 minute walk to the top, which is so worth it. Spectacular views and great ruins that are just left as time has passed. The amphitheatre at the back is stunning with a great mountainous back drop. So glad we went here would recommend.",
          "Despite the cold and rain it was wonderful to be able to wander freely around the ruins of this ancient city. The terrain is rough but manageable and it is well worth the climb when you come to the Theatre in its dramatic setting.",
          "This ruined ancient city is well worth the drive and the hike. Be sure to wear appropriate footwear for a half mile hike up a rocky path, and for scrambling over the tumbled ruins of this site. Be sure to visit the theater and the necropolis by the parking lot. Give yourself",
          "We pretty much had the place to ourselves and it was a real gift hiking around this immense historic site which seems to float in the sky. It is virtually untouched. What a gem. If you like ancient history, geography and walking I highly recommend visiting the ruins of Termessos.",
          "It is about a half hour hike from the parking lot up to the ruins but really worth it. This was apparently the only location in the empire of Alexander the Great that he failed to conquer \u2013 you\u2019ll understand why when you climb up to it! The natural beauty of the surrounding",
          "The lovely walk up the mountain to the site is rewarding in itself. You should be in minimal good health to enjoy this site. Wear sturdy shoes, hat and sun block and carry water with you. If you go before 10:30-11:00am, you will have the place to yourself. The theater is",

          "Termessos is really a wonderfull place. Located in the mountain, you can enjoy at the same time a very pleasant trekking and a great Antique site. The amphitheater is marvelous and unique. We can call Termessos, the \"Machu Pichu\" of the Mediterranean area :)",
          "My all time favorit in this area. It is a combination of a really nice(little bit long) Walk and a great view. If you have fysicall problems i would maybe not recommand. Once you arrive above just enjoying the view and the tranquillity, it is amazing",
          "9km highway on a very scenic drive up the mountain. hike 3km further uphill in tough trails to various ruins. the amphitheater is on a cliff with another mountain top as backdrop. a little like machu picchu peru.no crowds. Alexander the Great didn't conquer this place.",
          "We were glad to have on hiking boots and our poles in hand and we explored this extraordinary site, and perhaps this is why others avoid, but what a treat to have this terrific site almost to ourselves. In our three hours we didn't see more than ten other explorers which meant",
          "The city that Alexander the Great failed to take is a trip well worth while. It takes a bit of effort but the views over the old greek theatre are simply incomparable. While there are other more complete ruins in Turkey none are situated like this. Some reviewers complained",
          "Termessos is an ancient ruined town high up in the mountains near Antalya. It is easy to reach by main road, then a smaller winding road and finally by a fifteen minute walk up a steep path to the ruins of the old city. The views are amazing and the atmosphere and sheer beauty",

          "These ruins are over 2000 years old and are surrounded by stunning nature. The park is easily accessible by car, approximately 30 km from Antalya. There are virtually no crowds and you can walk amid the rubble and imagine how this ancient city looked prior to being toppled by an",
          "This is today what it was to go to Tulum Mexico 30 years ago. No barriers, no security, no information to speak of, but total freedom to roam about the ruins. Impressive but at the same time sad that 80% of the site is just tumbled stones and structures. The Theater",
          "Absolutely beautiful, particularly on the day me and my husband visited - it was warm and sunny but not swelteringly hot. The ruins were amazing and the views were breathtakingly scenic. I would recommend very comfortable clothing and shoes, as well as water and snacks. We",

          "The ruins were amazing. A bit of a climb but well worth it. The day we climbed to the top the fog rolled in which just added to the whole atmosphere of the place. The stadium is unbelievable. Make the effort and go",
          "Out of season, with not so high expectances after having visited several other ruins in the area, we were stunned by this places beauty and mighty impressed of what they did 2,5 thousand year ago! I don't think I have ever seen such a nice work in stone. The TIYATRO were",
          "It\u2019s really really amazing; the one can get the advantage of the scenery of the mountains and also a beautiful lost city on such elevation. This is the number of attraction I loved the most in Antalya. It would be better if you could get a professional guide to inform you about",
          "This was a truly beautiful visit right in the middle of the national park. Yes it's a strenuous climb, but it's well worth it to see all the ruins but particularly the theatre built in to the mountain. Amazing views",

          "Amazing place. This beautiful old city was devastated by earthquakes about 2000 years ago, after a history of some 3000 years as city of kings and aristocracy. Alexander the Great had conquered all the places nearby but gave up here - too steep a mountain and the inhabitants",
          "We really enjoy our visit to Termessos, it was better then we expected. We went during tourist low season so there weren't many people around at all which made it even more magical for us. We took our baby of 7 months in the baby carrier but it was a struggle for me with the",
          "If you love climbing hills and roman ruins, this place will not disappoint you. It is also very cheap for entrance fee. We were there during winter/low season which we found was the best time to be there. Not too hot or too cold, and not tOo many people at the site neither.",
          "This marvel of an ancient city will reward everyone, who puts in the effort to climb the steep, rocky pathway, with tremendous views, well-preserved ruins and a strong feeling peacefulness. You literally feel as if you were exploring the unexplored, since Termessos is so",

          "If you don't mind walking/climbing up a rocky path you should not miss this place. It is one of the most amazing sites I have ever seen. An ancient city in the forest on a mountain. That describes it the best I guess. You have to see for yourself. But keep in mind that it can be",
          "the antic ruins are beautiful, and the site is amazing. It's a lot of fun and wonder to search in the shrub and discover gates, tombs, etc. The overdrawn ruins are also beautiful, the theatre is wonderfull, I thougt I was going o cry... Beware, if you'e curious and if you want",

          "Getting to Termessos is not the easiest journey to undertake, either a taxi or private transport is required but it is well worth the effort. The site is high up on the mountainside and although it was a warm sunny day (early Nov) it was a little chilly and although we are",
          "Certainly the ruins at Ephesus are more impressive. I would probably say the same about Aphrodisias and Permukkale. But the ruins of the city of Termossos offer a feature that the more well-known and more heavily visited sites cannot match. These ruins have not been excavated",
          "We had a wonderful time on a self-guided hike through the ruins at Termessos. We rented a car in Antalya and with some guidance, had no difficulty finding Termessos. We enjoyed a strenuous hike through the ruins. What to expect: There is a 5 TL fee at the entrance to the park,",
          "The site has not been restored and that's what makes it so charming. We were the only group there for the day - the cruise ships don't go there. The theater is in a very breathtaking location at the very top of the mountain. Don't rush this visit. I could have easily spent",

          "Having already visited Ephessos on this trip it could have been archaeology overkill, but Termessos is definitely worth a visit in its own right. The site is extensive and has many examples of the ancient architecture that always makes us marvel at how they constructed these",
          "Termessos Roman age city ruins high in mountain were absolutely the best attraction during our Turkey week. Location of the amphitheatre is just amazing and views unbelievable. Almost everything in the city ruins is as it has probably already feen for many hundreds of years,",
          "Set high in the mountains the ruins are not the best preserved we've visited but well worth the tough climb up for the beautiful setting with stunning views. Be warned there is a lot of scrambling over big lumps of rock and broken masonry and coming down is fairly hard on",
          "Have been to this place on many occasions as there is so much to see. The ruins of the city of Termessos are scattered about the mountainside - amphitheatre, baths, agora temple. You will need to spend a number of hours to make the most of this trip. Take plenty of water as this",
          "Not for the faint hearted, as you drive 9km off the main road up the mountains and another. 3 k by food. Surfaces are very uneven, so you need to be fit. Great views and worth the visit.",

          "We travelled here independently by car and it was a real treat to visit such an amazing site without crowds of other tourists. No buses appear to come here, which is a real advantage. It is quite a climb up to the beginning of the site, but well worth the effort. There is a lot",

          "It takes a bit of getting to but it is well worth it and the best part is that it isn't crowded. If you go in the summer months as I did (it was 41c the day I visited) go as early as you can. Most of the path is covered in shade but it is still a hike. Do your research so you",
          "On our 2013 holiday in Antalya we decided to visit the ruins of Termessos north-west of Antalya and what an amazing trip. This old ancient city is located up in the mountains around 1000 to 1200 meters above sea level. There are many well preserved buildings but most of the city",
          "Main thing to see here is the theatre. It is about a 25 minute walk uphill on a gravel path to reach from car park but well worth it. But if not very good on your feet would not recommend. Does get very busy with tour groups so if not on a tour then either go really early or",

          "Make sure you read as much information before you visit. An easy drive from Antalya.....pay at the entrance and head up the winding road to a large car park. Take some food and drinks and enjoy a picnic. Stunning site...the ruins have been subjected to some 'plundering' over",

          "Termessos is, put quite simply, the most atmospheric and incredible site imaginable! The paths are rough, steep and stony in places, so prepare to climb, but the rewards are well worth it! If you follow the signposts to the necropolis, you will climb all the way to the top of",
          "If you plan to go here, go early so you reach the sight before all the tourist busses arrive. To reach Termessos you have to drive up a narrow road with no guardrails : be aware ! The climb to the top is an effort worth your while once you have reached the theater. To sit there",
          "Termessos is a great spot near Antalya. Well you need a car, or a taxi (price is 125TL retour from Antalya city center) to get there, but it's worth. The view is really awesome!!",
          "Be prepared to clamber over rocks & through undergrowth. This is a real \"Indiana Jones\" experience - it is so atmospheric and you feel as if you are discovering it yourself! Take a picnic & have it sitting in the amphitheatre with a fabulous view of the mountains. We stayed 5",
          "we were very lucky to have gorgeous weather and spent a couple of hours walking around the ruins would recomend if you are in the area",
          "we were very lucky to have the place to ourselfs being out of season would recomend to everyone to see :)",
          "We loved this place because we love hiking, it is important to understand that it is in the middle of mountain and completely wild, impressive but could be a choc for some people waiting for place like Ephese. We loved it but any way after some days it will not my best memory,",
          "Rent a car, drive up in the mountains and enjoy an amazing day among ruins and nature. Perfect getaway from the busy resort. Suitable for all ages, but you need to be fit, as it involves a lot of walking. The entrance fee to the National Park (where the ruins of Termessos are)",
          "We stopped at Termessos on our drive from Antalya to Cirali. We prepped our girls (9 and 11) in advance about the long hike up. The entrance fee was only 5 TL and the kids were free. Make sure to ask for a map of the site at the first gate, they are 5 TL. We did not get a",
          "We rented a car to go there ( it's I think the easiest and cheapest way if you travel with friends). The road was winding and without crash barriers. You have to be fit to go there, because you have to climb to see ruins. Place was awesome with surrounding mountains and",
          "Quiet place, no coaches. 6 miles up a twisty hill to a car park. Entrance fee at the bottom is about \u00a31.80 per person (2014) and after parking the walk up to the site is 1 mile or 20 mins. Views are fantastic.",
          "If you like your ancient ruins, and I do, you will love Termessos! Please be aware that this is not the sort of place to go to if you dont like steep climbs, or walks off the beaten track or clambering over rock...or pillars for that matter, but if you are the whole experience",
          "I was persuaded to take three other guests to see these ruins and we had a wonderful day for it. You do need to be fairly fit and agile to appreciate all the ruins as they are spread over a large area which is not level. You have a 20 minute uphill walk from the carpark which",
          "You have to rent a car to drive there, it takes about an hour from the city centre. Be prepared to walk up hill and rough and steep parts, but it is stunning and incredible discovery of Roman times. Especially the huge stone carved, an average room size Roman Tombs are worth",
          "I've seen a lot of ruins in Turkey over the years -- some of them quite spectacular -- but Termessos really is something special. The city's tucked up into the Taurus Mountains north of Antalya, and in many places (particularly the theatre), the combination of the ancient",
          "Termessos is probably the most interesting ancient city around Antalya. \u0130t was about 40 min drive from antalya to there and then we walked around 25 min to see the ruins of the Termessos. The city built top of the mountain and because of that ruins are very well protected. I and",
          "It's an excursion but well worth the hike to see the Roman and pre-Roman ruins at Termessos. Some even require a rock scramble off the track. The views are incredible, too.",
          "It's an excursion, but well worth the hike to see the Roman and pre-Roman ruins of Termessos. Some require even a scramble off the beaten path. The views are incredible as well.",
          "This is a good ruin site. You will need good walking shoes and good knees. The trail is narrow, ascending, moderately hard for a 60 year old who is not physically fit. Going up challenges your breathing, going down challenges your balance. When you get there, the views are",
          "Went here in October 2013 and it was still really warm! The path up to the theatre is well laid out but wear some sensible walking shoes though. How long it will take you to get up will depend on how fit you are! Can be anywhere from 30 mins to 1 hour- it's not very steep but it",
          "Visited Termessos on a cold and clear December morning and had the whole place to myself, except for one other couple. Part of the reason is the site's isolation: Once inside the gates of the park, you have to drive a steep 9 km road, and then walk another 1 km up a rocky path.",
          "As other reviews and guide books say, getting here is tricky and hiring a car is a very good option. We did this and it was an easy drive. It is excellent value at 5TL each. From the car park there is a temple and some tombs, but the main attractions are a twenty minute hike.",
          "It is a hike, going uphill, and should be steady walkers to take it on. Worth the trip to view the amphitheater. The day we arrived the skies became cloudy with a thick mist that added to the aura of these ruins. Amazing place high in the mountains that even the Romans couldn't",
          "We went there by ourselves (a couple) and we know it beforehand that there is no public transport at all. We took a minibus from Antalya Otogar to the entrance (ticket office) of Termessos, which is just next to a highway. This part is easy because the ride only takes around",
          "Loved Termessos. Well worth the drive from Antalya. It is a long long climb up to the very top but the views are absolutely jaw dropping. This is best suited to those who like hiking as the terrain is very rocky. Not at all suitable for small children or elderly people. Also",
          "I've seen a lo of archeological sites and this ranks with the most impressive, best part is there's no tour buses! We went in October and were nearly alone in this impressive place",
          "Of all the sites I visited in south-west Turkey (including Ephesus), this was my favourite. The reason is where it is set; high up among of the mountains towering over Antalya. The ruins are not extensively renovated and excavated as they are in the majority of other",
          "Great place with very little tourists (maybe a couple dozen over the gigantic site). Ruins are in rough shape but that only adds to the experience. Best thing we saw in Turkey besides our cab driver taking us back to his house to enjoy a feast of freshly slaughtered goat meat.",
          "This is a must see if you're in Antalya. You need a car to get there and you need sturdy footwear. You also need to be sure footed as there is a fair amount of walking and climbing over rocks involved. But it is definitely worth the visit. The place feels like it has just been",
          "after you arrive you need to walk 2 km to see the ancient theather. its a great place hiking so be ready for that. 3-4 hours is enough to see this place. have to be seen in Antalya.",
          "Do not miss Termessos. It's a spectacular sight. Unlike any other \"ruin\" you will ever see. It's a climb to the top but worth every step. And the sight is indescribable. Just go. And then you will understand why Alexander the Great didn't go.",
          "Don't go for an organised tour - they're all a rip off. 60 Euros (150 Turkish Lira) will get you a private taxi there from Antalya. The taxi will give you two hours to explore the ruins before taking you back to Antalya. It's 15TL each to get in (6 Euros). Major tip: wear",
          "Lovely Greek ruins in glorious surrounds. The theatre is a must see. The views are outstanding. I'd suggest getting a hire car and doing both Perge and Termessos in the same day. It'll be cheaper than a tour and you have the freedom to take it at your own pace. Adding a guide",
          "The pictures of the mountain overlooking the theatre cannot do justice to how amazing it is to be there yourself. If you can get there without a tour group then I recommend it so you can take your own time exploring the sprawling ruins. Certainly the best ancient site around",
          "Bus takes you to the bottom of the road,walk up a slight hill to the entrance of the park a taxi is available to take you further up the mountain.Then a step walk up on side to the city one of my favourite places",
          "It's a good 20 minutes walk from the entrance, and same again if you go on to the viewpoint at top of the hill. The views from the theatre and hill are amazing though. Recommend it. Also, there were only a handful of people there, so very peaceful compared to somewhere like",
          "The ruins are a challenge to walk up to - so not for people who have trouble climbing the pathway. But once you are there, the ruins are just amazing. You can walk all over them and see them in a much less renovated state than in Ephesus. The stadium is stunning, perched on a",
          "Definitely a must see for all who visit Antalya. My wife and I were looking for day trips to termessos and duden and after asking around, the average was 60 euros per pax with a guide. In the end, we opted not to go for a day trip and went by cab ourselves. The average quoted",
          "A trip to this place is a must for everybody able to do a small hike! You walk over ruins covered in moss with big mountains all around (including below you). After having visitied four amphitheater elsewhere it started getting boring but this is tremendous not so much by size",
          "I was kind of disappointed after having to spend a long time getting here. At the main gate entrance, there was this security post which looks like a security installation, and at first, I made a U-turn, thinking that i went to the wrong place. It was after enquiring from the",

          "Michelin gives Termessos 3 stars, their maximum,\"worth the trip\"! We were disappointed and would give it a maximum of 2 stars. The climb to the site is taxing, on a rough trail, not at all maintained. The ruins are exactly that: ruins. Very few stones remained on top of each",
          "This is a great site about 40 minutes by car from Antalya. You then hike uphill for about an hour, it's not a strenuous climb, the track is rough in places so wear shoes. The views are magical especially the theatre which is amazing.",
          "We took a taxi - 210TL from Kaleici including 2hr wait and Duden waterfall. Really needed another hour or two as we went round the various sites pretty quickly and did not get to all the tombs or Lion's Gate. Fantastic unspoilt site with no development or concrete bits spoiling",
          "Whilst the walk up the mountain is taxing its worth it just to see the amphitheatre built on the side of the mountain and great panoramic views",
          "If you are able to climb approx 1 km, you can reach the miracle city Termessos. There is a fabulous and huge cistern, which you can never find any photo of it. The antique Theatre is one of its kind, it is just above the clouds.",
          "Termesos is just nearby the Antalya. If you are planning to go and spend your holiday in Antalya, you should consider seing Termessos. Not: Ruins are in a bad condition. Turkey should consider revising their attitude to protect Their heritage.",
          "Be prepared for a steep and vigorous hike, especially when it's hot out, but it is absolutely worth the. 40 min drive from Antalya and hour hike up the hill. This is the unreconstructed city that Alexander the Great could not conquer. Amazing sights!",
          "Termessos is wonderful. A must for those who like history, geography and nature. A human tribute to the beauty of the Taurus Montains. The scenery is fantastic. Even Alexander the Great, whose army surrounded it (but did not conquer), recognized its uniqueness.",
          "I went to Termessos by car from Antalya (~40 minutes) and drove uphill 9 km, after paying the entrance fee. This place is high up and require some walking up and up from the parking area. It is a nice place for bringing lunch, since the ruins are spread out between lots of",
          "This place is brilliant, completely off the beaten path. You will need a driver or go with a tour company to access this place. But this city high in the mountains is the closest thing to Machu Picchu that I have seen. The views at the top are amazing and the history of this",
          "Termessos is not a well-known archeological site, even though it is only about 30 km from Antalya. It is located at the top of a mountain in a Turkish National Park, but to get to the most interesting ruins you need to hike about 2 km up a rocky path. But, this is not",
          "It was an excellent hike up to see the site which was spectacular. Bring good hiking shoes. We ran into only one other group of tourists so it was very enjoyable climbing over the ruins and imagining what life must have been like for its inhabitants thousands of years ago.",
          "On a roasting day with 40c heat we decided that we couldn't face the beach, so a late afternoon trip was the best option. The organised tour to the site was too pricey so we hired a taxi from the Old Town for 150TL. This was for 2 people so not too bad. On the way to Termessos",
          "not too much people visit this place, that leave it still wild and intriguing. We walk is not easy as it goes up and down but when you see the stones, you are really enjoying it. It is very peacefull",
          "The climb up the hill is not for the faint hearted but well worth it especially to see the amphitheatre. The views are amazing & the thought that a small town was built in this location is incredible. My 18 year old daughter did not want to go & then raved about it afterwards",
          "After having been to Perge and Aspendos, these ruins were in the state they had been found in and therefore were not as well-preserved as other ruins I'd seen. There was also an inclined climb for 20 mins which was quite tough in the heat",
          "Incredible place to visit if you like old ruins and Greek/Roman history but be warned it is quite a trek to the top after you leave the car park so a hat and plenty of water are essentialt",
          "This is a government run park, only one restaurant with place to buy water and incidentals. Hike up an see Roman ruins on the way. The views are stunning and the Roman Amphitheater at the very top is breathtaking.",
          "This was very hard work. The paths were almost non-existant and quite dangerous in places. The theatre was inspiring once you had managed to get there.",
          "This site is well worth a day out. It is par of a national park and a 9 km drive on a winding access road before you arrive at the main car parking area. This is definitely a day for decent walking shoes and water and picnic lunch. You should allow a least 3 hours. The park",
          "To visit this hidden treasure of Psidian culture, hidden off the beaten track, was the highlight of our Turkey visit. The trek from the car park is along a rugged but safe scramble. Good support from shoes is important: avoid it in loose sandals or flip-flops. No refreshments",
          "Nice ancient city, located in the southeast of the historic area of Pisidia on the territory of modern Turkey.",
          "It has the most amazing amphitheater with incredible vistas. Worth a trip! The ruins cover large area, so be prepared to walk and climb lots of steps. Difficulty level is moderate.",
          "We rented a car and drove to this site. We did not expect to first enter a national park. It was beautiful. We started our hike and started to see the ruins. It only got better and better. By the end, we were blown away by the beauty and the history. The surroundings are",
          "This necropolis gives you a completely differen perspective than the one you get visiting theaters etc. One of the best necropoli I have ever visited",
          "Great location and not too busy as it's a 20min, at least, walk up to the ruins from the car park. Take a packed lunch and plenty of water. Get off the beaten track to have a good look around (wear decent footwear) and you'll find lots of masonry/tombs that are not overly",
          "The ruins are set in a wonderful location in the mountains, approx. an hours drive from central Antalya. Fantastic views from the theatre and not a strenuous walk at all",

          "History lovers will love this place, I know my partner thought it was sensational, that\u2019s why I\u2019m giving it five stars. For me, a girl, it was an absolute nightmare. I hate heights. HATE THEM. I thought the climb up would be on a nice path, not a bit of it. It was so steep \u2013",
          "Great combination between a hike and the visit of a historical interesting site. Altogether it took us about 3 hours to visit the site. Keep the theater for the end as this is such a rewarding site (view & theater). Bring plenty of water. We rent a car from Antalya (28 euros",
          "We stayed in Antalya for a week and although we wanted to relax, we also wanted to see some of the amazing sights on offer. We had already done an organised tour of Side, Perge and Aspendos. Although these ancient cities were incredible to see, as we expected, going with a coach",
          "This place is magical, and as it has not been uncovered by archeologists you see it the way it was discovered (with no restoration as in Aspendos). The climb up is a bit challenging but if you take your time, you will be rewarded by perhaps the most beautiful sight you have ever",
          "This is an amazing sight. We hired a taxi in Antalya to take us there and to Karain Cave. The ruins are very interesting and the signs, in Turkish and English, are very helpful. Note that it is a good hike up the hill on a rocky trail. But it is worth the effort.",
          "Enjoyed several hours here. Lovely to walk around finding more and more ruined buildings as you go. With the spectacular mountain views it wasvone of the most enjoyable ruins to visit along the coast. Wear sensible shoes and realize that it will take you at least 20 to 30",
          "Even though i dont like historical place because i think they are just a bunch of old rocks, Termessos is a totally different experience. It is like hiking and learn some history at the same time.",
          "Since it was \"slow season\" we had a very peaceful morning at Termessos. After walking uphill for over 1/2 mile, you come to the upper wall and the real ruins. The theater is amazing, not huge but what a beautiful location with views over the valley in all directions. We tried",
          "Termessos, even though is a 30 minute drive from Antalya, is under-touristed. If you can arrange a taxi or rent a car to get you there, definitely do it. The city is ruins is a work of marvel. The scenery if the clouds allow it is breath-taking. Its a pity little is known of its",
          "The views of Teremessos theatre are fantastic. Reading the guide books and Tripadvisor, we were a bit concerned about the walk up but it was nowhere near as bad as we were made to think. It is around 2km walk up from the Carpark, along a well defined track. It is a little steep",
          "I first visited this site in 1996 and it really stood out in my mind at the time. Back then I saw it on a warm, clear sunny day and the views were absolutely breathtaking. There are no other ruins in Turkey I can think of that are in such a natural and rugged surrounding. It",
          "The most dramatic setting for an ancient city in Turkey. While the theater is the main attraction, I recommend also hiking through the necropolis and take the trail all the way to the top where the weather station is located. From there you will get a 360 panorama of the Taurus",
          "Termessos is the best and remarkable attraction in Turky speciallu the Theater in top of montain and rock tomp realy it is ,there is same city it is very amaizing ,same city with this Magnitude in 2300 ago Did not miss visitIing Termessos specially Rock Tomb and",
          "This is perhaps one of the remarkable sites in Turkey - it has it all. A sense of a lost city, Indiana Jones moments and touches of Ozymandis and that's just the walk up the hill. Termessos isn't like Efes or Pergamon where the site is laid out and you don't have to",
          "Ruins and mountains create special atmosphere, the amphetheater is well preserved, interesting necropolis and caved tombs. There were no crowds (end of March) so we could enjoy this solitary place. Recommened to spend about 3 hourse there, take your own water and snacks.",
          "Amazing 2200 year old ruins. You will need a guide to nake the best of this visit. I went with Nirvana Travel, whose office is in the old town near Hadrians Gate. Their guide Ferit is a mine of information. Highly recommended. Best not to go on a cloudy day as I did. Take",
          "Termessos is the best attraction we saw while in Turkey. The first impression I had while we were getting closer to the roman ancient city of Termessos, was the fact that the city was built at an altitude of one thousand meters up in the side of the mountain (Solymos). Once you",
          "this was my first excurtion with my freind and i will not forget at all coz it very nice place and really i wold like to come back",

          "Thanks to yantai and CountryHopper09 for their insights and comments. Hopefully this won't be redundant to theirs. We chose Termessos at the G\u00fcll\u00fck Da\u011f\u0131 National Park because of the its reputation as one of the things to do around Antalya and recommendations in Lonely Planet",
          "This is an incredibly unique site and unlike any ruins I've seen before. Try to learn as much as possible before you leave and just relax when you're up there - it's such a special place, I regret not taking more time to just sit and think. The theatre is the most amazing part",
          "We rented a car and drove to Termessos from Antalya (about 1 hour drive). Since we drove, we were able to park pretty close to the top and hike the rest of the way. It was a short but somewhat strenuous hike to the ruins from the parking lot (about 20 minutes). The hike was",
          "This was well worth the effort to visit. Most of the site is interesting enough, but the large theatre is what really makes this. The views from it are quite good and scrambling around freely up, down and around the theatre was a real blast.",
          "Outstanding site at the top of the mountain. 9k drive up a winding mountain road and then 3k walk up to and through the ruins. The site is extensive and stands as one of the places that Alexander refused to conquor. However, visiting Antalya and not taking the time out to",
          "It's probably the best ancient site in Antalya. However, the climb is not for the elderly, weak or disabled, which is a shame. I think everyone who comes to Antalya should see this site.",
          "This is a spectacular Roman ruin site. It's more distant/remote location likely is the reason that is not developed and over run with tourists. The bus ride (from the port area) takes 3/4 hours and there is a ride from the park entrance up to the parking lot that provides",
          "The ruins of Termessos are in Termessos National Park. It's a pretty windy drive up to where you can go see the ruins. Visit the bathrooms before you start your hike up. It is about a 2300 foot hike up the mountain, not even terrain, part of the hike is climbing over rocks and",
          "Up in the mountains, peaceful and beautiful surrounds, this ruined city is impeccable in it's decay and beauty",
          "Thanks to geocaching.com we found our way to Termessos, a lost civilization in the clouds. This trip is not for everyone, the steep trail up from the parking area can be a challenge. But well worth the struggle! The open-air theater with the mountain backdrop was",

          "This site is some way out - about 25 km from Antalya and at 1000 meters up in the moutains - but it is really worth a visit. Foresee a three hour walk if you want to see all of it.",
          "Termessos is a unique historical site. And a unique sight of the beautiful mountains and sea! Lots of walking and climbing, but very well worth it. The site is not very developed, and this makes it even more magnificent. You can really feel the history, and exploring the",
          "We loved hiking for over three hours around this fabulous ruined city. Wear good shoes, take water and snacks and enjoy the history, the views and the ruins. Hike all the way up to the fire tower for complete 360 views.",
          "What a great view from the theatre. It is a long climb up a rocky path that is not suited to the many older cruise goers we saw, but on a beatiful day it is a site to behold.",
          "It is a must see. Theatre location is breathtaking. I wish I was prepared for it with having a picnic there. Wear good shoes.",
          "Termessos is beautiful - the ruins untouched and natural beauty all around. Views all around are fantastic, especially from the theatre. Very few people (unlike Ephesus) as it's not as accessible as many of the other ruins. We had a good map and some tips from our hosts in",

          "Termessos is located up in the hill above Antalya. Following a 9km drive up a winding mountain path you reach the car park. From here it is all rambling paths and climbing over fallen rocks but the result is well worth the climb.The ruins and monuments are all accessible and you",
          "You definitely need a guide because there are a lot of paths and monuments that the map (given to you at the entrance) doesn't show you. The view from the theater is breathtaking! It's a must-go adventure! Don't forget to wear comfortable sports shoes because there is a lot of",

          "Been there and will go again. termessos feels far off from the baking beaches of Antalya. High up, removed, wild and well kept, Termessos is a lot of walking, a lot of looking, and a lot of really nice time. Drive takes a while and the walk too, but it is worth it to clamber",
          "The ruins are on top of the hill and you need to walk for 2 1/2 hours. not recommended if you have young children",
          "Take one full day to see it - if you are into archaeology and ancient history. You can see it in shorter time yes, but you will not be able to enjoy all of the site. Make sure to study map before you go, as the site is really large and maybe you will not get to see it all if",

          "This ancient city is a real gem hidden up in the mountains. My mother (mid-60s and fit) and I drove up to Termessos. It's not hard to find and it's beautiful once you get there. We were there on a very, very hot July day. We took a lot of water, all of which we drank. We",
          "After a hike up the mountain, the whole sight had amazing views! Incredible to even think about how a thriving people could have even built this so long ago. The view from the theatre was breathtaking. It also helped that a group of French tourists there with us that",
          "Breathtaking views and amazing ruins. Definately worth a visit. We shared a taxi with another couple or it would have been expensive to get there.",
          "Termessos is quite a sight, but not for those unfit or who have difficulty with rough terrain. It's quite a drive off the Antalya-Fethiye road, and a stiff climb from the car park to the city proper. As others have said, ensure that you have plenty of water, and food if",

          "After a long day of walking the lift is really helpful to get you back up on the main part of Kaleici. It really is great if you have a pram or wheelchair or generally are tired of walking. Some great views from it too!",

          "We visited this place in the evening before dark. It wasn't busy at all so we got the sand sculptures all to ourselves. They were truly amazing and the level of detail in some of them was awe inspiring. Admission is cheap (20tl) and I would say this is definitely worth a visit",
          "We visited the sand sculptures as part of an all day tour around Antalya. We thought the sculptures were fantastic, absolutely stunning to look at, hard to believe they were made of sand at all and the time and effort that have gone into each piece is staggering when you stop",

          "It's a bit hard to get to for me (coming from the city on the other side) but for those that stay on Lara beach area it's easy enough to spot.Nice sculptures, won't take up too much of your time. Go when the sun is not very hot or nearly sundown.",
          "My wife said that I don't take enough photos of her, even though 90% of our photos are of her. I swear she wants more of her than of our kid. The first part of Sandland is great to argue about this topic. I showed her all the photos on my phone to prove I have taken hundreds",

          "It is very nice for no more than one hour just to enjoy the art of sand and take pictures, noooo more than one hour . No other activities found there.",
          "we was told it was at the end of the tram line so we started walking to look for it we walked and walked must have been 10 kilometres to find it, no sign posts at all, late afternoon when we finally reached it, a bit disappointed with it after walking all that way",
          "Sandland is nice. I thought it would be bigger, there were about 12 sculptures, all nicely and detailed made. It's nice to see when nearby, but i wouldn't extra travel from far to see it.",

          "The sculptures are well made, and look amazing, the ticket was about 15 Turkish lira. I suppose i had an expectation that it was bigger or something to that effect, considering we took a cab from old town and to Sandland and back again. If you are in the area, one should",

          "Very well maintained museum in a quiet area of the city. Every room has lots of information about Ataturk\u2019s life. The garden area is attractive too. Lots of security, as you would expect, but all unobtrusive.",
          "This modest museum is located in a typical Macedonian or Turkish house from the nineteenth century. (I didn\u2019t see many preserved). The life and times of Mustafa Kemal later Pasha later Gazi later Ataturk the founder of modern Turkey in English as well as Greek and Turkish.",
          "Having read \u2018Thread\u2019 by Victoria Hislop, I was keen to visit this museum and wasn\u2019t disappointed. Extremely well displayed and very interesting.",
          "Birth place of founder of modern Turkey. Visit is free of charge. Typical Turkish architecture of 18. Century. Well preserved. Unfortunately no furniture of that time. Friendly staff.",
          "It is free entrance. By the way, to open the door you have to push it really well because the door is heavy. There is the house (three floors) and the Turkish embassy just beside the house of the founder of modern Turkey. Worth a visit.",
          "This is the only museum I have ever visited in an embassy/consulate. It is a small museum contained in the house where he was born. I learned a bit about his life. It's very glowing for Atat\u00fcrk so I imagine it's not exactly objective but still feel it is worth visiting.",
          "Comparing with the past, it doesn't have really satisfying objects and furniture any more but still it is a place to visit in Thessaloniki especially for people from Turkiye.",
          "It is located behind the Turkish Consulate.It has three floors and a courtyard.The most impressive room on the 2nd floor is the one in which Kemal was born",
          "This museum is housed in a nice late 19th C traditional Turkish-architecture house in the lower part of Thessaloniki's atmospheric Upper Town. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's birthplace only contains a few personal belongings of his, but has many interesting pictures from his life and",
          "Definitely nothing special, but full of tourist. Visit if you have a time (minimum one hour) but not part of ,,must see'' place in Solun. Entry is free, but you must use a bell on door to embassy.",
          "A beautifully put together exhibition about the life of an amazing man and the life he dedicated to the foundation of a modern, egalitarian secular state. I had never seen some of the photographs or the film clips before.",
          "The Ataturk Museum is located inside the perimeter of the Turkish Consulate, therefore razor-wire fences, iron gates and police checks can deter you from visiting. It would be a pity to give up, though, because this is by far one of the most interesting places to visit in",
          "Attended Thessalonika with my family from Australia specifically for this. As a Australian born Turk, my fathers family was part of the 500,000 Turks who participated in the compulsory exchange from Selanik (Thessalonika) to Turkey. At the same token 1.5 million Greeks left",
          "Ataturk must mean something to you if this place is to be meaningful. It is quite sentimental. The documents give a nice overview of Ataturk\u2019s life.",
          "Ataturk was the founder of modern Turkey and a revered leader to all Turks. His birthplace, together with the consulate next door, was fortified like Fort Knox (Greece and Turkey do have a bit of history between them) and getting in was tricky - around the back down a lane and",
          "This is a little bit hard to find - it looks like it is closed but you have to go around the back and ring the buzzer for security to let you in. Well worth it to find out about the history of this very important figure.",
          "The guide informed that is not really the house of Attatourk and is outside of the city this is the oldTurkish consensus.",
          "Nothing really nice. It is nice to go if you have nothing else to do. There are hundred museum like this around the world, so there is nothing really to loose.",
          "Small Museum and in fact it shows a tiny small portion of this Extraordinary Leader's whole life ( who saved a huge Country after world war 1, ) and his achivements. But, visiting the Museum can lead you to deeply research this one of a kind Turkish Leader",
          "As the title says, this place and what I learned from my visit made this the highlight for me. I had no idea Ataturk was born here and the premises also house the Turkish consulate. The displays were well put together and informative. Highly recommended.",
          "I've been there many times, I fully respect the Ataturk and do my best to follow his advises to Turkish people. I was 14, when I visited first time, and it was much nicer than now. His bed, clothes and more personal belongings wree there before renovation. After that visited",
          "This house is completely refurbished, with painted walls and new wooden floor. Nothing about the decor encourages you to envision the history of the house. The exhibition is solely about Ataturk (which can be understood) and the Turkish contribution to the Greek culture and",
          "This museum should be of utmost importance to all Turkish and Greek people and also to all stfurniudents of modern History. The museum is the old house that Ataturk lived in a as a child and it's staggering to think that you are walking under a pomegranate tree that Ataturk",
          "This museum is at a central place of thessaloniki center but it certainly is part of history but not something special its more about praising Ataturk and what he did.",
          "The museum is really part of the Turkish embassy (for those like us who have difficulty finding it!) and is all about Kemel Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey but there is little that actually brings the man to life.",
          "If you are a Turk, you have visit that house. If you are a human who believe in freedom and democracy, you have to visit that house. A place full of history and memory of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk who is founder of Turkish Republic.",
          "The founder of Turkish Republic Atat\u00fcrk lived here when he was a child.Is was very well decorated with old furnitures untill five years ago but nowadays reorganized and unfortunately very empty.",
          "He was a half jew- half greek muslim otoman. He originated the modern turkish form of state. He was born in Thessaloniky. His born place is now the turkish consulate at Thessaloniky - Greece. You can judge history as it is written...",
          "Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was the first president of modern Turkey. He was born in this house when Thessaloniki was still under Ottoman rule in 1881. Thessaloniki wasn't liberated until 1912, much later than Athens. The house became the property of the Greek state, was sold off",
          "It was an amazing experience to see the place where the greatest leader of whole world was born. You should absolutely visit and see that beautiful place. The memories, stuffs which belongs directly to Atat\u00fcrk.. It touched all of us.",
          "Recently renovated Ataturk's birthplace is now a free museum explaining his life in Thessaloniki and forming of Turkish State. It is part of Turkish embassy -but you enter round the back through a garden.",
          "Easy to locate the museum and people are friendly when asked for directions. While we were there some school trip was also in the building. It's great to see that both nations value this place and keep it on stage.",
          "This place is like a pilgrimage place for Turkish citizens, of course not for religious thoughts but patriotic feelings. So there is no doubt that you will visit Ataturk's house if you are a Turkish and you come to Thessaloniki. Unfortunately, you may get a little bit",
          "The house where Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was born in 1881 is now a museum. Its open everyday except Mondays.Free entrance. One must see.",
          "Of course it is very important museum for Turkish people. Ataturk was born that house and it is in Turkish Embassy border. Ataturk is a best lider of the century. You can read his life and his actions at the museum.",
          "Goosebumps! Good information in English as well as Turkish. Both our children loved it as well. After visiting you can walk in the close area where shops sell Ataturk souvenirs.",
          "As Turks, we always heard, our founder was born in Thessaloniki. Hence, for us, it is like a pilgrimage to visit Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's house. Inside the house, every room depicts Ataturk's life, starting from his childhood to adolescent. Lots of pictures and personal",
          "Ironically, the founder of the Turkish Republic is probably rolling in his grave based off what is happening there now. But that shouldn't deter you from visiting his birthplace in what was then Ottoman Greece. It's in the courtyard of the Turkish Embassy, so go around to the",
          "With no exception, a visit to the birthplace of Ataturk is organized by every tour which comes from Turkey. Although very few - and some just copies, many items that the founder and first president of Turkey used in his young ages before going to Turkey are exhibited in this",
          "Which is the birthplace of Ataturk isn't an easy question to answer until you bump into his house in Thessaloniki. This house is the favorite touristic place for all Turkish people which are coming straight from Turkey to see it.",
          "As a Turkish person who grew up listening to the stories of this house, it was a dream come true. Seeing details about the life of our leader Atat\u00fcrk, was definitely the highlight of our trip.",
          "Ataturk was a visionary Turkish leader. For those unfamiliar with his role in European history I recommend visiting the Museum as it details his life. \" My people are going to learn the principles of democracy, the dictates of truth and the teachings of science\". He was born",
          "My review for this place is very emotional. There are not enough stars for me to rate this place. As a Turkish citizen this place is sanctuary for me. This is where our founder Ataturk is born. I strongly suggest to everyone who would like to learn about a great leader who took",
          "Interesting enough for a quick visit, not very big. Entrance is free, but do take your passport in case it's required, I didn't need to show mine, but some did.",
          "Since 2013, second time visite of museum. We didnot visited inside of hause museum at 2013. For o long time it is restorated. We saw restorated of museum and enjoyed so much. Rooms are dedicated to time periods from birth to high school as \"Selanik \"period. Military collage",
          "The man who salvaged the nation of Turkey from the French, English, Russians and the death of the Ottoman Empire was born in Greece. Not everything he did was heroic.",
          "This caught us totally by surprise, since we did not expect to find the birth place of the founder of modern Turkey to be located in Thessaloniki. The military presence in front of it peaked our curiosity. Everything was preserved and it seemed frozen in time. Interesting.",
          "This museum is the house where Ataturk was born in 1881. Today it is adjacent to the Turkish consulate, and secured by Thessaloniki police to prevent hostile movements.",
          "I think because it is a part of our history (Thessaloniki/ Greece) it worth a visit also from locals. The only think that i would prefer to see is the real furniture and how it was before the renovation. It is interesting.",
          "The house is attached to the Turkish embassy. It was a bit unsettling to see a police coach and riot police outside. The house is a museum to the Turkish leader and houses rooms to resemble how he lived. Only downside for me, was that the video's and any commentary was in",
          "I realize the birthplace of Ataturk is massively important to Turkish people. But compared to so many other amazing things to see in this region, this house was a bit boring. Just a few artifacts from his life as a rich kid. Because many Greek people are hostile towards Turkey,",
          "The founder of secular Turkiye had been born in Thessaloniki... This museum provides you with a brief summary of a period and a perspective on this period.",
          "I learned that Turkish tourists treat this place as a mecca. don't forget to bring your passport since it is required for entry. If not on you, cross the street and you can get a look at the edifice from the outside",
          "I was staying literally 100 m from this place so decided to pop in. It's informative and the pictures gives you a better sense of Thessaloniki identity during that time, not to mention the rise of Ataturk. Take some of what's being fed to you with a large pinch of salt - it is",
          "Surely a place to be seen for exploring one of the worlds greatest leaders birthplace and life. Sadly, its original decoration couldnt maintained however it's atmosphere still preserved. The house located at the backyard of Turkish Embassy and its free of charge.",
          "This is located within the compounds of the Turkish consulate - so to find it, just look for Turkish consulate. Entrance is to the back of the main entrance. This is an interesting building and important building for the Turkish people. There are some good exhibitions of",

          "A very well kept \"museum\" of Ataturk. The officials were very helpful. The chronology of Ataturk's life in Thessaloniki and pictorial evidence was quite impressive.",
          "Housed behind the Turkish Consulate in Thessaloniki this is a must to see for anyone not just Turks. A very simple and practical house with all the basics but no luxuries unlike the Palace recently built in Ankara. Ataturk lived his life in the same basic way of this house and",
          "Every Turk should visit this house to understand the early life of founder of Modern Turkiye. It takes you to old times. Be aware, the parking is very problematic in this area, it is better to take taxi.",
          "This house was a very good place to go to and was worth time. Although the speciality of this place there was room for improvement. The house was very well done like a museum and was very informative and the reconstructions of some of the items or people were outstanding but it",
          "The museum itself is just a house at the back of the Turkish Embassy and the displays are fairly minimal - apart from a good collection of photos. The real reason you would go would be to read the printed information there. The highlight is the list of achievements of KMA - I",
          "It was a very big experience for me to see the Ataturk's birthplace. Even in the entrance you will feel the ambience and emotions are getting bigger. It was almost my only reason to come to Thessaloniki too see the place that where Ataturk has born.I loved the every second I",
          "Difficult to find , with security door at the entrance because you have to enter the \"embassy\" of Turkey first with security check .The house where Ataturk lived in has good documentation inside. Even the tree where he played in , is still there.The house is not big .",
          "I didn't know this when I went because it seemed that his house would be facing the main street. If you see a group of policemen, you're in the right place but you have to walk around the building and ring the doorbell to be let into the museum. It's worth a visit when you're in",
          "This is a very comprehensive view of Ataturk the man from his childhood to his accession to power. It has recreated rooms and many films. It is set up very well and is quite comfortable with benches for sitting while viewing the films in some rooms.",
          "You should definately pay a visit to the house where Ataturk,ancestor of Turkish Republic, was born and belongings are exhibited. The entrance is free and the place is close to the center. You will have the chance to observe his nature in firar hand.",

          "An eulogy to the founder of modern Turkey, his birth home is transferred into a museum. The wax statues of Ataturk and his mother are scary good! One can get a pretty good notion of the Turkish/Ottoman history in the late 19th and early 20th century.",
          "Very instructive museum, about the life of a great man. You can see some personal belongings of Atarturk, and also an impressive wax statue of him, which seems to be real. The rest of the house has been emptied. But the most important are the numerous texts, audio and video",
          "Mustapha K\u00e9mal Atat\u00fcrk / 1881-1938 is born in Thessaloniki. The house wich is belonging to the Turkish Consulate now is a museum. There is nice model of Ataturk exposed and of course you will find the history of his life and what he has done. I'm a great admirer of this man who",
          "Obviously interesting from a Turkish perspective, but our British guest was also suitably impressed by the quality and setting of the exhibits. I thought it was just going to be \"and here's his birthplace...\", but each room was stacked with exhibits from his life, and tells the",
          "Very well preserved and nicely presented. Birth place of Great leader, founder of modern Turkish state. A must see place while I Thessaloniki not only for Turkish people, but also for everybody who is interested to feel the environment where a great leader was born.",
          "It was a great honour and pleasure for us to visit Ataturk's birthplace. Recently renoviert building was looking very good. The posters, pictures were great and the garden was also very nice. However I felt that the rooms were still empty and there was a need for adding some",
          "Interesting seeing \"ordinary\" house where such a great leader came from. Rooms a bit stark, would have been good to see some sort of reproduction of the house, other than a pristine kitchen and a couch here and there. Otherwise very informative, and interesting.",
          "If you like to experience an authentic style home, visit the Ataturks house in Thessaloniki.It is kept exactly the way it was when Ataturk was alive. it is now both museum and embassy for Turkey.",
          "Birthplace of the founder of the modern Turkish Republic. Museum is well organized and it consists texts in Turkish, English and Greek. There are also examples of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk's personal belongings. Entrance is free. I suggest everyone to visit this beautiful museum",
          "This restored house is a museum to Ataturk's life and well worth a visit. It probably bears little resemblence to how it was whenhe lived there but there are objects which belonged to him. There is a very good audio guide and it is very educational.",
          "I spent the first part of my holiday in Istanbul, and I am now in Thessaloniki for the second part. I am Dutch. In my country we have not been taught much about the events that led up to the great wars in this part of Europe and Asia, that made so many people suffer and caused",
          "Although we could not get inside cause police forces were all around from some reason, I think this place is great history monument. Since Ataturk was the father of modern Turkey it is worth to vist this place.",
          "The house that Ataturk was born. It shares the garden with Turkey Consulate. The house so the museum is small but still worth to see.",
          "We unexpectedly came across the house while visiting friends and family in Thessaloniki. What a gem. Staff were extremely courteous and professional and the museum was extremely informative and well presented. Ataturk was an incredible statesman and it was interesting to learn",
          "In the past years, Atat\u00fcrk's birthplace has been made into a museum that attracks many Turkish visitors (though texts are in Greek and English too). An important place for foreigners as well, since Mustafa Kemal has provided a model for a modern secular state that can be applied",

          "The entrance to the house is a little obscure and is actually at the back of the building. The house itself has information in every room about the life of the father to the modern Turkey. It very informative and whether you are Turkish or not it is of interest. To know where",
          "We visited the house on our school field trip. It was great to see the birth place of Ataturk and where he grew up however the house felt barren. I wish they had added more pictures and original artifacts without completely rebuilding the house.",
          "I can't give less, just i can't. Because, this place is so important for us. But, i should be honest. The restoration took the house's spirit and i don't think that, it's done with good thoughts. They took the spirit, they wanted to do it. Now, you will see nothing in the home,",
          "I owed a visit not only to Ataturk's house, but also to Thessaloniki (Selanik in Turkish, a nice, relaxing city), and the whole region, Western Thrace. It was great for me to be in the place where little Mustafa was born and grew up to be Mustafa Kemal. Ataturk's house takes",
          "If you are a Turk, it is very likely that you love & admire Ataturk, the founder of Republic of Turkey. All students learn about Ataturk's home in Thessaloniki. I was ashamed to see how this museum is organized. It's like a modern villa put on sale by a real estate company.",
          "Tucked away in a residential area in Thessaloniki, this house is the house our republic's founder was born and spent most of his childhood. Yes, it is true that the complex also houses the consulate and you need to ring a bell and ask for permission to visit, but the history",
          "It is just the fact that the building houses the Consulate of Turkey. Thus, the are police forces everywhere, high walls and it is prohibited to enter unless you are invited. It is a pity that such a beatuful building is not open to the public.",

        "wiki": "Antalya (Turkish pronunciation: [an\u02c8talja]) is the fifth-most populous city in Turkey and the capital of Antalya Province. Located on Anatolia's southwest coast bordered by the Taurus Mountains, Antalya is the largest Turkish city on the Mediterranean coast outside the Aegean region with over one million people in its metropolitan area.The city that is now Antalya was first settled around 200 BC by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon, which was soon subdued by the Romans. Roman rule saw Antalya thrive, including the construction of several new monuments, such as Hadrian's Gate, and the proliferation of neighboring cities. The city has changed hands several times, including to the Seljuk Sultanate in 1207 and an expanding Ottoman Empire in 1391. Ottoman rule brought relative peace and stability for the next five hundred years. The city was transferred to Italian suzerainty in the aftermath of World War I, but was recaptured by a newly independent Turkey in the War of Independence.\nAntalya is Turkey's biggest international sea resort, located on the Turkish Riviera. Large-scale development and governmental funding has promoted tourism. A record 12.5 million tourists passed through the city in 2014.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city was founded as \"Attaleia\" (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), named after its founder Attalos II, king of Pergamon. This name, still in use in Greek, was later evolved in Turkish as Adalia and then Antalya. Attaleia was also the name of a festival at Delphi and Attalis (Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c2) was the name of an old Greek tribe at Athens.  Despite the close similarity, there is no connection with the name Anatolia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKing Attalus II of Pergamon is looked on as founder of the city in about 150 BC, during the Hellenistic period. It was named Attaleia or Attalia (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) in his honour. The city served as a naval base for Attalus's powerful fleet. Excavations in 2008, in the Do\u011fu Garaj\u0131 plot, uncovered remains dating to the 3rd century BC, suggesting that Attalea was a rebuilding and expansion of an earlier town.\n\nAttalea became part of the Roman Republic in 133 BC when Attalus III, a nephew of Attalus II bequeathed his kingdom to Rome at his death in 133 BC. The city grew and prospered during the Ancient Roman period and was part of the Roman province of Pamphylia Secunda, whose capital was Perga.\nChristianity started to spread to the region even in the 1st century: Antalya was visited by Paul of Tarsus and Barnabas, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: \"Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, and from there they sailed to Antioch\". Some of the bishops attributed to the episcopal see of Attalea in Pamphylia may instead have been bishops of Attalea in Lydia (Yanantepe), since Le Quien lists them under both sees. No longer a residential bishopric, Attalea in Pamphylia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.The 13th-century Seljuk mosque at Attalea, now in ruins, had been a Christian Byzantine basilica from the 7th century. The Great Mosque had also been a Christian basilica and the Kesik Minare Mosque had been the 5th-century Christian Church of the Panaghia or Virgin and was decorated with finely carved marble. The archaeological museum at Attalia houses some sarcophagi and mosaics from nearby Perga and a casket of bones reputed to be those of St. Nicholas, the bishop of Myra, further down the Turquoise coast.\nAntalya was a major city in the Byzantine Empire. It was the capital of the Byzantine Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots, which occupied the southern coasts of Anatolia. According to the research of Speros Vryonis, it was the major naval station on the southern Anatolian coast, a major commercial center, and the most convenient harbor between the Aegean Sea and Cyprus and points further east. Besides the local merchants, \"one could expect to see Armenians, Saracens, Jews, and Italians.\"At the time of the accession of John II Comnenus in 1118 Antalya was an isolated outpost surrounded by Turkish beyliks, accessible only by sea. Following the fall of Constantinople in 1204, Niketas Choniates records that one Aldebrandus, \"an Italian by birth who was strictly raised according to Roman tradition\" controlled Antalya as his own fief. When Kaykhusraw, sultan of the Seljuk Turks attempted to capture the city in 1206, Aldebrandus sent to Cyprus for help and received 200 Latin infantry who defeated the attackers after a siege of less than 16 days. Kaykhusraw would take Antalya the following year and build its first mosque.. People of Christian were rebelled and captured Antalya with aid of Walter of Montb\u00e9liard in 1212. Briefly restored Byzantine rule in Antalya was ended by Kaykaus I in 1216.\n\nThe city and the surrounding region were conquered by the Seljuk Turks in the early 13th century. Antalya was the capital of the Turkish beylik of Teke (1321\u20131423) until its conquest by the Ottomans, except for a period of Cypriot rule between 1361 and 1373. The Arabic traveler Ibn Battuta, who visited the city in 1335\u20131340, noted:\nFrom Alanya I went to Antaliya [Adalia], a most beautiful city. It covers an immense area, and though of vast bulk is one of the most attractive towns to be seen anywhere, besides being exceedingly populous and well laid out. Each section of the inhabitants lives in a separate quarter. The Christian merchants live in a quarter of the town known as the Mina [the Port], and are surrounded by a wall, the gates of which are shut upon them from without at night and during the Friday service. The Greeks, who were its former inhabitants, live by themselves in another quarter, the Jews in another, and the king and his court and Mamluks in another, each of these quarters being walled off likewise. The rest of the Muslims live in the main city. Round the whole town and all the quarters mentioned there is another great wall. The town contains orchards and produces fine fruits, including an admirable kind of apricot, called by them Qamar ad-Din, which has a sweet almond in its kernel. This fruit is dried and exported to Egypt, where it is regarded as a great luxury.\nIn the second half of the 17th century Evliya \u00c7elebi wrote of a city of narrow streets containing 3,000 houses in 20 Turkish and four Greek neighborhoods. The town had grown beyond the city walls and the port was reported to hold up to 200 boats.\nIn the 19th century, in common with most of Anatolia, its sovereign was a \"dere bey\" (landlord or landowner). The family of Tekke O\u011flu, domiciled near Perge had been reduced to submission in 1812 by Mahmud II, but continued to be a rival power to the Ottoman governor until the early 20th century, surviving by many years the fall of the other great beys of Anatolia. The records of the Levant (Turkey) Company, which maintained an agency in Antalya until 1825, documented the local dere beys.In the early 20th century, Antalya had two factories spinning and weaving cotton. As of 1920, the factories had 15,000 spindles and over 200 looms. A German-owned mill baled cotton. There were gin mills.In the 20th century the population of Antalya increased as Turks from the Caucasus and the Balkans moved into Anatolia. The economy was centered on its port that served the inland areas, particularly Konya. Antalya (then Adalia) was picturesque rather than modern. The chief attraction for visitors was the city wall, and outside a promenade, a portion of which survives. The government offices and the houses of the higher classes were outside the walls.\n\nAs of 1920, Antalya was reported as having a population of approximately 30,000. The harbor was described as small, and unsafe for vessels to visit in the winter. Antalya was exporting wheat, flour, sesame seeds, livestock, timber and charcoal. The latter two were often exported to Egypt and other goods to Italy or other Greek islands, who received mainly flour. In 1920, the city had seven flour mills. Wheat was imported, and then processed in town before exportation. Antalya imported manufactured items, mainly from the United Kingdom.The city had a Greek minority that made up 1/3 of the population until the population exchange.Antalya also had a tiny Armenian population which had a Church on the street of\"Hamam \u00e7ikmazi\"named Hovhannes Surp Garabed,which was later on demolished.Antalya also had a Jewish community which had a tiny Synagogue in the neighborhood of Balbey and a Talmud Tora ,The Synagogue was closed in 1948 and its exact location is not known and the Synagogue might not exist anymore.The Jewish community had 2 graveyards and one was located across \"Donerciler carsisi\"and was demolished when the area was opened to construction ,But one marble tombstone belonging to a Jewish person named Raphael Moshe was transferred to the Antalya Museum where you can see the tombstone in the museums garden.\nThe city was occupied by the Italians from 28 March 1919 to 5 July 1921 during Turkish War of Independence. Large-scale development beginning in the 1970s transformed Antalya from a pastoral town into one of Turkey's largest metropolitan areas. Much of this has been due to tourism, which expanded in the 21st century. In the 1985 singing diva Dalida held her last concert in Antalya.\nAntalya was the host city for the 2015 G-20 summit and the EXPO 2016. Five countries have their consular missions in Antalya including Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Belgium and Serbia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area is shielded from the northerly winds by the Taurus Mountains. Antalya has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with hot and dry summers and mild and rainy winters. Around 300 days of the year are sunny, with nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight per year. The mean sea temperature ranges between 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in winter and 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) in summer. The highest record air temperature reached 45.4 \u00b0C (113.7 \u00b0F) on 1 July 2017 which normally averages as high as 34.4 \u00b0C (93.9 \u00b0F) and the lowest record dropped to \u22124.6 \u00b0C (23.7 \u00b0F) in February, when the low average is as low as 6.1 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the Address-Based Birth Recording System showed a metropolitan population of 1,001,318 (502,491 male; 498,827 female).

Antalya Metropolitan Municipality's covered wholesale food market complex meets 65% of the fresh fruit and vegetable demand of the province.Since 2000, shipyards have been opened in Antalya Free Zone, specialized in building pleasure yachts. Some of these yards have advanced in composites boat building technology.\nCorendon Airlines and SunExpress are headquartered in Antalya.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDespite having architectural heritage dating back up to Hellenistic times, most historical architecture in Antalya date to the medieval Seljuk period, with a number of mosques, madrasahs, masjids, caravanserais, Turkish baths and tombs giving the city a Turkish-Islamic character. Historical architecture is concentrated in the walled city, Kalei\u00e7i; ancient structures are not well-preserved in the rest of the city of Antalya as the modern city was built on the ancient city. Kalei\u00e7i, with its narrow cobbled streets of historic Ottoman era houses, is the old center of Antalya. With its hotels, bars, clubs, restaurants, and shopping, it has been restored to retain much of its historical character. It is surrounded by two walls in the shape of a horsenail, one of which is along the seafront, built in a continuous process from Hellenistic to Ottoman times. The historical harbour is located in this part of the city; narrow streets extend from the harbour and branch off into the old city, surrounded by wooden historical houses. Cumhuriyet Square, the main square of the city and a spot very popular for tourists and locals, is surrounded by shopping and business centres and public buildings. There are sites with traces of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Seljuk architecture and cultures. There are also examples of the local Greek architecture in the city, with five Greek Orthodox churches in the old city.The walled city is surrounded by a large metropolitan area. With high rates of immigration since the 1970s, this area contains large gecekondu neighborhoods that are not well-integrated into the fabric of the city and suffer from poor economic conditions and insufficient education. Gecekondu areas are concentrated in the Kepez district, where an estimated 70% of the houses were gecekondus in 2008. In 2011, it was estimated that there were 50\u201360,000 gecekondus in Antalya, housing around 250,000 people.Antalya has beaches including Konyaalt\u0131, Lara and Karpuzkald\u0131ran.

For general elections, Antalya elects 18 Members of Parliament to the Turkish Grand National Assembly.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\nAntalya has traditionally been seen as a stronghold for the Kemalist centre-left party Republican People's Party (CHP). Being the capital of the fifth most populous province in Turkey, Antalya is politically strategic and has been a target for the governing center-right Justice and Development Party (AKP). The AKP unexpectedly won control of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality in the 2004 local election. The AKP won a plurality in Antalya in the 2007 general election, symbolising the city's political transformation from a CHP stronghold to a CHP-AKP marginal battleground in the 21st century. The loss of Antalya was a major political setback for the CHP not only because of its significance as a centre for tourism, but also because the CHP's former leader Deniz Baykal is a Member of Parliament for the province. The province is divided into 19 districts.\nThe CHP regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2009 local elections, though the AKP won a plurality in the 2011 general election. The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) also have a strong political base in Antalya, winning approximately between 15 and 25% of the vote in elections since 2007. The city voted in favour of the AKP government's proposed constitutional reforms in the 2007 referendum, but voted against the reforms proposed in 2010.\nIn the 2014 local elections, Antalya once again voted for the AKP, with the MHP taking support away from the CHP by winning a record 24.3% of the vote. The CHP subsequently accused the AKP of systematic electoral fraud, and the presence of government minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu at one of the vote counting centres drew strong condemnation. In the 2014 presidential election, the CHP and MHP's joint candidate Ekmeleddin \u0130hsano\u011flu won 53.08% of the vote. The AKP's candidate Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan won 41.63% of the vote, and the HDP democratic socialist candidate Selahattin Demirta\u015f won 5.30% of the vote. Antalya was a hotspot for the 2013\u201314 anti-government protests against the AKP.The secular main opposition, CHP, regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2019 local elections.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe football club of Antalya, Antalyaspor plays in the S\u00fcper Lig.

          "This aquarium was a real disappointment to me. I expected something out of this world...dolphins, tuna, more interaction, optional dive opportunities...especially for this expensive cost. Mostly dark interior and not a wide variety of fish. Dubai Mall, Chengdu aquarium,",
          "We were here with our friends and elderly children. 9 and 12 y.o. It s a good escape from the hotel routine in Antalya, not far from Kemer region about an hour of drive. Interesting species and design.",
          "Went on a 2 hour trip, was ok for an hour, good, clean and very well looked after. Enjoyed our time there.",
          "This was truly a wonderful experience. The tunnels are beautiful. Plenty different species of fish to be seen. Shark feeding took place at 12pm. Extremely clean and worth every cent.",
          "There were some works in the tunnel as well in the last room. They should do a discount for this and not charge the full price which is anyway too expensive for that what you get!",

          "Kids love it, probably our 5th visit, look online before to see if any offers and you can also get a combi ticket to visit the other attractions in the same building such as wild park or the snow world. Also if you check feeding times you may get to see them feeding the sharks.",
          "We paid 58 Euros via Tripadvisor for two tickets being there on our own. The aquarium is very small even though it's the \"biggest tunnel aquarium\" in the world doesn't mean it's big altogether. After maybe 30 minutes you've seen everything, we were surprised about how fast we",
          "We visited this attraction in July 2019 as part of our TUI Antalya/Aquarium Excursion (TUI Family Life Kaya Side.) This was an absolute highlight of our holiday. The Aquarium is extremely good and easily rivals many of the Aquariums found back in the United Kingdom. We then",

          "The aquarium was okay but grossly overpriced been in a lot more which are cheaper and far, far better, ie Dubai. It is very lacking, wouldn't recommend. Also went to 3D cinema which was a joke. Restaurant/cafe was good.",
          "The aquarium is nice if you've never visited one before. But go to your average zoo and you will find at least similar aquariums there. I doubt the claim \"world's lbiggest tunnel aquarium\" is right. It may be in meters length, but for sure the aquarium itself is not very large /",
          "Good but not great. If you have young kids they will enjoy the tunnel which is claimed to be the longest in the world. Entrance is 38 euro (2019).",

          "I was with my kids to the Antalya Aquarium during my summer holiday and I was nice surprised. It is a good option to spend half of the day especially for family with kids. I liked very much the moments with feeding fish, with the diver making show for kids etc.",

          "Not worth the money we paid \u00a362.10 for 2 tickets and that was just to see the aquarium and not the other events that were onsite. Children will enjoy it and it was a nice displace of marine life but not at that price.",

          "Verry poor exhibition and verry expensive for what you can see. We are disapointed. I do not recomand",
          "It was a good experince as a family visit. We visited on Tuesday, no long queue. A very expensive gift shop as usual. The enttance fee was expensive. 32 euros per peron, a bit cheper for children. It took about 2 hours to visit. The big tunnel was the most exciting part I guess.",
          "It you are a fan of sea world you will enjoy it. It is very peaceful inside. Don't forget to tlread the info about each one.",
          "The equivalent of being served fish fingers at a Michelin restaurant, good because it's got a good presentation, but crappy because it's the same fish just pooping in a longer pond... Like a bad tinder date, when he brags about how long it will take and lo and behold, it's over",
          "Very bizarre tourist attraction. Foreign tourists and Turkish citizens treated unequally. Tourists pay 7 times as much entrance fee - $ 35 versus $ 5 for Turkish citizens. Such discrimination would be illegal in EU or USA. Also, souvenir/gift shop is a TOTAL RIPOFF. No",
          "Good decoration in aquariums but the price of ticket is very much for it. I spent about 1,5h for all aquariums. Really nothing interesting for this money.",

          "The aquarium entrance and individual fish tanks are fantastic. The longest under water tunnel in the world...has something missing...the missing thing being fish! The poor thing about the place is the price of the gift shops. 35TL for a Starbucks cold coffee left me shocked",

          "It Is really a great experience , but you should do the following before you go: 1.Make sure that the wither is clear , because its its cloudy you will not be able to see the view all what you gonna see is the clouds . 2. Take a warm cloths to ware up there .",
          "The Antalya Aquarium was extremely overpriced for the amount of tanks and fish you get to see. The photos you see are all misleading and there\u2019s not a great variety of fish. The tunnel is not so big and is extremely shallow so the fish can\u2019t even swim over the tunnel. Would",

          "Quite a small aquarium, took less than 45 minutes to go theough the whole thing slowly with three young children. $35 an adult and only a tiny bit cheaper for children 2-12 years. Have visited much more interesting aquariums in other places that are significantly cheapers. Staff",
          "Fantastic aquarium with a large gift shop, in built Mac Donald\u2019s and Mado Ice Cream which were highlights for our three and four year olds! Keeps family busy for a few hours. There was also reptile house and snow land but we did not enter as our kids were tired.",

          "Booked through trip advisor told on information pack you get shuttle will be at your hotel about 9.30 - 10.00 am nothing turns up ring up the aquarium. To be told the shuttle only operates on Tuesday. This is wrong and they are selling the wrong information!!",
          "The aquarium has some great innovative displays with scenes set out where the fish swim about. Its lovely. So like an underwater old city or an underwater plane just to name a couple. It also has the worlds biggest tunnel. The lighting is fab too as used really well through",
          "Visited the aquarium with my wife and son while staying in Antalya. The online booking was easy and straightforward, tickets were valid for up to a week from the date of booking, and check-in was quite fast. The staff were representable and friendly, and all spoke good English.",
          "We paid \u20ac40 pp to enter the aquarium, whilst it boast the longest tunnel aquarium, the variety of fish to see was very limited. There were additional areas to visit that required extra fees to be paid. The whole aquarium could be seen within 20-30 minutes. Personally, we felt it",
          "We wanted to visit the aquarium with 5 persons. First they show us prices in dollar (40 dollar per adult). We insisted to have regular prices. They show us the price on a calculator and indicates 220 TL. They refused to show me official prices in TL. We found out that Turkish",
          "For an aquarium only ticket for our family this was a huge disappointment. Very expensive, not many fish, over in a flash and you are straight into the gift shop. Don\u2019t do it.",
          "Visited as part of my sisters hen holiday. Such a nice tranquil place, plenty of amazing fish and different species of sealife to see, we were lucky enough to be there for the shark feeding, great to see the divers feeding the sharks and stingrays and at times you can see them",
          "to see a full plane,mini car,submarine being used as artifacts for the marine aquarium was really clever great to know that they have the longest tunnel for the aquarium in the world as we were told but a really good couple of hours was spent here not only in the aquarium but",

          "The aquarium is a little bit out of town so by the time we got there, we were somewhat committed. The entry price was ridiculous, with extra to pay if you want to tickle lizards or do the 'submarine' cinema... Das Boot is on netflix. It's a lot cheaper to watch that. They",
          "Lovely aquarium but feel most of the tunnel tank that is in there lacks of sharks and fish. The other tank on the way round had plenty of fish but feel To improve they will have to fill tunnel tank a bit better.",
          "We came here today, paid \u00a3100 for 3 of us (700TRY). Thought it must be good with that price, what a total let down! Never been to a worse aquarium, even the blue reef in england is better and thats rubbish also. It took us no longer than half an hour, maybe 45 mins to get",
          "So as you can tell I think this place is amazing. Me, wife and daughter years old have been there in February. We loved the sharks and ray fish. Great place, claiming to have a biggest tunnel in the world. Tickets are expensive but well worth it",
          "Nice place for kids but a bit expensive. It would be better if both wildpark and aquarium could be visited with same ticket.",
          "Good for a visit with family. Central Location. Shark section is very fun. Facilities for eating are mediocre.",
          "Wandered along from Kaleici and spotted the Aquarium and thought might be about \u00a320. Group of 4 Turkish adults and kid ahead in the queue. Asked the price and surly guy pointed to Laminated price list in dollars: $35 for Aquarium/ asked how much in Turkish lira would have",
          "The weather in Antalya was rainy and we had one day left in Turkey. So we decided to visit the aquarium which looks quite impressive from the outside. We parked in a lot that was fairly empty. Approaching the building is a large sign saying \u201cinformation\u201d and in a little smaller",
          "great way to spend a day for both couples and families alike with something for everyone .Can be a bit pricey if a big party ,but it has lots of reptiles from all over the world with alot of info .It boasts a really good tunnel which i must say i was impressed with ,plenty of",
          "The place is big and nice decorated, has interesting ideas of different countries expositions but there are not many kinds of fishes to see, in the tunnel which is claimed to be biggest in Europe are not many inhabitants, you just walk into emptyness, so basically half hour",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the aquarium. Many many different species of aquatic animals. We went during the week and it was not busy at all. The price was good as well.",
          "Me and my son visited here as part of a Thomas Cook trip and trip included entry to Aquarium only, we were then charged \u00a310 each for Reptile house, again for snow room. This was also charged for the 4d video working out over \u00a350 each. You could do all of this in 2-3hrs it's not",
          "The place was overpriced. I think the price different between Turkish residents and tourists is crazy. It is over 4 times more expensive. If it was just me I would have turned away once I found out how expensive it is for tourists but I was with the wife. It is 33USD for",
          "According to the online review which I have seen from online about expensive entrance ticket makes me think twice before visiting this aquarium. However finally i decided to visit there. There is Mc. Donalds near by the aquarium, and also small but beautiful coffee shop. Once I",
          "It doesn't worth the money you give. Aquarium is very big, no problem with that but there aren't so impressive and big fishes. We have expected to see a big (or not small) shark or dolphin at least.",
          "fantasket time it has the longest glass tunnel in the world well warth a viset there two other attractions ice musuem and insects you will love them or hat them",
          "This was a nice trip, but incredibly overpriced for a small aquarium. We said if we ever visit Antalya again, we'd avoid it! It was very small and the kids liked it, but not really worth so much money.",
          "5th visit here, kids love it, best to get a multi pass to visit 1 of the other attractions such as wild or snow Place, great to go when feeding the sharks. Longest glass tunnel we've seen Large shop on exit! Burger King or Mcdonalds at the entrance along with a few other coffee",
          "The entry fee was little overpriced and in USD, which indicates that the area is built just for tourists. The variety inside is rewarding.",
          "It claims to be the largest Aquarium but our London ones are better and cheaper. It was \u20ac120 to enter 2 adults and 1 child and also the ticket is only valid for the Aquarium not for the other activities inside. Was dis appointed as not good value for money. Yes another fail.",
          "We were fortunate to have divers in the tank that day. Kids loved the divers waving at them. The tunnel is vast with a large choice of sharks and stingrays. Would recommend. If you go with a tour group be prepared for them dragging you to a jewellery manufacturers and the",
          "It was a great time there especially with small kids. We had a great time there but the down side was that we expected more. Going through all the aquarium does not take a lot of time.",
          "The aquarium and reprtile park are brilliant.! Lots of fish and reptiles to see. The longest tunnel is great and definitely the highlight of the aquarium. Only 3 stars due to the cost (\u00a3200) for a family of 4 is rediculous and the staff d9nt speak English and make no effort to",
          "Of cause this is not Barcelona Aquarium but it is also a nice place with a lot of fishes from all seas and oceans of the world. Sharks, piranhas, coral fishes and many others. Territory is small - max 1 hour visit in slow pace. Trip itself is much longer so either ask your guide",
          "The Anatalya Aquarium very highly publicised venue in Anatalya but there are NOT MUCH aquarium stuff to be there to be seen only few type species. NOT VALUE FOR MONEY. NOT WOTH VISITING.",
          "To the General Management: I was with my 74 y.o. mum at the end of the day when lady called Rosa Mamadova, a sales from souvenir shop was sent \u2018to let people know it\u2019s the end of the visit\u2019. Rosa Mamadova immediately, as she heard me speaking Russian with mum, started shouting",
          "Had a great time with my daughters. The aquarium has the largest water tunnel and is very well presented. Plenty of fish and information to keep you and family busy. Bonus is it also has a reptile park which is very good. There was also a couple of other attractions but we",
          "We book a trip to the aquarium through our hotel which was the cheapest way we could find to do it which include the transfer. It was a pleasant drive up to the aquarium, around one hour forty-five minutes. However we were the only English people on the bus and the tour guide",
          "Really a good place not to miss if you visit Antalya. Its worth to visit with longest tunnel compared to Dubai Acquarium. Its very clean and kids enjoyed a lot",
          "Hi i just done this tour and i want people read this. TOUR OPERATORS METIN TOUR. I did phone viator to make sure they can pick us from hotel while i was in uk. After 30 mins wating they said they fine. When i call to ask where the free boattrip they said dont it and said lucky",
          "Touted to be the longest tunnel aquarium in the world, this place lacks diversity in terms of aquatic life on display. Though they have an impressive collection of sharks, the lack of other non-piscean species, like Octopuses, turtles, sea-horse etc. is striking, in-spite of the",
          "aqua world is the worst attraction I have ever visited. place was filthy half the slides didn't work and staff are RUDE!!! avoid at all costs this place is not what is advertised. the way they look after the place is dreadful and going by that I cant imagine they look after the",
          "It was a nice visit and the tunnel is great. I've seen better though and the ticket price is really high. But as you don't have that many attractions in the area, the aquarium is a good option if you travel with kids",
          "Visited yesterday and found the experience very good. It took us around 2 hours to view the aquarium, including seeing the sharks being fed. The admission price is too expensive though. 2 prices, 1 for tourists and 1 for Turks. We were lucky, we produced our TRNC driving",
          "It,s good place to visit with family. Can make good pictures and spend pleasant time. In 12:00 they have \u201cShark feeding\u201d. The prices are different for local people and tourists.",
          "Not the biggest place ,but a lovely example of how these places should be done . Excellent tunnel ,great shop and reptile house,maybe could have been slightly bigger. But a decent day out .",
          "A place for Kids. Nothing special, not so cheap..... To short for a visit indeed... It was a trip with Guide.",
          "We had great time with kids at the aquarium. It also houses a 3D cinema and a snow room. However, it is a bit expensive for foeigners.",
          "Rather expensive, but had to kill time before catching a flight in the evening. Annoyed I had to so much, however, pleasantly surprised on what was on offer. You could do the all attractions within 30 minutes to an hour. However, we stayed longer and had drinks in the cafe. I",
          "The aquarium is really great prepared, the arrangements of the polls are stunning - sank cars, airplane, some ancient figures, with sharks swimming around, it's a great experience to see it. The pool with rays is a key-point for kids, they look out of the water, kids can stroke",
          "Our son (3 1/2 years old) liked the aquarium, it was a nice experience, something interesting to do outside the resort. Definitely recommend \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Me and my family went today and decided not to proceed with entry as we were quoted nearly a 1000 something lira for 4 people!!!!as we were not from turkey and was originally asked for dollars which we didn\u2019t have! We\u2019re from the UK and have never ever seen this happen this is",
          "It is quite good but the price led me to expect much more..espacially when it comes to snow world ig has nothing and very very small..only 2 slides and most of the wh\u00e8els we sit inside were damaged..it is better to keep naming it ice museum rather than a snow world",
          "Very clean aquarium, great for all ages. Plenty of space to walk and take stroller. Lots of different tunnels and passages. Very clean and well maintained. The fish here are very well looked after. Lovely experience. Gift shop tad bit expensive but always the case with these",
          "Expensive, about 60$ per adult , this is not economic choice for family, it is nice place but it doesn\u2019t worth to pay 60$, very close to MM MIGROS Mall .",
          "Highly recommended for children\u2019s. A wide selection of fish. Avoid buying tickets from travel agencies as it will cost you more",
          "Great terarium and aquarium to visit in Antalya-Turkey. Advice- buy full pack tiket To see part with ice sculptures and 3d cinema with great sea and fish effects\ud83d\ude06",
          "It was supposed to be an exceptional and \u201eone of the largest aquarium in the world\u201d. Indeed, it is just average and not so big. The aquariums are rather small, except the last one, the number of fishes is limited and with nothing exceptional. Not bad, but aquariums of Wroclaw in",
          "Highly recommend if you visit Antalya with your child\u2019s , they will enjoy it . Especially the long tunnel",
          "Very nice aquarium. Many fish and very well maintained aquarium. It has a very large tunnel to walk through. Lots to do and see. Expensive $50 per person. Children under 3 are free. Not worth the entry fee. There are other sections connected to the aquarium but these cost",
          "We had fun and it was interesting but very dark and not very big. The tunnel might be long but not with big fish like big sharks. All in all it was ok since our hotel was very close but wouldn't come from far. I love sealife so I have visited many aquariums, Vancouver,",
          "It is really amazing aquarium. I have been in Dubai and San Diego aquariums, but found Antalya Aquarium bigger and more attractive. We enjoyed the Aquarium and then the Snow White world. The tickets prices are bit overrated, and I think they have to make it more reasonable. For",
          "There are a lot of species, and a very nice set up.The tunnel is just amazing and so pleasant to visit with the little ones.",
          "very big and interesting attraction with huge quantity of aquariums. its presented like a parts from different sides of Earth",
          "We enjoyed our time here and seeing all the different and wonderful ocean little creatures, but it\u2019s actually really expensive. We paid almost 85 euro for aquarium visit and Cinema for two people. About cinema - we recommend it. It was beautiful and exiting.",
          "Worst double priced ever in my life! Turkey just doesn\u2019t belong to Europe where this is illegal! 45 USD for not Turkish and 20 USD for Turkish! Don\u2019t let be yourself to be fooled!",
          "Tour guides state an hour to 1 1/2 should be laid aside, I would suggest 3 to 4 especially if your youngster love reading about all the species etc. A well laid out attraction with something to keep everyone happy. There are additional charges for the snow and wilderness venues.",
          "Everything is new and pristine but nothing spectacular. There is a shark feeding attraction but we missed it due to language barrier and lack of information so be sure to check this before you go. Access for buggies is excellent and toilets are clean. The aquarium itself is",
          "We went there from Kalei\u00e7i by bike! We enjoyed all the different activities there although it was a bit expensive. The aquarium was amazing with lots of different species of sea creatures from different parts of the world. It was very informative. The tunnel is also very nice.",
          "Booked our visit though our tour agent after the day we arrived. Lots to see but was restricted through time we had for the visit as we only had 2 hrs to get round and then we had to get back on the tour bus",
          "One of the biggest aquariums we have ever been to. A lot of species inside and also a lot of coffees and restaurants",
          "trying to spend a great time in it but once we arrived there the two hostesses sitting at the desk were not at all into costumer service and talking to us while seated and no one cares . Now the problem is if you are turkish you pay a price but if you are a tourist Baaam you",
          "its ok for an afternoon out but not as good as some of the UK ones.....it does have a mcdonalds which is a change over the all inc ...(but not as good) i would not ever go back",
          "We did a bike trip from Kalei\u00e7i to the Antalya Aquarium (8km)! It was a nice challenge that we advice for those who love biking! Anyway, once we were there, we enjoyed all the different activities there although they were generally more expensive than other tourist attractions",
          "Good afternoon out for us as a family 16yr old and 7 yr old both enjoyed the same. Great viewing tunnels on the way out.",
          "The aquarium is decent and clean but not inspiring. Did this trip because the kids are into visiting zoos. As mentioned in other reviews, accessing all the features available on-site is tricky if you are not terribly mobile. A long helical ramp (at least three loops) makes it",
          "There are 5 different activities inside this facility. First aquarium, there are aquariums seperated by geographic order and designed as where it belongs. I like that much. But dont expect amazing things. Secondly, the xd cinema, it is as good as it could be. Third, wild park.",
          "Good Moments in Antalaya Aquarium specially for kids, The main disadvantage for me, the aquarium required new types of fishes specially the BIG ones like sharks which are missed in it.",
          "We visited as part of a day trip and first thing to mention is you need to be relatively mobile to visit as there is a long spiral slope which links all the levels and its a good climb in the heat. The Aquarium itself is ok but the main attraction is the tunnel section which",
          "Antalya aquarium is not only an aquarium, beside the huge aquarium and the variety of species this place has wildlife hall ( reptiles and such) has 5D cinema and snow park. The place is well organized with lot of coffee shops and amenities",
          "We paid 190$ for two adults and 1 kid. It was full packet for wild park+ snow world +cinema + Aquarium.",
          "Was nice to go there but instead of feeding the sharks where everyone could watch its done in front of a tiny window where only a few people can watch",
          "Aquarium is very boring and definitely not the longest one for kids its good but not for teens . There are only small fishes not big ones and very expensive",
          "Very interesting, nice with magnific fish, with o long tunel. Very nice design. Exotic fish \u00een a natural habitat.",
          "Nice tunnel. Otherwise very small. The shark feeding was very interesting. You get to see lots of small sharks.",
          "The Aquarium is good however for the money you pay I was not blown away. They have the biggest tunnel in the world and various species of Sharks. However the kids were only mildly entertained. They do have a McDonalds on site so they had a good lunch afterwards. If you have a",
          "If you are in Antalya with kids this place is a must go . One can easily pass 3-4 hours over here . They have a separate reptile park and a snow world . You can buy combine tickets for all three or you can opt only for one of them . It\u2019s 4-5 kms away from the town so better take",
          "The kids were board, not well organized. Very expensive. Not much to see. If you have another choice for the kids go for it.",
          "Antalya Aquarium is one of the best aquarium in the world and the biggest Tunnel also I like almost every thing and I should put 5 stars but the price of 40$ adult and 27$ child is really too expensive",
          "To be honest, I'm not really sure why this gets so many great reviews. The aquarium is good, but certainly nothing special. As others have noted, it does have a long tunnel to walk under, but it seemed like fish stocks were low when we visited. All that said, it is probably",
          "Went here a few year's ago and so happy to come back. The place is amazing and wish we had time to do the cinema. We did the aquarium and snow world and couldn't recommend more. I wish we had the same in England. The place is amazing!",
          "The place is clean and modern but the admission is very expensive Should check it out if you looking for something to do for a few hours",
          "We visited the aquarium in June 2018 and it was exciting. Little bit expensive but awesome place to be visited. You can spend hours walking in the aquarium and it will not be boring. The most fascinating view is the entire plane inside in the aquarium.",
          "A lovely place to watch the sea world and very nicely maintained.We liked the long glass tunnel and so many varieties of fish in sea world.We also visited the Raptile World beside it and it has also many amazing reptiles species inside it.One can buy tickets for both or",
          "As per the price of the aquarium and being apparently the worlds longest tunnel, at a slow pace with photos and stops it'll take Less than 10 minutes to complete. Too expensive for what it is. No large sharks, complete waste of time. Esp when they say shark feeding, which is",
          "Biggest aquarium I\u2019ve ever been to. Excellent variety of sea creatures to view and also gets you really up close to the fish. Tunnel part of the aquarium is also very impressive. A little on the pricey side but to be expected given its size.",
          "We visited aquarium before but this one top them all.Amazing fishes and underwater life.if we come again will revisit that's sure.",
          "If you have never been to Aquarium or if your kids are fond of fishes, then yes you can visit this place. Although I don't really get a feel of visiting the biggest tunnel aquarium in the world. It is just like any other aquarium. They promote a lot of Sharks but they were",
          "we went to aquarium on the jet 2 trip from hotel and I would go by service bus and taxi next time the aquarium is very good but the trip we went on from hotel left a lot to be desired 7 hour for 1.1/2 hour in aquarium due to what else they include a trip to a jewelry factory,",
          "The Aquarium is very big and clean, the fish tanks are well decorated and they have plenty of fishes in different sizes and shapes. I recommend to visit the Aquarium.",
          "Was a nice excursion to do whilst in Antalya as it wasnt too far from hotel. Wasnt too pleased with the price, $39 just to go into the aquarium and if you wanted the full package its $80 or so. Bit extreme for my liking. The aquarium itself was nice, the tunnel was huge and can",
          "It is $35USD which works out to be more expensive that the one in London! We wanted to visit but after checking this it was a complete turnoff",
          "Fun for the kids but nothing us adults have not seen before, beware of the music in the gift shop, appauling and id have strung them all up if they worked in my shop, really not the place for ganster rap talking about their b****s motherf*****s Sucking **** the list goes on",
          "Visited on a rainy day. It was so crowded, my kid just didn\u2019t want to leave the stroller to look at the fish. No air, lot\u2019s of different smells. Paid 85\u20ac for 2 adult and a 4 year old. To much for the experience.",
          "I\u00b4ts not worth it for 35$ for adults and 27$ for children. You can get around for 15 minutes and is a little to see.",
          "Small fish are beautiful and have a lot of variety. The area around the aquarium is also very beautiful. Aquarium Tunnel is Tabular . Big fish there is not much",
          "We visited the Aquarium as part of a Thomas Cook tour, the sea life is excellent. The place is very well kept, the tanks look clean and have lots of sunken features like a car, an aircraft etc. You really only need a couple of hours to visit but it\u2019s definitely worth it to see",
          "Very helpful and ontime and NEVER goes wrong very cheap tickets and hotels so I will recommend anyone with this company",
          "I enjoyed the rest of the aquarium more then the tunnel they brag about. The tunnel aquarium feels under populated, the water is shallow and you will not have that deep underwater experience. After leaving Antalya Aquarium I felt the bitter taste of overpaying that lasted for",
          "Overall the aquarium is cool and all. There is this tunnel that is smth special, you can also see other stuff, like snakes, bugs ect, but you nees extra ticket. What I do not like is that it feels like a tourist trap, it is expensive. Your choice if you go or not",
          "It ist NOT the biggestTunnel Aquarium in the world... at first very expensive for 20 minutes walk to see everything.. we are disapointed. Not much Fisch around. Ive seen a better one already.",
          "Beautiful aquarium and great day out. We traveled from side to the aquarium which was quite far. The tanks full of lovely unusual fish. Loved the tunnel walkway. Would be good if there where better deals for if you want to see the reptiles as well.",
          "These place was very beautiful and included many activity aquarium ice city ski and restaurants and cafe and the location was perfect",
          "I bought tickets for the aquarium + snow world, reptile house and XD cinema online and that was a mistake. As we showed our confirmation and yet they wanted more money. It was very expensive and though the place was very nice, the straff were just incompetent and hung up the",
          "It was possible to choose a 'package'. We took the aquarium & reptile part. It was nice to walk around and see, I don't regret it but I won't visit it for a second time",
          "Aquarium itself had so much potential as the lay out and variety of tanks were great however there just wasn\u2019t enough variety of exciting fish! Couple of sharks and few other average fish that was it, went round it in about 15 minutes. Shame really 3D cinema was terrible,",
          "Excellently maintained,a bit out of the way to reach if you are travelling via taxi or private transport.At ticket counter they quoted me price in US $.Whereas the price of the ticket was not displayed at anywhere.Also price of the ticket is not mentioned on the ticket.",
          "It's okay to walk around for an hour but you have to pay separately for reptiles cinema and snow world we did 3 of them and I wouldn't pay the prices they charge if it was alltogther then maybe I was quite disappointed for what it was",
          "Nice tunnel aquarium, but the totally crazy price tell me to say ...save the money and it's only fish. 135 TL...what a shame",
          "Great mix of small and big tanks in the aquarium. They have brilliant themes tanks and the tunnel one will give you an up close view that is amazing. We didn\u2019t pay for any of the extras so only went into the aquarium. It is easy to find and there is a McDonald\u2019s at the exit to",
          "Specially aquariums. As a diver... but this is probably the biggest aquarium i have ever seen in my life... its great for children ... and families",
          "Lovely place to visit, much larger than I expected and the aquarium's tunnels were amazing. There was also a reptile world and indoor snow place there that looked nice, especially for kids, but we didn't visit.",
          "Entrance to the aquarium was insanely expensive at 301.50 Turkish Lira (for two people) for the aquarium alone. There were various other packages available that included a snow pack, cinema etc.. but we just wanted to visit the aquarium. The price was not worth it in the",
          "This was a good place for the family to visit when the weather was dark and cloudy. There could be better interactions with the fish pool's with the kids but the aquarium had good species of exotic fishes. You can get good discounts on line or if you have a tourist voucher.",
          "Very nice place to visit and see natures beauty. Only a short drive from Lara Beach and you can take in other sites ie. The Old City and Caves aswell.",
          "The entrance fee is very expensive and there is nothing interesting to see if you have been to aquariums before you don\u2019t need to spend money on this one. Tunnel is big but the was no fish in it:(",
          "We had a lovely day out at the Aquarium well worth a visit a good selection of sea life to see the tunnels are fantastic you feel as though you can actually touch the fish we had a snack in the snack bar which was a reasonable price & enjoyable. It is well worth a visit & would",
          "It is like you are in the sea and you among the different fishes etc. Also a good activity for children",
          "The visit started disappointing because of the small tanks at the beginning but it soon changed when we got to the main attraction. We thoroughly enjoyed it. I have been to a couple of aquariums before and this so far is the best. Unless you are a massive fan of creepy crawlies,",
          "Because I visited off season on Saturday around 14:00 it was like I had the Antalya Aquarium practically to myself. No crowds and few kids. If you have kids though it is fantastic and there is shark feeding at 12:00 each day. The display tanks featured ancient themes mostly but",
          "It was a very beautiful tour today. It was a bit expensive, but we enjoyed the day very much. The under water tunnel was amazing. We saw also the Wild Park, which was very nice. I can only give my best thumps up for this experience.",
          "ticket was 35$ and was good.not very good.near aktur park.had bus station near.easy to find.there was some problem with near street.they were rebuilding the streets.",
          "This is no Georgia Aquarium or Monterrey Bay Aquarium, but it does a fair job and deserves some points for effort. Not sure how they verify their claim of being the world's largest tunnel aquarium, but I suppose that is a decent highlight. Price for a normal tourist seems quite",
          "Because the Antalya Aquarium was just across the street to our hotel, SU hotel, we decided to see it! If you are in your holiday with the kids, don't miss it, they will be charmed of the mistery of the magic underworld! So, go ahead!",
          "It was smaller than I expected. Otherwise it was a nice experience for the whole family. Fish feeding was perfect.",
          "We went to have a look as we were told it was really terrific, so curiosity got the better of us. However the prices seemed a bit too extravagant. We have been to other aquariums so we did no think we would be missing out on anything really. We did not go inside. Some of those",
          "There aren't serious of the sea creatures but the design was beautiful and the snow world was amazing and fun.",
          "I Have to say this was disappointing I\u2019ve been to better eating there is only Mac Donald\u2019s and for those whom can\u2019t eat that well you stuffed and the place it\u2019s self it was ment to be the biggest in Europe and was ment to have sharks we didn\u2019t see any so I wasn\u2019t impressed",
          "Very nice, modern and large aquarium. Many species of fish. Nice and imaginative expositions. Barrier-free access. watch out for sharks!! :).",
          "I think it is too expensive. We have been there with free coupons so it was a good experience. There are so little sharks, which are too far worth to see by this ticket pay.

          "It\u2019s clean, but very expensive for what it has to offer. The tour takes approximately about 1 hour. It didn\u2019t excite me as much.",

          "This place ia amazing the tunnels are endless with all variety of beautiful fishes and the wildlife section is out of the world must visit.",
          "We came here because it was raining and we wanted to do something indoors. We paid about \u00a330 per person for the aquarium and wildlife package. The whole experience was very standard - nothing ground-breaking. It wasnt worth what we paid. The animals weren't very interesting and",
          "Excellent place to go with all ages and lots to see. Excellent views to see. Good prices for eating too.",
          "i had paid 20 lira and when my friends had asked how much the price had gone up to 60 lira all of a sudden. i stepped forward and asked them in turkish why the price was higher and they said because they didnt have a turkish citizenship card and i made it clear to them that",
          "I loved this, and so did my very young child, who was enraptured by it. Highly recommend as something to do in the Antalya area - a good rainy day option.",
          "Well worth a visit, despite being a little expensive. They have a huge collection of fish, beautifully and sensitively displayed. Apparently it has the world's longest tunnel aquarium.",
          "Upon entry, photographers will snap your picture and incorporate it on different types of merchandise like plates and magnets that you can collect for a fee at the exit. Fish tanks are well maintained and displayed, also a lot of information to read. They have the biggest tunnel",
          "Cost for 5 adults and 2 under 5 was $400 plus the \u20ac110 Euro for taxis. Aquarium was good the tunnel was also very good. Nice to sit and watch the rays go over you. The 4d cinema was out of sync and not worth a wasted 8 mins. The wild life part on top was empty the reptiles",
          "Good place to visit , lots to see. Easy accessible from old town by bus or taxi. Nice coffee shop on way out.",
          "Amazing samples of fishes, different sea and ocean spices. Very easy to rich from city center and old city Kaleici by bus or private transport. Beautifully planned, Tunnels, samples of cars and planes from war times that drawn during the war, so scary a bit as well. Rather",
          "I did not go into the aquarium because when we were ready to pay they only charge in US dollars. Which I found so silly seen as we are in Turkey which requires Turkish Lira. It is better to go if you have children and you have the choice of just the aquarium or you can add the",
          "We paid 150 US$ just for the entrance (2 adults +2 children, 9 and 3 years old). Nothing overly exciting , Dubai aquarium I think is more interesting. Real price should be no more than 10$",

          "Took the kids on a day out although local we have never had the chance to go. We really enjoyed it and would reccommend to all.",
          "We visited late in the season but can honestly say its nothing special, over priced for what it is.... it didnt take long to get round the whole thing! It took longer to walk up the ramp to it! The tunnel is cool but once youve seen that youve pretty much seen it all. We also",
          "There a lot of things to see. The biggest aquarium tunnel in the world. The fish are amazing, space enough for a lit of people. Everyone who visit Antalya should visit this aquarium. I'm surprised eitj the variety of living things. Will visit again sure.",

          "The aquarium has a lot of amazing fish and reptiles to see but it is so sad to see them stuffed in small aquariums with artificial plants and corals. Furthermore, there's nothing special about the place and its overpriced. I only gave 3 stars because most of the kids seemed to",

          "This Aquarium is really pretty! You are not going to see the rarest spices but you will see enough! It can be especially interesting for a kids cause there are many games and adventures to do! There is a beautiful souvenir shop after you leave aquarium and also place to eat!",
          "Fascinating fish types, probably the majority of world fish species exist in one of the multiple aquarium tanks. Aquarium tunnel is large and amazing to walk through.",
          "Had a good morning out at Aquarium, it has the largest walk through overhead aquarium with plenty of different species of fish would recommend for families.",
          "New aquarium, not to far from Migros 5 ( shopping mall) do remember that if you go by bus you get of at Migros & walk to the main road & then continue around the mall to get to the entrance of the aquarium ( a good 10 minutes walk) Aquarium itself is neatly build: for once",
          "I went there with my family the aquarium doesn't offer so much to sea and has few kind of fish they charge 35$ per person which is too high and this place doesn't worth paying this amount for it where a person pays such amount for just half an hour because its too small and",
          "I think not expensive, we saw four different area (aquarium-snowland-cinema-wild park) all of them was perfect just wild park need more lights. Snowland and cinema good idea for kids. Everybody should saw here. Have a nice trip guys!!",

          "The title says it all really. The aquarium is part of a complex featuring a 'snow world' play area and 'wildlife' centre but this review is purely based on the aquarium as we didn't visit the other areas. A whopping \u00a353 for 2 adults to get in, glad I don't have kids! That's",
          "Good to see but i really don't recommand to pay for that. The price was extremely expensive with the boat, you can do it by earth",

          "We enjoyed it there. Lots of sealife to see. The tunnel is very long. We took some nice pics there. They take a pic of you when your going in, then you can buy at a reasonable price at the end. Not a bad afternoon out theres a mcdonalds there too. You can get a taxi right",
          "we went there in the morning and it wasnt as good as i hoped its more for kids than adults .... if ur a family with kids go if not stay away its expansive and for no point ... didnt enjoy it ..",

No way!!Above all sharks are extremely small.There are interesting wrecks and type of fishes from all around the world.Staff is helpful enough, prices are a bir pricy but not that much.I would say you can visit it once",
          "This is a nice place to visit but very expensive. there is a tunnel with larger fish. we got there before 12 clock to see the sharks being fed an it was so packed we actually missed it. when purchasing your tickets do not purchase the 4d Cinema its not worth it, its 8 mins long",
          "Not much variety in the tunnel, mainly big fish and stingrays with a few small sharks! The poor sea lions pool was also filthy and sparse...not recommended",
          "This is a good place to visit especially with children. I paid 72 euros for entry for 2 adults 2 children. The price was discounted as I had reserved tickets online. There is Mcdonalds right outside the aquarium.",

          "It was a wonderful trip to the tunnel aquarium,one of the biggest tunnel aquariums in the world,with a variety of fish,sharks,water snakes,crabs etc.Ticket price for the aquarium was 45 euro per person.There were many guests from different countries.At the end of the visit,there",

          "Nothing much to say but \u00a3120 for a aquarium that we were in for 1hr and 20 mins and we were not rushing ! Also only foreigners get charged this ..save your money really not worth the cost",
          "We enjoyed . It's exciting for children but not a teenager, with a lot of different fish and sharks. The place is worth the money if you took the full package.",
          "We did the Full package which gave us access to aquarium, snow world, Ocean ride XD and wild park reptile house... Aquarium has some really nice tanks with great props in them including a plane, mini, part of a shipwreck and submarine... snow world was fun especially as it was",

          "Compared to other aquariums it is incredible expensive. \"World longest under water tunnel\" must be a joke, as the one in Copenhagen seems much longer. Uninterested staff that spoke poorly English, and did not correct visitors who obviously mistreated the fish and animals by",

          "Although it is very expensive, the children enjoyed it very much. It was very quiet so maybe special offers to all not just locals would probably bring more visitors. \u00c7ok pahali olmasina ra\u011fmen, \u00e7ocuklar \u00e7ok sevdi. Gayet sesizdi, belki kampanyalar yapilsa herkes i\u00e7in daha \u00e7ok",

          "Can't be compared to Dubai Mall Aquarium, you need 30 to 45 mn to finish it, extremely expensive (500+ Lira just for the aquarium visit for 2 adults and 3 children), limited species, small sharks.",
          "The aquarium visit was a nice one. Plenty fish species. Very big spaces so you will not feel crowded. Very clean and i was happy to find also clean toilets inside. Like most turkish sights, plenty opportunities to spend money inside on snacks or souveniers.",

          "We booked thru TUI and this was part of a shopping day tour in Antalya It was good but not overly great. Ideal for kids. They have reptile world, snow world and 4DX film too. It had the world's longest aqua tunnel Our trip only included entry to aquarium but we paid 40 lira",
          "Great place but very expensive with the usual hard push to get photos taken. Kids loved it though and good experience",
          "Well it is an interesting place for children, the tunnel is long and interesting. They took 447 TL for 2 adults and 2 children just for the aquarium visit. The lady who works at the ticket office was not helpful she doesn't answer questions like how much it will take to visit",
          "Was a place where me and my family was feeling good.We like fishes and this was a relaxing day.Also was good on 43 degrees to play with the snow.",
          "It was a nice experience for the kids who were 3 to 6 years. They say its the biggest underwater tunnel in the world but i doubt. The sharks they have are small and my kids wanted 2 c a big shark but nevertheless they had so much fun.",

          "We visited the aquarium after booking with Thomas Cook tours at the hotel. We took a private tour because we were 3 families and wanted the bus for ourselves. The aquarium was alright. The range of sea life they have is good but I've honestly seen a wider range in kuwait",
          "Great place to visit!This is a must see definitely!Lot of fish tanks and aquariums with different sorts of fish.Never was so close to shark.Wonderful experience.",

          "How can they possibly justify 129Tl per person for just the aquarium. The other 'attractions' are extra and....the reptile house, the dolphinarium and the snowland........all similarly priced. Makes or a VERY expensive day out. Needless to say we went no further than the ticket",
          "The aquarium was rather overpriced! Reasonably good collection. Must attend the FEEDING OF FISH (around 1300 hrs). A man descends into water and start feeding the fish. All kinds of fish surround him. Separate ticket for the cinema at the top level (not worth it). Good Italian",
          "Nice place to visit in Antalya city and great chance to see so many exotic animals. Also it is a great acvity for kids but a bit expensive. If you are looking for an indoor activity for kids, go for it!",

          "If u like fish and sea creatures that s just for you. I strongly recommend that you should visit it at the time of sharks lunch, which is nearly 12.30 pm. The diver is great and makes a show while feeding them.",

          "It is a OK place to be when there is nothing to do. It was almost no one there when we went. It is NOT worth the price if you get a foreign rate, it is almost acceptable if you get a citizen/ local rate. We have been the way better aquariums e.g. So even disappointing for a 5",

          "Beware when you want to go to the antalya aquarium... they charge non locals ( have to show turkish id) about 3.5 times as much as locals... the entry price is 42 dollar for tourists and 42 lira for locals. Aquarium is nice, almost no real corals however :( Nice to combine",
          "Great visit, but pay attention at the ticket office of the aquarium, pay only the official price! We visited the Aquarium last week. We like to visit as locals, and avoid to take an organized tour. So we went to the Aquarium by public transport.We took thebus to 5 Migros, and",
          "The place is very nice but it is very expensive, my visit was in July 2013 . The place has 4-5 international restaurants. In general the only comment that it doesnt worth 75$ per person",
          "Has lot of fish and other marine species. It's Very expensive though. Perhaps keep it for rainy day if any.",
          "Interesting only for children!Didnt impress too much!Actually i saw much more interesting such kind of places...",
          "went because my child love sharks, wasn't disappointed, there is a large under water tunnel that is beautiful. a little expensive .",
          "Good. Area looks small. Very less activity for children. location is very good. Wild park, 5d cinema and snow world is average. Not to expect a lot.",
          "The aquarium is big, with the longest tunnel in the world. The verity of fish is not so big, but the decoration is very nice. At 12:00 there was a shark fiddling (I don\u2019t know if happens every day) which was interesting.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this biggest aquarium We discovered a lot of beautiful and important things there The cinema was so amazing Everything in this place was good and great",
          "I have been to more than 7 aquariums world wide and this is the second best aquarium (doesn't contain jellyfish) that I've been to but the first aquarium with the best tunnel. The information tags available at each type of fish is awesome and descriptive. Worth visiting.",
          "It's a rip off, simple. They charge diff amounts to visit the diff parts of the place. And it's tiny It's a rip off",
          "This is relatively expensive at c. \u00a335 each. But just about worth it as undoubtedly this new aquarium has been built to impress, particularly the underwater tunnel - the largest in the world and you won't forget it in a hurry due to its various staged pieces/diaroma's.",
          "We went to the aquarium which we found quite expensive it's great but not as big as we had expected was done in less than and hour but was still a lovely experience",
          "Amazing place! U can find so many different species of animals in the sea. We enjoyed our visit here. :)",

          "Beautiful aquarium with so much to see, it houses one of the best tunnels in the world with so many sharks, had great fun with my family",
          "over priced, Turkey is a great place to visit my reason is its respect for handicapped people and the elderly where ever you go in its public places the special treatment and prices are visible and available , Not in this place This place had more people working in it than",
          "It was way better then I expected. Very well organized, plenty of animals, very clear aquariums, nice shows and much more. It is a must see place in Antalya.",
          "On the west side of Antalya city center this Aquarium is very beautiful, it shwos a lot of maritim spieces and a very long tunel where you can take a lot of photos. My 2 kids loved this place and were dazzled by the variety of the fishes espasially the sharks.",
          "We went there in September. I expected it to be breath taking, well it wasn't. The entrance fee is abnormally high in comparison to what you can see there. Yes, there s a tunnel which looks nice and a few decorations, varieties of fish, there s also a Wild part(which has a",
          "The aquarium is big, and has the longest underwater tunnel. I've been to the Philadelphia aquarium, so this one was not good on my sights. It has a lot of different fishes, but the sharks are not the biggest ones. The ticket was very expensive for what they were showing (35",
          "The Antalya aquarium is a great experience however a bit on the expensive side. You can enjoy the tranquility as long as you don't walk in on a crowded day such as weekends or weekday tourist tours.",
          "A was in Antalya this summer , I visited the aquarium , really is very fantastic , there is a some made of fishes , the sky is also very good , I passed a best monument in this place .",
          "When entering there are a lot of Salt water aquariums from different regions with beautiful colored fishes. The tunnel is long but not that special but having sharks and rays swimming over you is impressive",
          "Definitely go to the aquarium it was a very nice experience. Sharks, Rays and Piranhas! Just understand, there are two prices, one for foreigners and one for Turks. I was puzzled when they would not accept Turkish Lira from me and wanted my credit card, however my Turkish",
          "First of all, it is very expensive to enter (obviously it might be only for me).The aquarium we imagined was a lot more different. It can be the biggest tunnel aquarium in the world however the size of the sharks were really disappointing.l would rate this section 3 out of 5",
          "It's the largest tunnel aquarium I ever seen. There are many different fishes to see, and in the aquarium are many decorations of sunk ships and so on.",
          "The place is nice and clean, however you wouldn't see any unusual creatures, and the only guidance available are the signs. Most of the fishes are in normal tanks and the tunnel which is claimed to be the largest in the world is so shallow that you can see the water surface.",
          "The Place has a design as Arch't Frank Gehry's styles... The place is so clean and organize... You would enjoy the trip to there ...",
          "Children will enjoy the most. Entry Ticket is very costly. Environment was good. We ground some rare fishes species",
          "I paid 168$ for 4 adults and 1 child 5 years old to watch the fish and small sharks. I prefer to pay this amount on a rafting.",
          "The worlds biggest underwater shark tunnel was the selling point for us but was so confused when we manage to walk to the end in less than 20 mins( with toilet break) Wouldn't go back and wouldn't really recommend if your just going to the aquarium.",
          "Huge and beautiful aquarium. It was here in September 2012, immediately after its opening in August. Located at the foot of the mountains, very conveniently located near the amusement park and a large shopping center in Antalya area. At 70 meters from the beach, located akvar\u0456um",
          "For a family of 4 this cost 576 Lira! just over \u00a3150! Prices are all in dollars so you don't really know what your up against! We stood and worked out the cost before entering but decided to pay this to go in as my daughter desperately wanted to visit here and we were already",
          "A good look around for an hour only, some good exhibits and the tunnel is good. Too expensive really. 35 USD for adults. 27 USD for under 12 years old, free I think for kids under 3.",
          "Good place to spend 2 to 3 hours, specially if you are looking for A family venue. I personally have seen better collection of sea life and more complex exhibits, but it was nevertheless interesting for the kids. It is good for A change of pace and A chance to enrich family",
          "this place is nice and better with the snow world,different kind of fishs seperated for the places they live ,we liked.3 hours is enough.but at the web site they do not tell the prices.",
          "35$ for less then 1 hour :(, there are very few species, small sharks ... this attraction worth 35 TL and not $35 ...",
          "They claim it to be the biggest in the world, am not so sure about it for I have a lot of tunnel aquariums, it is pretty big but not so much of fish collections like the others I've seen. Still nice place to see with families specially the ones with kids. Included on the ticket",
          "We are family with 2 teenagers and 2 babies with nanny, we went there 11:30 am and that was great as they told us the shark feeding is 12:00 pm , it's very nice place to spend 2-3 hours , the tunnel is awesome , the gift shop is unique we bought t-shirt (black&white) which turns",
          "the aquarium is nice but not interactive, not much to do , a good alternative would be Turkuazoo in Istanbul for those visiting Istanbul. we paid 28 euros for the entrance fee which was cheaper than initially advertised (\u20ac50) , there are a variety of fish to see if you are",
          "The aquarium is ok, certainly nothing special compared to similar places around the world. Overpriced too.",
          "They have quite a few activities along with aquarium. Like a snow play area, a wild park, and off course the aquarium. We took a combo of wild park and aquarium. I remember our total bill was 477 liras for 2 adults and 2 kids (8 year, 6 year), don't remember the individual",
          "I was slightly disappointed, was expecting bigger in all honesty! Didn't take long to walk through. Thought the shop however was a massive hit",
          "This place sounds and looks good but they do not state the entry fee anywhere on their website or at the aquarium itself. This is clearly to dupe foreigners into paying hiked up costs as compared to locals. When you go to the ticket office and they realise you are not local they",
          "A long tunnel but nothing to see there, just some small fish. A waste of time and money, at the entrance a group of Russians are doing their business and almost oblige visitors to be photographed, they don't understand \"no\"",
          "Though we took some beautiful snaps and there were some interesting species of fish, there was no interactive aspect to the aquarium. It was more like walking around a museum. It took us less than 1.5 hours to get round the whole place. It didn't really cater for any age group",
          "From the moment you arrive you are mesmerised by the variety of sea life on show. The tanks are well thought out from sunken cars to aircraft and back to ancient ruins. Plus you get to stroll through a really long glass tunnel whilst fish swim around you and above you. Brilliant",
          "Fantastic day here with the kids, lots of fish and you can see the Sharks close up. The tunnel was great, the divers were cleaning the tanks and blew kisses at my daughters, which they loved! Really well looked after place. We also went to the snow zone afterwards which was",
          "This aquarium is outstanding - there are numerous individual tanks before you get to the tunnel, which goes around a very large tank containing sharks and more. We saw the sharks being fed, which the kids loved. We also went to the reptile habitat, which was pretty good as well,",
          "My boys had great fun at the aquarium and loved the sharks, especially feeding time. Would recommend a visit",
          "it says that is the longest water tunnel from the world! the tunnel is really long and looks nice. Species diversity is not high as expected and a bit too pricey (35usd/adult and 25usd/kid, max 12 years). souvenir shop looks great and demand is quite large",
          "Variate selection of fish and reptiles, the acquarium tube is very interesting having fish swiming over your had, many decorations (old car, natural size plane and shipreck); it also has a frozen room of -5c very interesting to spend time there when 40c outside. It may be a bit",
          "it a very nice place to take your kids, but they main issue is the high prices , all the sections are nice from the reptile to aquarium and the cinema and the snow area but the prices should be really reviewed",
          "I visited the aquarium with a group of families with kids. It is very expensive and highly overpriced. 70$ per person and 64$ for kids for less than 2 hours of visits. I visited around 10 aquariums around the world and this is the worst, and by far. Not recommended at all. The",
          "Visited due to thunderstorm but glad we did very well set out, the walk through tunnel area is impressive with well thought out flow to keep you walking through. Says no photos but everyone seemed to ignore this. We even found Dory",
          "It's 35usd just to enter the aquarium never mind the add ons. For this price it is a lackluster attraction. Notting new to see if you have ever been to a similar attraction elsewhere.",
          "I was here couple days ago .. My travel agency organised that trip .. It's very interesting place to visit.. You have a lot fishes, sharkes and other seas animal to see.. Here is the biggest aqua tunel In the Europe and I think on the world is third .. So I'm in love with this",
          "Really nice aquarium with lots of interesting species of fish and very well presented. Water tunnel is great. Enjoyed sliding down the snow in the snow city in it.",
          "We had a package aquarium and a wild park. Aquarium it self was really good. Love the way fish tanks are set all different themes. Tunnel is great too. Wild park is not that great few snakes, lizards and other crawlies. This for 2 of us cost 89 Euros. If you want snow room and",
          "Expensive for a lackluster attraction. I have seen way better aquariums. Yeah the tunnel was cool but the exhibits were just not that impressive. NO jelly fish, almost no sharks and poor selection of marine life. Honestly, I would not go there or recommend it.",
          "Overpriced overrated not worth the money I found the aquarium in Blackpool more entertaining. It took us 10 mins to go around the whole aquarium.",
          "I read about this very much, and finaly we go there!!! If you visiting Antalya, you shoud go to see this Aquarium! :)",
          "We visited Aquarium with our 3-year old daughter. We made the tour in 1,5 hour. The ticket is valid only to Aquarium, does not include all the 3 exhibition. Tickets are little bit pricey. There are several fish tanks, some nicely decorated. The tunnel was nice, we could watch",
          "This truly is a very nice experience. I have seen other Aquariums but the tunnel in here was very nice and long. The variety of fish is ok but some very interesting fish kissing ( bubble fish, other types if sharks, more types of octopus etc) in general a must visit place.",

          "After having been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, I must say the Antalya one is just terrible. It's just a big space with tacky fish tanks that pretends to be educational. It is overpriced (US$35 per person) and the experience overall is just truly disappointing. Not worth your",

          "We went to Phaselis on the local bus, just let the bus driver know and he makes the detour to the entrance to the park. It is still being excavated so the fee of 20 tl per person is well worth it. It is around a kilometre down to the site where there is a place to buy",
          "We arrived from our hotel via local bus which cost around \u00a31.20 each. Just a few pounds to get in. Once past the gates there is a good 10-15 min walk to one of the coves and some ruins. There is a lake nearby filled with fish, frogs and turtles. Just another short walk to",
          "Popped down here for a few hours and looked around. Not much to say other than BEAUTIFUL!! It really is stunning and well worth the small entry fee. Couple of hours is enough to look around but if you take your speedos you could be there all day! The covers are amazing!",

          "I loved this place: the most idyllic and pleasant sea swimming you'll do in Europe I'd wager. There are supposedly better-preserved ruins elsewhere in Turkey but I really felt I could picture the Romans going about their dignified business here. The ticket is well worth the",

          "Just some kilometers from our hotel, these ruins attracted us very much: quiet and all the parts a city needs: houses, bath house, main street, theatre etc. Both harbours (bays) on either side of the city were fun to visit (and swim in!) Expecially the big bay: the clearest",
          "We brought a group including 18 kids for a day of exploring the ruins and swimming. It was a wonderful experience. It was probably my 6th time there and it never disappoints. The city is interesting enough, including an aqueduct system, a theater, and an interesting story of",

          "This site is worth the visit on a number of levels. Firstly there are the historical ruins that many find fascinating. But for the sun worshippers then the beach is the icing on the cake. The sand stretches away into the distance and it is clear and sandy, unlike the stones",

          "I was there last weekend, not crowded and not bad. But i think that's higher price 20TL. Though i didn't pay that much becauee i have Turkish friend. If i would pay 20TL, i would be back home. Otherwise, walking seeing that scenary is nice.",
          "Been there on public transport.7(Dolmush) Close to Tekirova with nice landscapes. 20 TRY enterance fee. I enjoyed so much to walk from the Phaselis enterance to the Phaselis coast. I'll recommend to waer walking shows if you go by Dulmush. Also remind to rake sub glass and use",

          "Its very easy to reach from Kemer, need to take just one bus which cost 2$. Entrance cost 20lyras or 6e, but its worth it. The picture from amfiteatre is beautiful. To swim in that worm water in such a nice place is unforgettable! The biggest minus we was in time when in Turkey",

          "The city gives you a good idea about what the original city must have looked like. Hadrian's gate and the Agora are especially striking. The only downside is the cost of drinks and food there. One can of Coke is 8 Lira! Make sure to bring your own food and drinks. There's",

          "Wonderful if you like historical sights. It had three bays and used to be an important trading city. It also has great toilets",
          "We spent the morning here and it was a remarkable place to visit. Public transport from Tekirova is available and drops you off just outside the site. A short walk down a tree lined road and you come across amazing sights which give a real insight into life at that time. Well",
          "Ancient town like in your imaginery. Even alexander the great stopped there for months because of the nice saunas and the women.. Has three sunken harbours, in each you can swim very nice, wonderful beaches with forest behind. The village people and origins from arround come",
          "We accessed this ancient site by following the Lycian Way along the coast for a couple of hours from Tekirova. There were a few tricky bits en route but never dangerous. The city itself is situated right on the coast and has three harbours. A wide street runs through the middle",
          "Not much of the buildings still standing,however that said what,s there gives a good impression.The main attraction is the three lovely bays it is built round and the backdrop of the pine forest,very peaceful.",
          "In terms of natural beauties and archeological assets, I strongly recommendt you to visit to Phaselis.",

          "Wonderful place to visit with 3 beaches. Can be reached by boat or bus to the entrance and walk down to the city. I found it very interesting. There is also a cafe and shop and also toilets. Well worth a visit. We paid 10 Turkish lira entrance fee which was very cheap.",

          "Really liked Phaselis for the ruins, beautiful setting and was very quiet when we visited. If you have time and like walking it is worth walking around the Necropolis to the north of the main site as great walk through the trees and you come across quite a few sarcophagus in an",
          "Took the local bus and paid entrance of TRY10. We walked down the coniferous pathway and was enthralled by the lovely bay and the ruins and history in this place. Lovely place to explore the amphitheatre, Hamas and to spend half a day. Guard at the end of the beach was very",
          "This is probably the most beautiful place I have ever I have ever visited. The location is idyllic on the southern Turkish coast. An ancient Roman city ruin smaller than many better well known sites but with just as much of interest. Three Agoras, a theatre, three harbours,",
          "This is a beautiful, peaceful Roman site. You can still walk across the ancient Roman road. We stayed at the Euphoria hotel in a village called Tekirova and outside the main gate it was possible to get the Dolmus (mini bus) which takes you to Phaeselis for around the equivalent",
          "Unlike many of the Graeco-Roman sites in Turkey, Phaselis Is little visited. It sits on a headland, covered in fine pine trees, and fringed by the silted remains of its once important harbours. Some work has been done to uncover the massive remains, but it all seems half",
          "The old Rom,an port Phaselis is well worth a visit. Interesting to wander among ruins, partly taken over by ruins, partly excavated.",
          "Phaselis is a truly beautiful ruin, nestled amongst the trees and surrounded by the sea. There is much more to see here than our guidebook inferred and with almost no people in November it was peaceful and a delight. Had we known how lovely it was in advance we would have",
          "There are several greek/roman ruin cities along the Turkish coast. Phaselis is of particular interest in my opinion, and for 2 reasons: First: There are not so many tourists here, much space at the beach when you are tired of looking at stones. Secondly and the most important:",
          "loved this place, took a taxi from hotel,in short it is the remains of the old town with ampitheatre,but also a good place for snorkeling,very relaxed with wide bay and pine trees, visited twice. tip - take food and drink with you, and have a swim",
          "We visited this Roman city as part of another trip and had limited time here. How I wish I had longer! Whilst this is a ruin, it is though the town folk walked away after the earth quake and this is how it has remained. You are allowed to climb and walk around the town as it is",
          "A fascinating ancient site. Alexander the great spent a winter here in 333B.C. He had taste. The site has a plethora of monuments and a great ambiance due to the fact that there are few tourists. The beach at the far end of the town (South harbour) is extensive and empty, plus",
          "If you like history you've got to check this place out. 1 hour from Antalya the ruins are thousands of years old... Add to this the view of Mt. Olympos and the turquoise beaches to cool down in after walking around and it's a good day out. I recommend going another 10 min down",
          "A very interesting place to see and well worth the visit, the entry fee is very good, and whether or not you're interested in archaeology, I'd pay a visit. The ruins are very interesting and the surrounding landscapes are spectacular.",
          "Phaselis is a great place to visit, even if you aren't interested in archaeology (like myself) it's very enjoyable to see and also to learn about the ancient history of the city. We visited in the morning, so it was nice and peaceful and we could explore more and also take some",
          "This antic town coming from Roman Empire times is worth to visit when you stay around. Its beach is wonderful as well.",
          "Nice surrounding, nice beach. The ruins itself made the environment very much enjoyable. Not too many people.",

          "I have been in this quiet old city with my family in August 2015 for a couple of hours full of history and a great chance to swim in crystal warm water. The sea and the weather were great that day. Don't miss a chance to being there and try to go up with the cable car to tahtali",
          "Went here as part of the Sea to Sky excursion. Thoroughly enjoyed the ruins, hard to believe they are 2000 years old. As usual for this area you need water shoes as the beach is stones not sand. Water lovely, good for snorkelling. Try standing still in the water, the little",
          "Superb site, nice beach. An awesome choice for beach lovers, history geeks and seekers of calm. The only set back is the fact that the site is closed on evenings and nights.",
          "I only got to visit this over a 40 min break from a boat trip- shame as didn't make the most of it. Reasonably impressive ruins next to the sea, but a lovely place to come and have a picnic. Worth taking some time on a lovely day to properly look around and sit at the beach with",
          "I tend to find most ruins a little boring, but this was really good. You can get really close and climb all over the ruins, plus you can go for a great swim amongst it all. The amphitheatre was very well preserved and the whole place is nice to walk around, quite a step up",
          "Good place not just to see antique city but also spend all day on their beaches. There are no sunbeds or umbrellas but a lot of trees. You can go by local bus that stops at the entrance (make sure to tell driver just one word - Phaselis). It is about 1 km from entrance to the",

          "An amazing few hours of delighting in ancient ruins. the main street is so well preserved it really transports you back in time. There are three bays around the site so remember to take swim wear as it's nice to have a dip in the crystal clear waters.",
          "The very historical and in the same time romantic, calm, beautifull place where a lot of civilzations meet. I think nowadays people must have something beautifull in life and this in one of the places in the world that make our life beautiful.",

          "Just imagine that you are swimming in the port of an ancient city. Yes you can. You can lay your towel under the fir trees and enjoy a relatively warm sea after your trip in the ancient city. Phaselis has 3 different ports where you can swim and all port have different types of",

          "Great place with historic feelings, we spent there only one afternoon, but we enjoyed the shallow sea even 25m from beach, also the view of Olympos is very nice from here.",
          "Ancient Roman harbour city from 700BC. Today, a few columns are all that remain of the temple but there is still much to see that evokes the city's former splendor. A tiered theater, built into the slope of a hill, seated for thousands.",
          "Busloads of crowds and their guides will show up soon enough. By arriving @ opening time; however, you will have approximately 45 minutes to an hour to enjoy this wonderful ancient city in relative quietude. We loved it.",
          "This ancient city was absolutely fascinating. There was shade in the parking lot, important because the September temperatures were in the upper 90s and 100s. We drove there first thing in the morning and were actually the first customers of the day. We had a window of maybe 45",
          "Lovely day out beautiful roman ruins and scenery tour guide gave a really interesting tour with lots of information and facts well worth the trip.",
          "Nice day out very interesting reading about the sight there is also three beaches at phaselis so you can spend the whole day there and it cost about two pounds per person for entry.",
          "Visited Phaselis off our own back. We got the dolmus there and it drops you at the entrance. There is a bit of a walk to the harbours and ancient road, so be prepared. It was interesting walking the main road of an ancient city and the posts advising what was what, were",
          "Lovely site to visit, a good hot walk (remember to bring some water) and you can go swimming when you're done. Showers close to the toilet area so you can rinse off after you're done swimming and little cafe area so you can buy drinks and food for your walk.",
          "Nice to witness some bits of history. Not quite Ephasus, but a good insight. Beaches not as nice as I hoped, but overall ok outing.",
          "This place is worth visiting, and take your kids with you! Beautiful ancient walls, amazing amphitheater, sea shore. You won't regret!",
          "how wonderful it was to swim so close to the ruins we had a sunbath on a ruin stone. trees are touching the water. the three old harbors are very clean and attractive for swimming we choose the largest one on the west the water was warm and could walk a long distance touching",
          "Phaselis used to be a major port of trade and commerce during the Roman and Ottoman empires, but due to the regions earthquakes, much of it has been ruined. What does remain are the baths that were erected at the gates of the city, as well as a colosseum where gladiators fought",
          "Phaselis was an ancient greek and roman city ranged on a peninsula surrounded by three small , beautiful harbours , within the grounds of a beautiful natural park . You must visit this place during the high season early in the morning when it is less crowded . You can walk along",

          "Phaselis takes you to centuries ago with its destroyed stone buildings. The sea and beach is very beautiful.",
          "We enjoyed the trip to Phaselis which we did by hire car. 30 euros per day cheaper for 4 people than hiring a taxi",
          "It is a great archaeological site to visit however do not forget to get you swim suites etc as it has one of the great beaches in the area. I would highly recommend to pay a visit",
          "Beautifully located in a calm bay, this antique city started as a Rhodian colony, through being a part of Alexander the Great's Empire and a pirate strong hold and then gradually developed under Roman rule. The ruins are well preserved and give an impression of the lay out of",
          "Here is a special place! Even you close your ears and don't know anything about this place before you go. In your first step you will feel from your heart that Phaselis is whispering to you. Keep going between high trees, keep going in the main hall of this ancient city, keep",
          "most of elements of the antique city are well preserved (forum, bath, amphitheatre, aqueduct, harbor, etc) despite of care of authorities (just a free area where everyone can walk anywhere). It is also a very nice spot to spend the afternoon on a beautifull small beach",
          "We had great fun exploring the ruins. It is a really fascinating attraction and definitely worth a visit if you like history. The detail on some of the doorway arches is amazing and it's a wonder how they managed to build things like that with their bare hands. The ruins lead",
          "The place is beautiful but misses some infrastructure like cafes. But there is a nice fish restaurant if you drive a bit further (leaving Kemer and Phaselis behind your back). And yeah the beach is very shallow, you have to walk like 50 meters before you can swim.",
          "Well worth stopping for an hour to tour this fascinating historic site. We came via a boat tour, I'm glad I chose to look around rather than swim.",
          "We hired a private taxi to take us to Phaselis for the day for just 200 lira. The ruins and ancient theater were like something you would see in Athens but you can climb all over these ruins. The bay's are beautiful and the water was amazing. There is even a fresh water shower",
          "Very lovely place to visit and have a peaceful day at, we have been there loads of times, it is a bit of a walk down from the bus stop but all in all, that's just a very small glitch.. The beach where we go is never packed, and we seem to be the only ones who go there... Sitting",
          "The ruins are interesting and worth a visit.The bays are OK for swimming etc but not spectacular.Make sure you bring your own food and drink because the kiosk is very over priced. Finally if you come by public bus from Antalya, it takes around 90 minutes, not the 40, that the",
          "Phaselis Antique City is a must-see if you visit Antalya. You can also enjoy a warm sea bath in one of its three antique harbours.",
          "We felt that the ruins and beautiful sea views were diminished by all of the garbage and cigarette butts thrown anywhere and everywhere. It's really a shame to see such disregard and disrespect.",
          "We visited Phaselis and we're really impressed. It is a fairly small site, easily managed in a morning, and has really good remains of the Main Street, baths and the viaduct, which is still in really good condition with the arches intact. There are a few little coves where you",
          "Guys, you need to go there\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc It's the most beautiful place which we saw before!!! Sea and forest! The best duet, best place in Tekirova! Amazing views, amazing water and air! Historical and fascinating place!",

          "We stopped by here on our way to Kalek\u00f6y. It was a highlight. Ruins of an ancient city scattered over a peninsula that doubles as a sun and fun beach spot. Festive atmosphere, as well as very interesting ruins: a theater, numerous commemorative markers, baths, agora...And",
          "Phaselis is beautiful ancient city in small forest. There is well preserved amphitheater, agora, hamam and other places. You can also swimm there in clean and hot cove. It\u00b4s better visit Phaselis during a week, on weekends it\u00b4s quite crowded with many locals.",

          "There are historical ruins and there are historical ruins and this one was incredible. Set by the most beautiful looking area of the Mediterranean sea and with the backdrop of the mountains behind lie the most amazing Roman ruins I've seen. There is an aqueduct, Roman road, bath",

          "We took the local bus to Phaselis as it was only 10 minutes from our hotel, 3.50TL each and 10 TL to get in. You have to walk a way down the forest road but it was shady and pleasant! The place was amazing, you must climb to the back row of the amphitheater and look at the view,",
          "Nice short stop for the beach and admiring old ruins in the forest with lovely sea views, closes at 7 so you need to plan ahead",

          "We've visited a fair few ruins in Turkey over the years, these are quite possibly the best we've seen (not been to Ephesus yet). It is quite easy to see what the city would have looked like - stretching between a north and a south harbour a wide road with temples, shops, baths",
          "Interesting but busy! Get here early if you want to avoid the crowds! Small cafe with a limited selection of food and drinks-bring something along if you're picky.",
          "Interesting place. Jammed with families picnicing on the beaches. If you want to sim, get here early.",
          "One of the best places I've found. Quiet and tranquil with two gorgeous bays to walk between with ancient and well-preserved ruins around you. If you're staying close, spend an afternoon here.",

          "A great site to see in an afternoon. The place is not overly large but worth the trip and the small hike to see. You could probably easily camp within the ruins if you wanted to and i regret not trying it out. The views across the bays were magnificent. Worth a look.",
          "The ancient city of Phaselis was so wonderful we visited it twice. Before entering the car park there is a small charge. The ruins of Phaselis are dotted along three little bays. The beaches here are wonderful and the water shallow, which is great for families. There are showers",
          "We rent a car from Kemer to get to this place. It's really worth to visit. Read the history of this city. Phaselis has been ruled by different rulers, Persian Empire, Alexnader, Seljukes and Romans.",
          "Phaselis is certainly a must see for anyone traveling in the neigbourhood. It is located near Tekirova on the road between Kemer and Cirali-Olimpos. First time I was there, was back in 2004 and at that time you had the site almost completely for yourself. Tourism has increased",
          "Phaselis site is on coast with few short rocky beaches. Ruins are well preserved and whole place is much older than another similar place in Side which I was visiting last year. In compare with Side here is more to see and observe but its definitely smaller. There are no",
          "There are 2 bays to swim in, a sizable car park, a small lake and invariably a number of boats moored in the bay. It is a scenic forest/bay location so is an attractive stopping point even without the attraction of the historic ruins The remains of the paving of old 7th century",

          "First of all, you can easily reach Phaselis by public transport. There is an Antalya-Tekerova bus which will leave you close to the entrance. Second of all, the ruins are spread over a larger area than I imagined and the way nature is cohabiting with them is absolutely",
          "Once can see why Alexander the Great came here and decided to stay for a while before marking on. The pine scented location by the bay is the location of Greek and Roman ruins by the seaside. The amphitheatre is in fairly good condition and with a view of the hills that",

          "The beach does not have sand but pebbles and there are long stretches of wild seas and no lifeguards. Being a strong swimmer, I swam through the strong shoreline dumpers to 3/4 m swells but almost drowned trying to return! There are a few coffee shops and isolated restaurants",
          "Unike Lara that has sand, this beach has rocks and pebbles but not big huge boulders. Small pebbles that you can walk on and can access the beach. There isn't too much to do here except go in the water for a swim or get a tan. The water is very clear but very salty!",
          "The biggest beach in AYT next to the seaside road. Lots of tourists visit this area but has rocks under water. Kemer or Side has better swimming areas",

          "Easy to reach from Antalya. Take nostalgia tram towards museum and get off at last stop. Tram fee is 1.25 tl each. Staff were kind and friendly. Plenty of space. Not your typical sandy beach. If you don't mind the pebbles, this is perfect if you are staying in Antalya.",
          "very clean sea, great for swimming in. The beach is very pebbly and hard on your feet. Much prefer soft sand. Some parts clean but then let down with litter and dog muck which is a shame because it has massive potential. nice little restaurants that are very affordable. If",
          "Beautiful beach, although it is not a sandy one I much preferred it to Lara Beach. The parks that run along Konyaatli beach are also very beautiful - sure calls for a picnic!",

          "If you have never been to a rock beach, this is the one to visit. The water is warm and green and the scenery is lovely. You can rent a chair and umbrella for 10 lira. There are locals walking around selling cheap snacks such as corn on the cob, simits and mussels. All the",
          "Beautiful, clean pebble beach. Plenty of fun for all the family? Lots of night life, with disco and bar.",
          "It is a common beach, nothing special nor good or bad. The usual tourist water sports, private beacheas with bar, drinks and food. The water is clean but with no sand at all, only small rocks and very deep water only a few metters away from the shore.",

          "For 1 1/2 TL cost the tram will take you to the last stop which leads to 'Konyaalti beach'. Off the tram and a short walk down to the beach. Unless your based at a hotel nearby take your own 'parasol/beach equipment, picnic ect. There are facilities there which are all part of",
          "A nice change from sand. Extends forever and plenty of place to grab, even when crowded. The water is clear and beautiful. When it's calm, join the people swimming way out from the coast. Almost as smooth as a swimming pool when the conditions are right. Just simply beautiful.",
          "Konyaalti Beach was pretty empty for peak season the beach is rather gritty. We were disappointed. There are restaurants but they are pretty basic.",

          "Although I love sandy beaches, i liked Konyaalti more than Lara beach. Konyaalti has small pebbles while Lara beach is all sandy. The pebbles are all very colorful and the beach is less crowded than Lara. In addition to that, the beach has a stunning mountain view. you can also",

          "A long beach and a very nice one. There is many public spots accessible by stairs, and semi-private for hotels located on the other side of the road. Clean and not crowded, it is a nice alternative for people coming from the nearby Antalya, because of the lack of beaches out",
          "When I was reading the reviews I was quite confused, since some people really liked the place, and others hated it. I found it really nice and relatively clean- I think there is huge difference in where you get to the beach. We stayed at the very beginning of the beach in the",
          "We took the tram from Kaleici to Konyaalti, which took us about 20 minutes and costs 1,25 lira per person. After this, you have to walk downhill for another 5-10 minutes to reach the beach. The beach itself was very nice for a relaxing day at sea, although it does consist of",
          "Excellent for families, but a bit far from the old town. The beach is not sandy but with pebbles, but the view is exceptional. Finish off with a local beer!",

          "Konyaalti is 9km long beach, with clean water and not many people around, which is perfect if you want to enjoy sea and sun. Especially alive at night, when lot of people including whole families, come with carpets and prepared food to eat and have a good time till late hours.",

          "As we stayed opposite beach we had no problem in using toilet and shower at appart hotel. Pebbles beach is nice and kept clean. The only problem with public beach there are no sunbeds and umbrellas even for rent. It is better to buy umbrellas and picnic beds in the nearby shops",
          "Just a 15 minute walk from old town. Be aware, no sand at this beach. Mediterranean Ocean was beautiful and great to swim in, but the each from were all rocks which were bot hot and hard on your feet. Besides those items no issue. Next time I would probably go to one of the",
          "The famous public beach in Antalya. Easy access and used to be foods are available for purchase. It is stony though however, it is nice to just seat there and relax or swim of course. There was a small changing room before but I am not sure now really otherwise it is cool to be",
          "Nice beach, but no facilities, like toilet or bar. And we had to leave our pram in a designated area out if sight, which was a risk.",
          "Konyaalti Beach is not an espectacular Beach, considering other ones in Antalya, but the fantastic fact of this beach is that is in the very middle of the city. The Beach has good sercices, like bars, restaurants, WC etc, being the worst part the difficulty to park if you go by",
          "The Konyaalti area of the beach I would not recommend. The steps down to the beach had a long drop on the last step due to the beach having been washed away. Unless you are confident swimmer I would avoid this as the shore drops off very quickly into deep water. The are a",
          "We were on the private part of the beach so it was very quiet, even though it was busiest time of the year everyone had access to free sunbed, which was best option while beach has pebbles. Best to wear protective waterproof footwear. Available atractions on the side inc.jetski.",

          "No sand like other beaches in the area however it's usually quieter than the other beaches. While clean and inviting getting to sea is a challenge as the stones can be a bit sharp in your feet and once in the sea it drops away quite quickly. Still worth a trip for the views if",
          "Konyaalt\u0131 beach is one of the two good and recommended beaches in Antalya city.This beach is with pebbles in various sizes,so you will not be feeling safe enough when you walk over them.Sea is sometimes quiet and sometimes wavy,so it all depends on how lucky you are when you are",
          "Great views, but not sandy like the Lara district or further southwest in Beldibi. The kids refused to walk on it, which was a bummer.",
          "not too far from the old town. we took the bus to get there, but found out it was even more accessible to get there by tram. the beach was down by a cliff. the views from the top of the cliff are amazing. the beach is not a sand beach though. we went in the winter so couldn't",

          "This pebbly beach boasts beautiful views of the Taurus Mountains and is accessible via the Old Tramway or by walking on coastal paths through miniature pine forests from Kaleici (Old Town; about an hour with average photo stops). The beach is made of small stones so wear good",
          "This rock beach on the West side of Antalya is a great place to visit in the summer when all you want to do is find some kind of diversion from the super heated city. The grass park behind the boardwalk is a great place to hang out. Every year a variety of concerts happen in",
          "This beach is one of the best beaches I have visited by far. The best view you can get is late in the afternoon around 4 to 5 pm when the sun is not too bright. It would be worth it as you watch the sunset and enjoy the breeze. We got one of the best views from on top of the",
          "I was new to Turkey and was looking for a nice little get away for an extended weekend. There was a shuttle service that ran all day to and from the beach for less than 4 Turkish Lira (2 US dollars at the time). I particularly love Turkish beaches because you pay a small fee",
          "Nice beach. Pebbly. Warm waters. We had a private section of the beach. Was fairly nice but I don't think I would of taken time to visit this beach if it didn't form part of our hotel. Lara beach is sandy but more busy as a result.",

          "NO! I don't understand why every single beach resort here in the otherwise decent (but still nothing special) central Antalya's Konyaalti beach must forcedly shoot such horrible loud music in your ears. A quiet stay was impossible. Even speaking with friends was difficult. Only",
          "unlike alot of beaches the world over, this is a pebble beach - dont expect sand between your toes but rather some very hot stones - thats not to say that its not a beautiful clean beach - which it is! The water is clean and clear and blue well worth a dip! Theres a million",
          "I was expecting more. It is lovely. The water is stunning and warm but I thought there would be more shops and less junk. You can rent a beach chair for 5 lira and an umbrella for five more. Service was fine at both beach clubs I tried but there was abandoned buildings and",

          "dear all, I want ro make this review as accurate as possible for people who go there to know exactly what to expect. This beach has nothing to do with the wilderness and awesomeness of the Greek beaches. It is an average beach with pebbles, no sand, but you can rent chaise",

          "The beach is large pebbles but gets better the further you go. Its nowhere near as good as Lara beach but this has more places to drink. Bus BL08 goes to Lara beach. Stay on to the terminus. It goes past several shopping centers, takes about 30 minutes and costs 1.75 TL.",
          "I have chosen to make Antalya my base for a few days by the see during Bayram. I understand that this city is probably not the best for its nature but since it is well connected I decided that was good enough. Out of curiosity I still decided to have a look at Konyaalti Beach.",
          "The main thing that bothered me was the loud music. It is a rocky beach, so rent a chair. Swimming is somewhat challenging because the water gets deep close to the shore. I liked the old town beach much better.",
          "quite a nice beach - small size pebbles, much better than in Kemer, where you have to be very brave to overcome large size stones without special shoes.",
          "great! really clean and high class! great view! much better than lara! good discos, good drinks, good view, good service, wonderful beach, what more could one want?",
          "Stone and shingle beach - not sand. Which is OK but it does get deep very quickly with altering currents!!",
          "Being Australian, we are blessed with some wonderful beaches stretched with glistening white sand. This beach is pebbles ranging from small to 3cm. Still, beautiful water and no threat of sharks or jelly fish that can kill you. A tidy compromise!",
          "beware if you are looking for a sandy beach, its all pebbles. The beach shelves into the sea so its hard to get in and out. Its also a strenuous walk from the last tram stop so be prepared.",

          "Basically a two or three mile strip of pebbles of varying width. The further you go West from Antalya town the less developed and crowded it is.Every hundred yards or so there is a Portaloo like changing cubicle for the ladies. Toilets etc at intervals No bars or clubs at the",
          "A great pebble beach - which we reached by tram from the old town of Kalechi. There are a number of beach clubs - where you can hire sunbeds and umbrellas for 10 TL - but make sure you like hardcore dance beats, as they are relentlessly pumped out. You can however go a bit",
          "Konyaalti beach is the most beutiful at sunrise. The weather is not very hot and water is clean because its not crowded. If u want to visit Konyaalti beach do it at the morning ar at night !",

          "The Konyaalti Beach offers a long stretch of beach with access to the Mediterranean. It is clean and populated with a well resourced supply of lounges and umbrellas for rent at 5 TL per day.",
          "Busy, stony dirty and small. It's located next to the busy coastal highway and not far from the Oil Terminal. Give it a miss and visit Lara instead.",
          "The site is quite a sight! :) Make sure there is at least one man with you, as this will impose some respect. I clearly saw the difference between this time and the last one when I was there with my bf. Unfortunately, there are constantly lots of men (younger or older) who stare",
          "The beach is amazing and the views are the best I have ever seen. All this and the fact that it is on the doorstep of the major city of Antalya, make Konyaalti well worth the visit",
          "I really enjoyed Konyalti beach and it was definitely the highligh of my trip to Turkey. Even though it was a pebble (no sand) beach, it had great atmosphere in the evening. Deck chairs laid out for a small charge. The water was warm and very calm. My friends and I spent an hour",
          "Pebbled beach, crystal-clear water with a funny twist: surface-top cm's are cool due to the sources and rivers that pours cold fresh, water to the bay forming a layer of cold fresh water on top of the seawater. Lots of cafes and restaurants and entertainment, lots of sunbeds",
          "Wow what a day, beautiful, moment to always remember, Ed and I took the Tram from Kaleici (cost around 2.5 Turkish liras for two people) quite a short and a pleasant trip! Beautiful view from up above \u2013 the beach is lovely, oh bthw please prepare your self with water shoes due",
          "Nice clear waters and especially very nice below the park, as there are no noice from all the cars passing by. Also very nice restaurants in that area. Public parts have lots of cigarette, sunseed and what ever waste - highly recommendable to set in an effort to make people",
          "West of the old town this beach is easily accessible by tram from the old city.The sea temperature was beautifully refreshing and unusual with the sea temperature at the bottom of the water being warm and the top of the sea being refreshingly cold .This is from the underground",
          "I dislike the pebble beach. rental of deckchairs is possible but the drinks on the beach are expensive.",
          "We stayed at the Hillside Su Hotel which is situated on this beach. It is a pebble beach but the water is so clear! It is absolutely lovely to swim in. It is very deep so kids need to be supervised.",
          "liked everything about this resort and the hotel was extremely fantastic. the anamation team were brillint,moussa,uagr,yasmin and john were most amasing ones there. the intertanment was absoullty fantastic.",
          "You need a good pair of trainers to walk on this beach,it was very dissapointing.No sandcastles on this beach.",
          "The water is clear, but the \"rock\" feeling on your toes and body is sometimes unbearable. Not too crowded.",
          "It\u2019s a pebble beach with crystal clear waters. The beach is approx 15 km long and a lot of areas that you can go swimming in. We went to beach 4 most of the time.",
          "Great beach a short tram away from Kalechi - pebbly with clear waters. Plently of beach cafes to choose - beds and umberella are 10TL each which is the same anywhere. Some have loud party atmosheres if you are looking for that. We opted for the quiet chilled ones instead.",
          "Clear crisp water (very salty). Pebble beach so wear some kind of bath shoes, they're very hot to step on",
          "I confess to being the wrong side of 50 and this is for like-minded people. We only visited part of this beach on the way back from Termessos, but I wouldn't pass the time of day here if you value your eardrums! Every cafe/bar/restaurant was gearing up for the summer season and",
          "Plain beach. Uncomfortable that long to go down to the sea from the road. It's far from old city, and I liked more Mermerli Beach in old city.",
          "If you are in Antalya definitely visit Konyaalti. The beach that you can find many different people.",
          "Certainly not the best beach I've ever been on, but it was nice to just lay out in the sun after spending a few hours at the Antalya Museum across the road.",
          "A pebbly beach but very clean. In the summer months there are many bars and restaurants open and the people are very friendly.",
          "During morning or during sunset, you can go the extra mile having a long walk from side to side of the Konyallti district and see locals and turists enjoying of the beach and the nice coffees near the beach. You can even reach the amazing park with the pyramid where Konyalalti",
          "being developed right now work, but the locals build very quickly and take pride in their work",
          "You can reach the beach by walking from the Museum Tram station. The beach is so clean and you can enjoy your day by looking over the Mediterranean sea.",
          "Take the old tram if you are on the other side. Then it is a walk down (a did see buses too though). A pebble beach but quite comfortable for a few hours in the sun. Popular with the locals and perfect for a sunny day.",
          "Standing up to my shoulders in the sea, and still be able to see my toes clearly, that means something ;-)",

          "The beauty of this place caused me to make this home. Miles of beaches only a short bus ride away from the Old Town with a plethora of beach bars and a wonderful beach park. There is a miniature city and soon there will be the second largest aquarium in Europe. Swim in the warm",
          "My favourite picture view-point is where the old tourist tram terminates(near the museum).From here you can see the full sweep of this sandy beach with the mountain back-drop",
          "This beach is between my office and my home; during the summer mostly I pass by there to have a swim and relax; I am sure about that you will like it. Also this beach has blue flag",

          "It was beautiful looking at the bay along the walkway to the old town.",
          "I am surprised to find some comments stating that this is \"only a beach\" (yes, if you go to the beach this is what you are expecting to find) and reading disappointment because the beach is made by smooth small rocks instead of sand. I LOVE rocky beaches, it is just a matter of",

          "Turkey is wonderful value, and generally prices are transparent and honest. We\u2019ve been here , now, for 18 days. However, on our second day in Antalya we looked in the harbour for a 2 hour boat trip to the Duden waterfall and back. There were no prices at all displayed on the",
          "Historical area. Full of pseudo galleons offering sea trips - only ONE HOUR!!!! AVOID. The galleons are all different and offer a good photo opportunity.",

          "Extraordinary surrounding flocking with locals & tourists with some beautifully decorated boats / ferrys. Such a mesmerising view and trip in the boat ride for an hour. Lively Cafe's all round. A very well spent evening and night time there.",
          "IT is one of the places must visit when travelled to Antalya. View is beautiful and is one of the tourist attractions. There are many shops around where you can get traditional Turkish delight and all other traditional cultural things. You can also get on a boat trip from the",
          "Very picturesque harbour, worth a few pictures, before the sun sets. Take the lift up and down to better explore the harbour.",
          "Our walk around the harbour was so entertaining. Seeing all the pirate ships and listening to the crews chanting and trying to barter people on board was like being transported back in time. A truly magical place, with lovely little cafes and restaurants.",
          "Had lunch at a restaurant in the marina I wasn\u2019t too impressed it was first restaurant at bottom of the hill leading to the harbour. Food was ok but I\u2019d recommend Vanilla or Du Bastion in Kaleici.",
          "Beautiful views even has a lift that takes u to the bottom. Some amazing boats and little shops. Full of cats and a few restaurants",
          "Just an ood harbour, nothing spectacular about it. Some nice arcitectural buildings and a load of shops easy to haggle with. Nice place to get cheap tat from.",
          "This is old and good place. You can make a trip with boat or you can walk around to big Harbour close to old town of Antalya. Every time good for this place but specially sunsets are amazing",
          "Took a short boat trip round the marina, very pleasant. Sat for awhile with drinks on the waterfront, lovely.",
          "We went from Kalieci street and used an elevator to get to the harbour. You can use the stairs also. There were two some sort of telescopes which by using some coins you are able to see the coast. Then we visited colorful and beautiful boats beside the harbour. Then we get up",
          "The marina area in Antalya is one of the best places in antalya to visit. Not far from nice cafes, shops, restaurants and market. The best thing we did, was taking a boat for about 30 min and the trip was really fantastic and everyone loved it.",
          "This is well worth a visit. Do take the tours they offer in the Marina which will take you to beautiful hidden caves you can't see from the cliff.",
          "Yes while travelling in kaleici streets you walk towards the marina and you come to this beautiful place. Picturesque and experience should be in your antalya take aways",
          "Lots to see and do , full day trips on boats with meals included also drinks available but these are fewer in winter season and as i said previously the water taxis only run on weekend during the winter season but well worth a visit. Also a lift available up to main town",
          "It is very nice to walk around at the harbour in the old town. We came here off season, so there wasnt to many people, which was nice.",
          "I have been there in December to see the winter conditions of heaven Antalya. There were even no signs of winter. There are 2 view points in Marina. First is take the elevator(free) and see the whole marina, second is go to cafes over there to see the amazing view of sun sea and",
          "Well worth the visit. It's a bit up and down so you need young (is) legs. Lots of great places to eat or just have a beer and wat h the world go by.",
          "Really good place to walk around, but the good views are from the higher places in the city. Still you can easily spend 30 mins 1 hour here without noticing it",
          "Top tourist trap with lots of tourist items on sale. Busy narrow streets within Kaleici itself. But interesting and beautiful buildings and a nice atmosphere. Plenty to wonder around and see. Lots of live music, busking, restaurants, alcohol, juice and coffee bars.",
          "Once I arrived in Kaleici, I met friend and he stroll me around this incredible port, it seems small but actually not. I found how locals people live in the boat and fall in love by the way they interacted with tourists. There are so many restaurants around here as well,",
          "This is nice place to spend 1 hour or more just to watch sunset, or in the afternoon for some bites or lunch. There are some restaurant and cafe along the pier but some are in rather expensive price. You can also catch ship for mediterrania sea tour from here.",
          "The harbour is a beautiful little spot at the bottom of the old city. It's a great place for a walk around and admire the impressive historical walls. As always in Turkey plenty of little places for food. When we visited there was a traditional music event happening.",
          "Hot and hazy afternoon with a cold drink in an amazing setting....glorious. Beautiful walks in area...a must see",
          "The place to go to organize your boat trips from Antalya. Tour boats lined up side by side with touts trying to tempt the tourist onto their boat. Several eateries and shops. Peasant spot for a short walk on the waterfront.",

          "Had a lovely brunch there, too early for the Meze though while watching the beach going people at the bottom.",
          "Even though local transporation is clean in Antalya there were some issues: Hard to understand local transportation scheeme if you do not have any app on your mobile (i have used movit; it helped a lot) - in most of the stops there is no info about buses at all, nothing to say",
          "Such a beautiful place just like most of Antalya. It\u2019s even amazing when it\u2019s raining just be careful not to slip",
          "I enjoyed most coming to this place enjoying it from up and then down to the Marina. They had fresh grenadine juice for 3 Lira's only!",
          "Those who like to enjoy the views of the sea from high should go to this place. Then you can take a lift down to the harbour and get into the boat. You can enjoy a one hour tour but you have to count time for the lift queue especially when going back. It takes a long time.",
          "We stumbled on the marina by mistake as we zigged when we should have zagged. There is a cafe and a restaurant overlooking the marina, both of which we didn\u2019t try. There\u2019s also a park nearby. It took us a free look from the stairs leading to the marina and we had great",
          "Antalya\u2019s marine is located in cliff area. The views are awesome specially by sunset. There are many places on the cliffs to get a nice pic of the port.",

          "Its all there eating, sitting down to listen to impromptu singers or guitar players , Ships bobbing in the harbour , fresh fish on you plate and ice cold beer waiting to be drunk whats not to like",
          "As our Hotel was close by we liked to spend evening times at this location. lot of food options and chill vibe is what you will get in evening,in the morning you will find lot of tourists going on day trips from marina. Evening are more claim and wine at one of the places around",

          "What a fascinating place this is.It is a small marina but beautiful with many bars and restaurants around it. A great place to spend some time doing nothing but watch the world go by.",
          "Okay, it\u2019s picturesque and an ancient harbour. But there is literally nothing to do here once the sun goes down. There are boats during the day for sailing tours but their choice of \u2018My heart will go on\u2019 from the Titanic is probably not the best when sailing!",
          "Well worth a vist is you are in the area. The usual pirate boats and pleasure craft which all add to the atmosphere, but its a pretty little harbor. Lined with a few resturants its not overcrowded and well worth a walk around. The thing that impressed me was how clean it was.",
          "We stayed at the Onkel Rada Residence and took cab on our last day to visit this place by cab - the cab journey costs us just over 50 lira, which is about 6.50 UK pounds. In this area it is more of a tourist area and you will find directions very easy. I visited here to shop",
          "This was one of my favourite things to do in Antalya. Pack a beach bag and head to the little cove beach around the corner from the Marina. Tie this in with a walk around old town, and a little gander at Hadrians Gate. Be sure to get a fresh mussel or two from one of the",
          "Get the lift down to the harbour and sit at one of the cafe bars, then take a walk up through the old town around the maze of streets, well worth the trip. You can get the local buses from Lara beach area, Side or Kemer, or just book the trip locally. ,",
          "Beautiful old historic harbour with a vibrant modern upgrade to the surroundings. Relax in lovely local eateries, walk and explore the historic surrounding streets, take in the Yivli (fluted) mosque and see the 650 year old olive tree in its gardens. Plenty of ancient Greek",

          "The harbour area is beautiful with many boats offering trips around the coast line. There are a few nice restaurants offering good food and not too expensive either. Watch out for the steps leading down to the harbour though they are really steep and can be slippery.",
          "Kelechi is the old city area full of shops and restaurants. We went there on a Satuday, it was very busy. This area is quite steep. The harbour is much lower then the main shopping area. It's quite a steep walk especially with pushchairs/strollers. To get back there is a lift",
          "Such a beautiful harbour. Great for an afternoon stroll, very lovely. There are a few restaurants and bars along the harbour serving many fresh caught fish",
          "Nice small harbour surrounded by bars and cafes. All the boat trips go from here with many to choose from. Also you can catch the sea boat to kemer for the day.",
          "This marina is beautiful. Go there on foot from the clock tower to enjoy the surrounding area and do some shopping on the way. There is a lady called warda who sells good quality imitations of famous brands of bags, etc. Bargain a lot before buying however. Once at the marina u",
          "Harbour is mostly tourist boats of two types - large 6hr trips and smaller 1hr circular trips. One firm runs whole place so not much chance for a good deal. Nice views from both sides down into harbour and good shops wandering around the back streets.",
          "A great place to gently walk around during the day or evening. Lively through out the day with its picturesque harbour, restaurants and cafes. Small food stalls offering mussels to freshly cooked fish sandwich. Wonderful relaxing atmosphere, which I preferred than the old city",
          "We manage to reserve one day for getting to know Antalya. We visited the crowded streets in the center and than the commercial areas. In the evening we start to walk along the seaside from the Aquarium area. We noticed that now is a continuous process of modernizing Marina area",
          "The marina is well kept and has beautiful views. There are restaurants and bars as well as souviner shops. We went on a bout trip around Antalya, it was really good and the view were breathtaking. You have to pay for drinks on board. I would reccomend this trip to everyone.",
          "We visited the marina a couple of times. It is full of pirate boats!! We hired a boat privately and went out for the day. We had lunch, swam in the sea and then headed back. We were out for 6hrs. We were scheduled to head for another destination but the sea was choppy so we",

          "One of the best view and amazing walk through the old town of Antalya, looking at the local culture and the shops in the walk way. Remember to negotiate.

          "fantastic place with views to kill for, loverly walk with loads of boats waiting to to take along the coast plus plenty of shops and restaurants.",
          "We were sitting enjoying the views and decided to go for a boat ride. It cost 50 tl for an hour around the area. It was nice in the scorching heat but I think it would have been nicer to do a longer trip and stop at some waterfalls and actually get off th boat.",
          "Good experiance lovely great to get a boat trip from here great to buy souvenirs restaurants and great food",
          "Lovely views all around, great for walking through old town to nearby parks. Lots of boats offering tours but just the walk was breathtaking.. Worth a visit but if you're looking for beach, take a taxi to the konyaalti beach.",

          "On a busy holiday and in Antalya for a few nights, I repaired to this harbour each evening to enjoy the view as the sunset, to watch the waterfall across the harbour, enjoy the ships passing by, laugh at the tourist boats and just chill. Beautiful location.",

          "This is where the amazing Marina is with all it's pirate boats, yaughts and many others. Why don't you go for a party on the boat and have a refreshing drink either on the boat or near by, in one of the beautiful restaurants, customer service is second to none, the staff are all",

        "wiki": "Antalya (Turkish pronunciation: [an\u02c8talja]) is the fifth-most populous city in Turkey and the capital of Antalya Province. Located on Anatolia's southwest coast bordered by the Taurus Mountains, Antalya is the largest Turkish city on the Mediterranean coast outside the Aegean region with over one million people in its metropolitan area.The city that is now Antalya was first settled around 200 BC by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon, which was soon subdued by the Romans. Roman rule saw Antalya thrive, including the construction of several new monuments, such as Hadrian's Gate, and the proliferation of neighboring cities. The city has changed hands several times, including to the Seljuk Sultanate in 1207 and an expanding Ottoman Empire in 1391. Ottoman rule brought relative peace and stability for the next five hundred years. The city was transferred to Italian suzerainty in the aftermath of World War I, but was recaptured by a newly independent Turkey in the War of Independence.\nAntalya is Turkey's biggest international sea resort, located on the Turkish Riviera. Large-scale development and governmental funding has promoted tourism. A record 12.5 million tourists passed through the city in 2014.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city was founded as \"Attaleia\" (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), named after its founder Attalos II, king of Pergamon. This name, still in use in Greek, was later evolved in Turkish as Adalia and then Antalya. Attaleia was also the name of a festival at Delphi and Attalis (Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c2) was the name of an old Greek tribe at Athens.  Despite the close similarity, there is no connection with the name Anatolia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKing Attalus II of Pergamon is looked on as founder of the city in about 150 BC, during the Hellenistic period. It was named Attaleia or Attalia (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) in his honour. The city served as a naval base for Attalus's powerful fleet. Excavations in 2008, in the Do\u011fu Garaj\u0131 plot, uncovered remains dating to the 3rd century BC, suggesting that Attalea was a rebuilding and expansion of an earlier town.\n\nAttalea became part of the Roman Republic in 133 BC when Attalus III, a nephew of Attalus II bequeathed his kingdom to Rome at his death in 133 BC. The city grew and prospered during the Ancient Roman period and was part of the Roman province of Pamphylia Secunda, whose capital was Perga.\nChristianity started to spread to the region even in the 1st century: Antalya was visited by Paul of Tarsus and Barnabas, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: \"Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, and from there they sailed to Antioch\". Some of the bishops attributed to the episcopal see of Attalea in Pamphylia may instead have been bishops of Attalea in Lydia (Yanantepe), since Le Quien lists them under both sees. No longer a residential bishopric, Attalea in Pamphylia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.The 13th-century Seljuk mosque at Attalea, now in ruins, had been a Christian Byzantine basilica from the 7th century. The Great Mosque had also been a Christian basilica and the Kesik Minare Mosque had been the 5th-century Christian Church of the Panaghia or Virgin and was decorated with finely carved marble. The archaeological museum at Attalia houses some sarcophagi and mosaics from nearby Perga and a casket of bones reputed to be those of St. Nicholas, the bishop of Myra, further down the Turquoise coast.\nAntalya was a major city in the Byzantine Empire. It was the capital of the Byzantine Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots, which occupied the southern coasts of Anatolia. According to the research of Speros Vryonis, it was the major naval station on the southern Anatolian coast, a major commercial center, and the most convenient harbor between the Aegean Sea and Cyprus and points further east. Besides the local merchants, \"one could expect to see Armenians, Saracens, Jews, and Italians.\"At the time of the accession of John II Comnenus in 1118 Antalya was an isolated outpost surrounded by Turkish beyliks, accessible only by sea. Following the fall of Constantinople in 1204, Niketas Choniates records that one Aldebrandus, \"an Italian by birth who was strictly raised according to Roman tradition\" controlled Antalya as his own fief. When Kaykhusraw, sultan of the Seljuk Turks attempted to capture the city in 1206, Aldebrandus sent to Cyprus for help and received 200 Latin infantry who defeated the attackers after a siege of less than 16 days. Kaykhusraw would take Antalya the following year and build its first mosque.. People of Christian were rebelled and captured Antalya with aid of Walter of Montb\u00e9liard in 1212. Briefly restored Byzantine rule in Antalya was ended by Kaykaus I in 1216.\n\nThe city and the surrounding region were conquered by the Seljuk Turks in the early 13th century. Antalya was the capital of the Turkish beylik of Teke (1321\u20131423) until its conquest by the Ottomans, except for a period of Cypriot rule between 1361 and 1373. The Arabic traveler Ibn Battuta, who visited the city in 1335\u20131340, noted:\nFrom Alanya I went to Antaliya [Adalia], a most beautiful city. It covers an immense area, and though of vast bulk is one of the most attractive towns to be seen anywhere, besides being exceedingly populous and well laid out. Each section of the inhabitants lives in a separate quarter. The Christian merchants live in a quarter of the town known as the Mina [the Port], and are surrounded by a wall, the gates of which are shut upon them from without at night and during the Friday service. The Greeks, who were its former inhabitants, live by themselves in another quarter, the Jews in another, and the king and his court and Mamluks in another, each of these quarters being walled off likewise. The rest of the Muslims live in the main city. Round the whole town and all the quarters mentioned there is another great wall. The town contains orchards and produces fine fruits, including an admirable kind of apricot, called by them Qamar ad-Din, which has a sweet almond in its kernel. This fruit is dried and exported to Egypt, where it is regarded as a great luxury.\nIn the second half of the 17th century Evliya \u00c7elebi wrote of a city of narrow streets containing 3,000 houses in 20 Turkish and four Greek neighborhoods. The town had grown beyond the city walls and the port was reported to hold up to 200 boats.\nIn the 19th century, in common with most of Anatolia, its sovereign was a \"dere bey\" (landlord or landowner). The family of Tekke O\u011flu, domiciled near Perge had been reduced to submission in 1812 by Mahmud II, but continued to be a rival power to the Ottoman governor until the early 20th century, surviving by many years the fall of the other great beys of Anatolia. The records of the Levant (Turkey) Company, which maintained an agency in Antalya until 1825, documented the local dere beys.In the early 20th century, Antalya had two factories spinning and weaving cotton. As of 1920, the factories had 15,000 spindles and over 200 looms. A German-owned mill baled cotton. There were gin mills.In the 20th century the population of Antalya increased as Turks from the Caucasus and the Balkans moved into Anatolia. The economy was centered on its port that served the inland areas, particularly Konya. Antalya (then Adalia) was picturesque rather than modern. The chief attraction for visitors was the city wall, and outside a promenade, a portion of which survives. The government offices and the houses of the higher classes were outside the walls.\n\nAs of 1920, Antalya was reported as having a population of approximately 30,000. The harbor was described as small, and unsafe for vessels to visit in the winter. Antalya was exporting wheat, flour, sesame seeds, livestock, timber and charcoal. The latter two were often exported to Egypt and other goods to Italy or other Greek islands, who received mainly flour. In 1920, the city had seven flour mills. Wheat was imported, and then processed in town before exportation.

Large-scale development beginning in the 1970s transformed Antalya from a pastoral town into one of Turkey's largest metropolitan areas. Much of this has been due to tourism, which expanded in the 21st century. In the 1985 singing diva Dalida held her last concert in Antalya.\nAntalya was the host city for the 2015 G-20 summit and the EXPO 2016. Five countries have their consular missions in Antalya including Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Belgium and Serbia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area is shielded from the northerly winds by the Taurus Mountains. Antalya has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with hot and dry summers and mild and rainy winters. Around 300 days of the year are sunny, with nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight per year. The mean sea temperature ranges between 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in winter and 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) in summer.

Historical architecture is concentrated in the walled city, Kalei\u00e7i; ancient structures are not well-preserved in the rest of the city of Antalya as the modern city was built on the ancient city. Kalei\u00e7i, with its narrow cobbled streets of historic Ottoman era houses, is the old center of Antalya. With its hotels, bars, clubs, restaurants, and shopping, it has been restored to retain much of its historical character. It is surrounded by two walls in the shape of a horsenail, one of which is along the seafront, built in a continuous process from Hellenistic to Ottoman times. The historical harbour is located in this part of the city; narrow streets extend from the harbour and branch off into the old city, surrounded by wooden historical houses. Cumhuriyet Square, the main square of the city and a spot very popular for tourists and locals, is surrounded by shopping and business centres and public buildings. There are sites with traces of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Seljuk architecture and cultures. There are also examples of the local Greek architecture in the city, with five Greek Orthodox churches in the old city.The walled city is surrounded by a large metropolitan area. With high rates of immigration since the 1970s, this area contains large gecekondu neighborhoods that are not well-integrated into the fabric of the city and suffer from poor economic conditions and insufficient education. Gecekondu areas are concentrated in the Kepez district, where an estimated 70% of the houses were gecekondus in 2008.

Being the capital of the fifth most populous province in Turkey, Antalya is politically strategic and has been a target for the governing center-right Justice and Development Party (AKP). The AKP unexpectedly won control of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality in the 2004 local election. The AKP won a plurality in Antalya in the 2007 general election, symbolising the city's political transformation from a CHP stronghold to a CHP-AKP marginal battleground in the 21st century. The loss of Antalya was a major political setback for the CHP not only because of its significance as a centre for tourism, but also because the CHP's former leader Deniz Baykal is a Member of Parliament for the province. The province is divided into 19 districts.\nThe CHP regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2009 local elections, though the AKP won a plurality in the 2011 general election.

The city voted in favour of the AKP government's proposed constitutional reforms in the 2007 referendum, but voted against the reforms proposed in 2010.\nIn the 2014 local elections, Antalya once again voted for the AKP, with the MHP taking support away from the CHP by winning a record 24.3% of the vote. The CHP subsequently accused the AKP of systematic electoral fraud, and the presence of government minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu at one of the vote counting centres drew strong condemnation. In the 2014 presidential election, the CHP and MHP's joint candidate Ekmeleddin \u0130hsano\u011flu won 53.08% of the vote. The AKP's candidate Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan won 41.63% of the vote, and the HDP democratic socialist candidate Selahattin Demirta\u015f won 5.30% of the vote. Antalya was a hotspot for the 2013\u201314 anti-government protests against the AKP.The secular main opposition, CHP, regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2019 local elections.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe football club of Antalya, Antalyaspor plays in the S\u00fcper Lig.

        "wiki": "Antalya (Turkish pronunciation: [an\u02c8talja]) is the fifth-most populous city in Turkey and the capital of Antalya Province. Located on Anatolia's southwest coast bordered by the Taurus Mountains, Antalya is the largest Turkish city on the Mediterranean coast outside the Aegean region with over one million people in its metropolitan area.The city that is now Antalya was first settled around 200 BC by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon, which was soon subdued by the Romans. Roman rule saw Antalya thrive, including the construction of several new monuments, such as Hadrian's Gate, and the proliferation of neighboring cities. The city has changed hands several times, including to the Seljuk Sultanate in 1207 and an expanding Ottoman Empire in 1391. Ottoman rule brought relative peace and stability for the next five hundred years. The city was transferred to Italian suzerainty in the aftermath of World War I, but was recaptured by a newly independent Turkey in the War of Independence.\nAntalya is Turkey's biggest international sea resort, located on the Turkish Riviera. Large-scale development and governmental funding has promoted tourism. A record 12.5 million tourists passed through the city in 2014.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe city was founded as \"Attaleia\" (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), named after its founder Attalos II, king of Pergamon. This name, still in use in Greek, was later evolved in Turkish as Adalia and then Antalya. Attaleia was also the name of a festival at Delphi and Attalis (Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c2) was the name of an old Greek tribe at Athens.  Despite the close similarity, there is no connection with the name Anatolia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKing Attalus II of Pergamon is looked on as founder of the city in about 150 BC, during the Hellenistic period. It was named Attaleia or Attalia (Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) in his honour. The city served as a naval base for Attalus's powerful fleet. Excavations in 2008, in the Do\u011fu Garaj\u0131 plot, uncovered remains dating to the 3rd century BC, suggesting that Attalea was a rebuilding and expansion of an earlier town.\n\nAttalea became part of the Roman Republic in 133 BC when Attalus III, a nephew of Attalus II bequeathed his kingdom to Rome at his death in 133 BC. The city grew and prospered during the Ancient Roman period and was part of the Roman province of Pamphylia Secunda, whose capital was Perga.\nChristianity started to spread to the region even in the 1st century: Antalya was visited by Paul of Tarsus and Barnabas, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: \"Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, and from there they sailed to Antioch\". Some of the bishops attributed to the episcopal see of Attalea in Pamphylia may instead have been bishops of Attalea in Lydia (Yanantepe), since Le Quien lists them under both sees. No longer a residential bishopric, Attalea in Pamphylia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.The 13th-century Seljuk mosque at Attalea, now in ruins, had been a Christian Byzantine basilica from the 7th century. The Great Mosque had also been a Christian basilica and the Kesik Minare Mosque had been the 5th-century Christian Church of the Panaghia or Virgin and was decorated with finely carved marble. The archaeological museum at Attalia houses some sarcophagi and mosaics from nearby Perga and a casket of bones reputed to be those of St. Nicholas, the bishop of Myra, further down the Turquoise coast.\nAntalya was a major city in the Byzantine Empire. It was the capital of the Byzantine Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots, which occupied the southern coasts of Anatolia. According to the research of Speros Vryonis, it was the major naval station on the southern Anatolian coast, a major commercial center, and the most convenient harbor between the Aegean Sea and Cyprus and points further east. Besides the local merchants, \"one could expect to see Armenians, Saracens, Jews, and Italians.\"At the time of the accession of John II Comnenus in 1118 Antalya was an isolated outpost surrounded by Turkish beyliks, accessible only by sea. Following the fall of Constantinople in 1204, Niketas Choniates records that one Aldebrandus, \"an Italian by birth who was strictly raised according to Roman tradition\" controlled Antalya as his own fief. When Kaykhusraw, sultan of the Seljuk Turks attempted to capture the city in 1206, Aldebrandus sent to Cyprus for help and received 200 Latin infantry who defeated the attackers after a siege of less than 16 days. Kaykhusraw would take Antalya the following year and build its first mosque.. People of Christian were rebelled and captured Antalya with aid of Walter of Montb\u00e9liard in 1212. Briefly restored Byzantine rule in Antalya was ended by Kaykaus I in 1216.\n\nThe city and the surrounding region were conquered by the Seljuk Turks in the early 13th century. Antalya was the capital of the Turkish beylik of Teke (1321\u20131423) until its conquest by the Ottomans, except for a period of Cypriot rule between 1361 and 1373. The Arabic traveler Ibn Battuta, who visited the city in 1335\u20131340, noted:\nFrom Alanya I went to Antaliya [Adalia], a most beautiful city. It covers an immense area, and though of vast bulk is one of the most attractive towns to be seen anywhere, besides being exceedingly populous and well laid out. Each section of the inhabitants lives in a separate quarter. The Christian merchants live in a quarter of the town known as the Mina [the Port], and are surrounded by a wall, the gates of which are shut upon them from without at night and during the Friday service. The Greeks, who were its former inhabitants, live by themselves in another quarter, the Jews in another, and the king and his court and Mamluks in another, each of these quarters being walled off likewise. The rest of the Muslims live in the main city. Round the whole town and all the quarters mentioned there is another great wall. The town contains orchards and produces fine fruits, including an admirable kind of apricot, called by them Qamar ad-Din, which has a sweet almond in its kernel. This fruit is dried and exported to Egypt, where it is regarded as a great luxury.\nIn the second half of the 17th century Evliya \u00c7elebi wrote of a city of narrow streets containing 3,000 houses in 20 Turkish and four Greek neighborhoods. The town had grown beyond the city walls and the port was reported to hold up to 200 boats.\nIn the 19th century, in common with most of Anatolia, its sovereign was a \"dere bey\" (landlord or landowner). The family of Tekke O\u011flu, domiciled near Perge had been reduced to submission in 1812 by Mahmud II, but continued to be a rival power to the Ottoman governor until the early 20th century, surviving by many years the fall of the other great beys of Anatolia. The records of the Levant (Turkey) Company, which maintained an agency in Antalya until 1825, documented the local dere beys.In the early 20th century, Antalya had two factories spinning and weaving cotton. As of 1920, the factories had 15,000 spindles and over 200 looms. A German-owned mill baled cotton. There were gin mills.In the 20th century the population of Antalya increased as Turks from the Caucasus and the Balkans moved into Anatolia. The economy was centered on its port that served the inland areas, particularly Konya. Antalya (then Adalia) was picturesque rather than modern. The chief attraction for visitors was the city wall, and outside a promenade, a portion of which survives. The government offices and the houses of the higher classes were outside the walls.\n\nAs of 1920, Antalya was reported as having a population of approximately 30,000. The harbor was described as small, and unsafe for vessels to visit in the winter. Antalya was exporting wheat, flour, sesame seeds, livestock, timber and charcoal. The latter two were often exported to Egypt and other goods to Italy or other Greek islands, who received mainly flour. In 1920, the city had seven flour mills. Wheat was imported, and then processed in town before exportation. Antalya imported manufactured items, mainly from the United Kingdom.The city had a Greek minority that made up 1/3 of the population until the population exchange.Antalya also had a tiny Armenian population which had a Church on the street of\"Hamam \u00e7ikmazi\"named Hovhannes Surp Garabed,which was later on demolished.Antalya also had a Jewish community which had a tiny Synagogue in the neighborhood of Balbey and a Talmud Tora ,The Synagogue was closed in 1948 and its exact location is not known and the Synagogue might not exist anymore.The Jewish community had 2 graveyards and one was located across \"Donerciler carsisi\"and was demolished when the area was opened to construction ,But one marble tombstone belonging to a Jewish person named Raphael Moshe was transferred to the Antalya Museum where you can see the tombstone in the museums garden.\nThe city was occupied by the Italians from 28 March 1919 to 5 July 1921 during Turkish War of Independence. Large-scale development beginning in the 1970s transformed Antalya from a pastoral town into one of Turkey's largest metropolitan areas. Much of this has been due to tourism, which expanded in the 21st century. In the 1985 singing diva Dalida held her last concert in Antalya.\nAntalya was the host city for the 2015 G-20 summit and the EXPO 2016. Five countries have their consular missions in Antalya including Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Belgium and Serbia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area is shielded from the northerly winds by the Taurus Mountains. Antalya has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) with hot and dry summers and mild and rainy winters. Around 300 days of the year are sunny, with nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight per year. The mean sea temperature ranges between 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in winter and 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) in summer. The highest record air temperature reached 45.4 \u00b0C (113.7 \u00b0F) on 1 July 2017 which normally averages as high as 34.4 \u00b0C (93.9 \u00b0F) and the lowest record dropped to \u22124.6 \u00b0C (23.7 \u00b0F) in February, when the low average is as low as 6.1 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, the Address-Based Birth Recording System showed a metropolitan population of 1,001,318 (502,491 male; 498,827 female). Source for 1530\u20131889\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAgricultural production includes citrus fruits, cotton, cut flowers, olives, olive oil and bananas. Antalya Metropolitan Municipality's covered wholesale food market complex meets 65% of the fresh fruit and vegetable demand of the province.Since 2000, shipyards have been opened in Antalya Free Zone, specialized in building pleasure yachts. Some of these yards have advanced in composites boat building technology.\nCorendon Airlines and SunExpress are headquartered in Antalya.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nDespite having architectural heritage dating back up to Hellenistic times, most historical architecture in Antalya date to the medieval Seljuk period, with a number of mosques, madrasahs, masjids, caravanserais, Turkish baths and tombs giving the city a Turkish-Islamic character. Historical architecture is concentrated in the walled city, Kalei\u00e7i; ancient structures are not well-preserved in the rest of the city of Antalya as the modern city was built on the ancient city. Kalei\u00e7i, with its narrow cobbled streets of historic Ottoman era houses, is the old center of Antalya. With its hotels, bars, clubs, restaurants, and shopping, it has been restored to retain much of its historical character. It is surrounded by two walls in the shape of a horsenail, one of which is along the seafront, built in a continuous process from Hellenistic to Ottoman times. The historical harbour is located in this part of the city; narrow streets extend from the harbour and branch off into the old city, surrounded by wooden historical houses. Cumhuriyet Square, the main square of the city and a spot very popular for tourists and locals, is surrounded by shopping and business centres and public buildings. There are sites with traces of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Seljuk architecture and cultures. There are also examples of the local Greek architecture in the city, with five Greek Orthodox churches in the old city.The walled city is surrounded by a large metropolitan area. With high rates of immigration since the 1970s, this area contains large gecekondu neighborhoods that are not well-integrated into the fabric of the city and suffer from poor economic conditions and insufficient education. Gecekondu areas are concentrated in the Kepez district, where an estimated 70% of the houses were gecekondus in 2008. In 2011, it was estimated that there were 50\u201360,000 gecekondus in Antalya, housing around 250,000 people.Antalya has beaches including Konyaalt\u0131, Lara and Karpuzkald\u0131ran. Beyda\u011flar\u0131 and Saklikent are used for winter sports.\n\n\n=== Historic sites in the city center ===\nAncient monuments include the City Walls, H\u0131d\u0131rl\u0131k Tower, Hadrian's Gate (also known as Triple Gate), and the Clock Tower.\nHadrian's Gate: constructed in the 2nd century by the Romans in honor of the Emperor Hadrian.\n\u0130skele Mosque: A 19th-century Mosque near the marina.\nKaratay Medrese: A Medrese (Islamic theological seminary) built in 1250 by Emir Celaleddin Karatay.\nKesik Minare (Broken Minaret) Mosque: Once a Roman temple then converted to a Byzantine Panayia church and finally into a mosque.\nTekeli Mehmet Pa\u015fa Mosque: An 18th-century Mosque built in honor of Tekeli Mehmet Pa\u015fa.\nYat Liman\u0131: the harbour dating to Roman era.\nYivli Minare (Fluted Minaret) Mosque: Built by the Seljuks and decorated with dark blue and turquoise tiles. This minaret eventually became the symbol of the city.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\n\n\n=== Green areas, recreation places ===\n\nThere are urban parks and protected natural areas located outside the cities, allowing the people to have fun, rest and get closer to nature.

The shopping centers in the city are gathered in the center. Among the leading shopping centers in the city are Antalya 5M Migros, Antalya Kipa, Laura, Shemall, Deepo and \u00d6zdilekpark.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe mayor of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality is Muhittin B\u00f6cek of the CHP, in office since 2019. For general elections, Antalya elects 18 Members of Parliament to the Turkish Grand National Assembly.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\nAntalya has traditionally been seen as a stronghold for the Kemalist centre-left party Republican People's Party (CHP). Being the capital of the fifth most populous province in Turkey, Antalya is politically strategic and has been a target for the governing center-right Justice and Development Party (AKP). The AKP unexpectedly won control of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality in the 2004 local election. The AKP won a plurality in Antalya in the 2007 general election, symbolising the city's political transformation from a CHP stronghold to a CHP-AKP marginal battleground in the 21st century. The loss of Antalya was a major political setback for the CHP not only because of its significance as a centre for tourism, but also because the CHP's former leader Deniz Baykal is a Member of Parliament for the province. The province is divided into 19 districts.\nThe CHP regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2009 local elections, though the AKP won a plurality in the 2011 general election. The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) also have a strong political base in Antalya, winning approximately between 15 and 25% of the vote in elections since 2007. The city voted in favour of the AKP government's proposed constitutional reforms in the 2007 referendum, but voted against the reforms proposed in 2010.\nIn the 2014 local elections, Antalya once again voted for the AKP, with the MHP taking support away from the CHP by winning a record 24.3% of the vote. The CHP subsequently accused the AKP of systematic electoral fraud, and the presence of government minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu at one of the vote counting centres drew strong condemnation. In the 2014 presidential election, the CHP and MHP's joint candidate Ekmeleddin \u0130hsano\u011flu won 53.08% of the vote. The AKP's candidate Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan won 41.63% of the vote, and the HDP democratic socialist candidate Selahattin Demirta\u015f won 5.30% of the vote. Antalya was a hotspot for the 2013\u201314 anti-government protests against the AKP.The secular main opposition, CHP, regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the 2019 local elections.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe football club of Antalya, Antalyaspor plays in the S\u00fcper Lig. The team's home venue is Antalya Arena, with a capacity of 33,000, which was opened in 2015.

Since 2006, one of the four stages of Archery World Cup events are held at the Antalya Centennial Archery Field. It also hosted European Weightlifting Championship in 2012, European Beach Volleyball Championship in 2003, European Triathlon Championship in 2013 and World Kickboxing Championships in 2013.\nSince 2010, an international multiday trail running ultramarathon, called Lycian Way Ultramarathon, is held on the historical Lycian Way. The event runs eastward on a route of around 220\u2013240 km (140\u2013150 mi) from \u00d6l\u00fcdeniz in Fethiye district of Mu\u011fla Province to Antalya in six days.\n\n\n== Education ==\nAkdeniz University enrolls over 60,000 students.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nAntalya's signature cuisine includes Piyaz (made with tahini, garlic, walnuts, and boiled beans), \u015fi\u015f k\u00f6fte (spicy meatball which is cooked around a stick) spicy hibe\u015f with mixed cumin and tahini, tand\u0131r kebap, domates civesi, \u015fak\u015fuka, and various cold Mediterranean dishes with olive oil.

In 2010, the city planned to increase from 40 to 140 more buses.Payment for public transportation was made in cash until the launch of a public transportation card, Antkart, in late 2007. The card system met with criticism and was subsequently canceled in June 2009, returning to a cash system. Halkkart has been used for the transportation system since the summer of 2010.

          "Great for kids but very small place.  You only need 2 hours max",
          "The weather was very hot as reason of high humidity.\nThe place is very nice for 4-6 years kids especially for taking pictures.\nThe price is kind of high for 6+ it is 25$ approximately 145 tl.\nThe 7d cenima was nice and it has air conditioner",
          "Good time spending for the large family with kids. Large swimming pools large territory, zip line, good Cafe. Everything included in price 25 usd. 7d cinema is very outdated.",
          "Great place to spend brilliant time with family.",
          "Tickets adults $25, My son was 3 years no charge free entrance. Over all my son loved it. The 7d cinema was closed on April 29",
          "Fantastic day out with the kids. As close to Jurassic park as you're gonna get in Europe",
          "A rip off from another planet. USD 25 per adult for rubber dinos. The kids soon realize its fake. The entry fee is too high for what you get. Nothing special ...",
          "Very interesting place! I recommend!!",
          "ilk sefer i\u00e7in s\u00fcper ,2. sefer? ehh \n\nfor the first time ,great place to visit..\n2. time... ? come on go and find another place",

          "had big thoughts about this place but it was not as i thought. \nthe breakfast was not as on the pictures you got a plate with some cheese and meat and the service was somewhat slow. it was also not as big as i thought when its advertising \u2026",
          "Nice place for kids, entrance fee is rather expensive, needs more attention to the zoo cleanliness and also needs more activities. Kids liked dinosaurs, pony ride, trampolines and xd cinema show.",
          "Dino Park is small. 1 - 1.5h is enough to walk around it two times. From my opinion it is not worth its price.",
          "The place is interesting but not worth the.ticket price. It was 25 USD and they added the 7D Cinema and Fear room for free. 7D cinema is pkay only and the park in general is good. Worth a look around for about an hour but all the rubber made items doesn't worth 25$.\nThere is two pools, so do take your swim suits.",

          "They ask the tourist to pay in $ and for Turkish people in TL, for Turkish 35 or 38 TL for others $25",
          "Fun for children but much too expensive (100 USD for 2 children and 2 adults is almost half the price you pay for The Land of Legends and you can hardly compare the amount of activities).",

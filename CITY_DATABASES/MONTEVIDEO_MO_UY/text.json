        "wiki": "Montevideo (Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u03b2i\u02c8\u00f0eo]) is the capital and largest city of Uruguay. According to the 2011 census, the city proper has a population of 1,319,108 (about one-third of the country's total population) in an area of 201 square kilometres (78 sq mi). The southernmost capital city in the Americas, Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the R\u00edo de la Plata.\nThe city was established in 1724 by a Spanish soldier, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, as a strategic move amidst the Spanish-Portuguese dispute over the platine region. It was also under brief British rule in 1807. Montevideo is the seat of the administrative headquarters of Mercosur and ALADI, Latin America's leading trade blocs, a position that entailed comparisons to the role of Brussels in Europe.The 2019 Mercer's report on quality of life, rated Montevideo first in Latin America, a rank the city has consistently held since 2005. As of 2010, Montevideo was the 19th largest city economy in the continent and 9th highest income earner among major cities. In 2020, it has a projected GDP of $49.7 billion, with a per capita of $28,385.In 2018, it was classified as a beta global city ranking eighth in Latin America and 84th in the world. Montevideo hosted every match during the first FIFA World Cup, in 1930. Described as a \"vibrant, eclectic place with a rich cultural life\", and \"a thriving tech center and entrepreneurial culture\", Montevideo ranked eighth in Latin America on the 2013 MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.In 2014, it was also regarded as the fifth most gay-friendly metropolis in the world and the first in Latin America. It is the hub of commerce and higher education in Uruguay as well as its chief port. The city is also the financial hub of Uruguay and the cultural anchor of a metropolitan area with a population of around 2 million.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are several explanations about the word Montevideo. All agree that \"Monte\" refers to the Cerro de Montevideo, the hill situated across the Bay of Montevideo, but there is disagreement about the etymological origin of the \"video\" part.\n\nMonte vide eu (\"I saw a mount\") is the most widespread belief but is rejected by the majority of experts, who consider it unlikely because it involves a mix of dialects. The name would come from a Portuguese expression which means \"I saw a mount\", wrongly pronounced by an anonymous sailor belonging to the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes on catching sight of the Cerro de Montevideo.\nMonte Vidi: This hypothesis comes from the \"Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n\" (Navigational Calendar) of boatswain Francisco de Albo, member of the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes, who wrote, \"Tuesday of the said [month of January 1520] we were on the straits of Cape Santa Mar\u00eda [now Punta del Este], from where the coast runs east to west, and the terrain is sandy, and at the right of the cape there is a mountain like a hat to which we gave the name \"Montevidi\".\" This is the oldest Spanish document that mentions the promontory with a name similar to the one that designates the city, but it does not contain any mention of the alleged cry \"Monte vide eu.\"\nMonte-VI-D-E-O (Monte VI De Este a Oeste): According to Rolando Laguarda Tr\u00edas, professor of history, the Spaniards annotated the geographic location on a map or Portolan chart, so that the mount/hill is the VI (6th) mount observable on the coast, navigating R\u00edo de la Plata from east to west. With the passing of time, these words were unified to \"Montevideo\". No conclusive evidence has been found to confirm this academic hypothesis nor can it be asserted with certainty which were the other five mounts observable before the Cerro.\nMonte Ovidio (Monte Santo Ovidio), a less widespread hypothesis of a religious origin, stems from an interpolation in the aforementioned Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n of Fernando de Albo, where it is asserted \"corruptly now called Santo Vidio\" when they refer to the hat-like mount which they named Monte Vidi (that is, the Cerro de Montevideo). Ovidio (Saint Ovidius) was the third bishop of the Portuguese city of Braga, where he was always revered; a monument to him was erected there in 1505. Given the relationship that the Portuguese had with the discovery and foundation of Montevideo, and despite the fact that this hypothesis, like the previous ones, lacks conclusive documentation, there have been those who linked the name of Santo Ovidio or Vidio (appearing on some maps of the time) with the subsequent derivation of the name \"Montevideo\" given to the region since the early years of the 16th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBetween 1680 and 1683, Portugal founded the city of Colonia do Sacramento in the region across the bay from Buenos Aires. This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca of Portugal built the Montevieu fort.\nA Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were known as Guanches or Canarians. There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name of Jorge Burgues.A census of the city's inhabitants was performed in 1724 and then a plan was drawn delineating the city and designating it as San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo, later shortened to Montevideo. The census counted fifty families of Galician and Canary Islands origin, more than 1000 indigenous people, mostly Guaran\u00ed, as well as Black African slaves of Bantu origin.A few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the R\u00edo de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River, competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata brought it in confrontations with the city of Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was taken over to be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.\nIn 1776, Spain made Montevideo its main naval base (Real Apostadero de Marina) for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, Fernando Po, and the Falklands.Until the end of the 18th century, Montevideo remained a fortified area, today known as Ciudad Vieja.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nOn 3 February 1807, British troops under the command of General Samuel Auchmuty and Admiral Charles Stirling occupied the city during the Battle of Montevideo (1807), but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the same year on 2 September when John Whitelocke was forced to surrender to troops formed by forces of the Banda Oriental\u2014roughly the same area as modern Uruguay\u2014and of Buenos Aires. After this conflict, the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de El\u00edo opposed the new viceroy Santiago de Liniers, and created a government Junta when the Peninsular War started in Spain, in defiance of Liniers. El\u00edo disestablished the Junta when Liniers was replaced by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros.\nDuring the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo. During that year and the next, Uruguayan revolutionary Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain. In 1811, the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo, which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution. The siege was lifted at the end of that year, when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region.The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814. In 1816, Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821, it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil. It was named Imperial City by Emperor Pedro I when the city was part of the Empire of Brazil as capital of the Cisplatina province. Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the Treinta y Tres Orientales (\"Thirty-Three Orientals\") re-established the independence of the region in 1825. Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828, with Montevideo as the nation's capital. In 1829, the demolition of the city's fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja, referred to as the \"Ciudad Nueva\" (\"new city\"). Urban expansion, however, moved very slowly because of the events that followed.\n\nUruguay's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between Manuel Oribe and Fructuoso Rivera, the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the Empire of Brazil under the command of Lavalleja, each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction. Politics were divided between Oribe's Blancos (\"whites\"), represented by the National Party, and Rivera's Colorados (\"reds\"), represented by the Colorado Party, with each party's name taken from the colour of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the Guerra Grande, which lasted until 1851.\nThe city of Montevideo suffered a siege of eight years between 1843 and 1851, during which it was supplied by sea with British and French support. Oribe, with the support of the then conservative Governor of Buenos Aires Province Juan Manuel de Rosas, besieged the Colorados in Montevideo, where the latter were supported by the French Legion, the Italian Legion, the Basque Legion and battalions from Brazil. Finally, in 1851, with the additional support of Argentine rebels who opposed Rosas, the Colorados defeated Oribe. The fighting, however, resumed in 1855, when the Blancos came to power, which they maintained until 1865. Thereafter, the Colorado Party regained power, which they retained until past the middle of the 20th century.\nAfter the end of hostilities, a period of growth and expansion started for the city. In 1853 a stagecoach bus line was established joining Montevideo with the newly formed settlement of Uni\u00f3n and the first natural gas street lights were inaugurated. From 1854 to 1861 the first public sanitation facilities were constructed. In 1856 the Teatro Sol\u00eds was inaugurated, 15 years after the beginning of its construction. By Decree, in December 1861 the areas of Aguada and Cord\u00f3n were incorporated to the growing Ciudad Nueva (New City). In 1866, an underwater telegraph line connected the city with Buenos Aires. The statue of Peace, La Paz, was erected on a column in Plaza Cagancha and the building of the Postal Service as well as the bridge of Paso Molino were inaugurated in 1867.In 1868, the horse-drawn tram company Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tranv\u00edas al Paso del Molino y Cerro created the first lines connecting Montevideo with Uni\u00f3n, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro, at the time called Cosmopolis. In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras. During the same year and the next, the neighbourhoods Col\u00f3n, Nuevo Par\u00eds and La Comercial were founded. The Sunday market of Trist\u00e1n Narvaja Street was established in Cord\u00f3n in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, Bulevar Circunvalaci\u00f3n was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas, going up to the north end of the city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed to Artigas Boulevard (its current name) in 1885. By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area Los Pocitos was incorporated to the Nov\u00edsima Ciudad (Most New City).The first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas operated ones in 1886. The Hip\u00f3dromo de Maro\u00f1as started operating in 1888, and the neighbourhoods of Reus del Sur, Reus del Norte and Conciliaci\u00f3n were inaugurated in 1889. The new building of the School of Arts and Trades, as well as Zabala Square in Ciudad Vieja were inaugurated in 1890, followed by the Italian Hospital in 1891. In the same year, the village of Pe\u00f1arol was founded. Other neighbourhoods that were founded were Belgrano and Belvedere in 1892, Jacinto Vera in 1895 and Trouville in 1897. In 1894 the new port was constructed, and in 1897, the Central Railway Station of Montevideo was inaugurated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, many Europeans (particularly Spaniards and Italians but also thousands from Central Europe) immigrated to the city. In 1908, 30% of the city's population of 300,000 was foreign-born. In that decade the city expanded quickly: new neighbourhoods were created and many separate settlements were annexed to the city, among which were the Villa del Cerro, Pocitos, the Prado and Villa Col\u00f3n. The Rod\u00f3 Park and the Estadio Gran Parque Central were also established, which served as poles of urban development.During the early 20th century, Uruguay saw huge social changes with repercussions primarily in urban areas. Among these changes were the right of divorce (1907) and women's right to vote.The 1910s saw the construction of Montevideo's Rambla; strikes by tram workers, bakers and port workers; the inauguration of electric trams; the creation of the Municipal Intendencias; and the inauguration of the new port.In 1913, the city limits were extended around the entire gulf. The previously independent localities of the Villa del Cerro and La Teja were annexed to Montevideo, becoming two of its neighborhoods.During the 1920s, the equestrian statue of Artigas was installed in Plaza Independencia; the Palacio Legislativo was built; the Spanish Plus Ultra flying boat arrived (the first airplane to fly from Spain to Latin America, 1926); prominent politician and former president Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez died (1929); and ground was broken (1929) for the Estadio Centenario (completed 1930).During World War II, a famous incident involving the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee took place in Punta del Este, 200 kilometers (120 mi) from Montevideo. After the Battle of the River Plate with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy on 13 December 1939, the Graf Spee retreated to Montevideo's port, which was considered neutral at the time. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on 17 December. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. The eagle figurehead of the Graf Spee was salvaged on 10 February 2006; to protect the feelings of those still sensitive to Nazi Germany, the swastika on the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water.\n\nUruguay began to stagnate economically in the mid-1950s; Montevideo began a decline, later exacerbated by widespread social and political violence beginning in 1968 (including the emergence of the guerrilla Movimiento de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional-Tupamaros) and by the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985). There were major problems with supply; the immigration cycle was reversed.\nFrom the 1960s to the end of the dictatorship in 1985, around one hundred people died or disappeared because of the political violence. From 1974 another hundred Uruguayans disappeared also in Argentina. In 1980, the dictatorship proposed a new constitution. The project was submitted to referendum and rejected in the first polls since 1971, with 58% of the votes against and 42% in favour. The result weakened the military and triggered its fall, allowing the return of democracy.In the 1980s, Pope John Paul II visited the city twice. In April 1987, as head of state of Vatican, he signed a mediation agreement for the conflict of the Beagle Channel. He also held a large mass in Tres Cruces, declaring the cross located behind the altar as a monument. In 1988, he returned to the country, visiting Montevideo, Florida, Salto and Melo.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe 2002 Uruguay banking crisis affected several industries of Montevideo. In 2017, the city has maintained 15 years of economic growth, with a GDP of $44 billion, and a GDP per capita of $25,900.Montevideo has consistently been rated as having the highest quality of life of any city in Latin America: by 2015 it held this rank every year during the decade through 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMontevideo is situated on the north shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata, the arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the south coast of Uruguay from the north coast of Argentina; Buenos Aires lies 230 kilometres (140 mi) west on the Argentine side. The Santa Luc\u00eda River forms a natural border between Montevideo and San Jos\u00e9 Department to its west. To the city's north and east is Canelones Department, with the stream of Carrasco forming the eastern natural border. The coastline forming the city's southern border is interspersed with rocky protrusions and sandy beaches. The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbour, the nation's largest and one of the largest in the Southern Cone, and the finest natural port in the region, functioning as a crucial component of the Uruguayan economy and foreign trade. Various streams criss-cross the town and empty into the Bay of Montevideo. Its coastline near the emptying rivers are heavily polluted.The city has an average elevation of 43 metres (141 ft). Its highest elevations are two hills: the Cerro de Montevideo and the Cerro de la Victoria, with the highest point, the peak of Cerro de Montevideo, crowned by a fortress, the Fortaleza del Cerro at a height of 134 m (440 ft). Closest cities by road are Las Piedras to the north and the so-called Ciudad de la Costa (a conglomeration of coastal towns) to the east, both in the range of 20 to 25 km (16 mi) from the city center. The approximate distances to the neighbouring department capitals by road are, 90 km (56 mi) to San Jose de Mayo (San Jose Department) and 46 km (29 mi) to Canelones (Canelones Department).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontevideo enjoys a humid subtropical climate (Cfa, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). The city has mild winters (June to September), warm-hot summers (December to March) and volatile springs (October and November); there are numerous thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout the year, reaching around 950 millimetres (37 in).Winters are generally cool, wet, windy and overcast. During this season, there are bursts of icy and relatively dry winds of continental polar air masses, giving an unpleasant chilly feeling to the everyday life of the city. Frosts occur few times during winter, generally not falling below 28\u00b0 F (-2\u00b0 C) because of the oceanic influence that moderates the temperature; few miles away from the coast, frosts are more common and colder. Rainfall and sleet are a frequent winter occurrence, but snowfall is extremely rare: flurries have been recorded only four times but with no accumulation, the last one on 13 July 1930 during the inaugural match of the World Cup, (the other three snowfalls were in 1850, 1853 and 1917); the alleged 1980 Carrasco snowfall was actually a hailstorm.Summers are warm-hot and humid, with less wind than other seasons. During this season, a moderate wind often blows from the sea in the evenings which has a pleasant cooling effect on the city, in contrast to the more-severe summer heat of nearby cities like Buenos Aires. Heat waves come with the north winds, which bring humid and hot air masses from the tropical interior of the continent. These warm periods are usually followed by thunderstorms, generated by cold fronts of the southwest that lowers temperatures considerably. This phenomenon is regional, and can occur several times all year long.\nMontevideo has an annual average temperature of 16.7 \u00b0C (62.1 \u00b0F). The lowest recorded temperature is \u22125.6 \u00b0C (21.9 \u00b0F) while the highest is 42.8 \u00b0C (109.0 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions and barrios ===\n\nAs of 2010, the city of Montevideo has been divided into 8 political municipalities (Municipios), referred to with the letters from A to G, including CH, each presided over by a mayor elected by the citizens registered in the constituency. This division, according to the Municipality of Montevideo, \"aims to advance political and administrative decentralization in the department of Montevideo, with the aim of deepening the democratic participation of citizens in governance.\" The head of each Municipio is called an alcalde or (if female) alcaldesa.Of much greater importance is the division of the city into 62 barrios: neighbourhoods or wards. Many of the city's barrios\u2014such as Sayago, Ituzaing\u00f3 and Pocitos\u2014were previously geographically separate settlements, later absorbed by the growth of the city. Others grew up around certain industrial sites, including the salt-curing works of Villa del Cerro and the tanneries in Nuevo Par\u00eds. Each barrio has its own identity, geographic location and socio-cultural activities. A neighbourhood of great significance is Ciudad Vieja, that was surrounded by a protective wall until 1829. This area contains most important buildings of the colonial era and early decades of independence.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n\nThe architecture of Montevideo ranges from Neoclassical buildings such as the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral to the Postmodern style of the World Trade Center Montevideo or the 158-metre (518 ft) ANTEL Telecommunication Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the country. The Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the Palacio Salvo dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building facades in the Old Town reflect the city's extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the Legislative Palace, the City Hall, Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower. The most notable sports stadium is the Estadio Centenario within Parque Batlle. Parque Batlle, Parque Rod\u00f3 and Parque Prado are Montevideo's three great parks.The Pocitos district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the \"Edificio Panamericano\" designed by Raul Sichero, and the \"Positano\" and \"El Pilar\" designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis Garc\u00eda Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighbourhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle class residents.\n\n\n==== Palacio Legislativo ====\n\nThe Palacio Legislativo in Aguada, the north of the city centre, is currently the seat of the Uruguayan Parliament. Construction started in 1904 and was sponsored by the government of President Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. It was designed by Italian architects Vittorio Meano and Gaetano Moretti, who planned the building's interior. Among the notable contributors to the project was sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni, who contributed numerous reliefs and allegorical sculptures.\n\n\n==== World Trade Center Montevideo ====\n\nWorld Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998, but work was completed in 2009. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998. It has 22 floors and 17,100 square metres of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and 27,000 square metres (290,000 sq ft) of space. The 6,300-square-metre (68,000 sq ft) World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a centre of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St. Among the establishments on the plaza are Burger King, Walrus, Bamboo, Asia de Cuba, Gardenia Mvd, and La Claraboya Cafe.\nThe Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social place. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor Pablo Atchugarry. World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and 53,500 square metres (576,000 sq ft) of space is under construction as of 2010.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications Tower ====\n\nTorre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the 158 metres (518 ft), 37-floor headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company, ANTEL, and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect Carlos Ott. It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by American Bridge and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.\nWhen its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40 million, plus US$25 million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65 million price into US$102 million.\n\n\n==== Ciudad Vieja (Old City) ====\n\nCiudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent barrio of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and night-clubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.\n\nMontevideo's most important plaza is Plaza Independencia, located between Ciudad Vieja and downtown Montevideo. It starts with the Gateway of The Citadel at one end and ends at the beginning of 18 de Julio Avenue. It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city. Several notable buildings are located here.  The Sol\u00eds Theatre is Uruguay's oldest theatre. It was built in 1856 and is currently owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theatre, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by Philippe Starck. The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theatre reopened in August of that year. The plaza is also the site of the offices of the President of Uruguay (both the Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower). The Artigas Mausoleum is located at the centre of the plaza. Statues include that of Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, hero of Uruguay's independence movement; an honour guard keeps vigil at the Mausoleum.Palacio Salvo, at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands 100 metres (330 ft) high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confiter\u00eda La Giralda, renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez wrote his tango \"La Cumparsita\" (1917.) Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.Also of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (or Plaza Matriz). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the Cabildo\u2014the seat of colonial government\u2014and the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral. The cathedral is the burial place of Fructuoso Rivera, Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Venancio Flores. Another notable square is Plaza Zabala with the equestrian statue of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On its south side, Palacio Taranco, once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto, another major tourist destination.\n\n\n==== Parque Batlle ====\n\nParque Batlle (formerly: Parque de los Aliados, translation: \"Park of the Allies\") is a major public central park, located south of Avenida Italia and north of Avenue Rivera. Along with Parque Prado and Parque Rod\u00f3 it is one of three large parks that dominate Montevideo. The park and surrounding area constitute one of the 62 neighbourhoods (barrios) of the city. The barrio of Parque Batlle is one of seven coastal barrios, the others being Buceo, Carrasco, Malvin, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, and Punta Gorda. The current barrio of Parque Battle includes four former districts: Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and Batlle Park itself and borders the neighbourhoods of La Blanqueada, Tres Cruces, Pocitos and Buceo. It has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income. Villa Dolores, a subdistrict of Parque Batlle, took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Do\u00f1a Dolores Pereira de Rossel. On their grounds, they started a private collection of animals that became a zoological garden and was passed to the city in 1919; in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises.\n\nParque Batlle is named in honour of Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915. The park was originally proposed by an Act of March 1907, which also projected wide boulevards and avenues. French landscape architect, Carlos Thays, began the plantings in 1911. In 1918, the park was named Parque de los Aliados, following the victory of the Allies of World War I. On 5 May 1930, after significant expansion, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, in memory of the prominent politician and president, who had died in 1929. The park was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975. As of 2010, the park covers an area of 60 hectares (150 acres) and is considered the \"lung\" of the Montevideo city due to the large variety of trees planted here.The Estadio Centenario, the national football stadium, opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, and later hosted several other sporting grounds of note (see Sports).\nIn 1934, sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni's \"La Carreta\", a bronze monument on granite base, was installed on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario. One of several statues in the park, it depicts yoked oxen pulling a loaded wagon. It was designated a national monument in 1976. Another statue on the same side of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron.\nOn the west side of Parque Batlle, on Artigas Boulevard, the 1938 Obelisk of Montevideo is a monument dedicated to those who created the first Constitution. The work of sculptor Jos\u00e9 Luis Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn (1891\u20131975), it is a three-sided granite obelisk, 40 metres (130 ft) tall, with bronze statues on its three sides, representing \"Law\", \"Liberty\", and \"Force\", respectively. It has been a National Heritage Site since 1976.\n\n\n==== Parque Prado ====\n\nEstablished in 1873, the largest of Montevideo's six main public parks is the 1.06-square-kilometre (260-acre) Parque Prado. Located in the northern part of the city, the Miguelete Creek flows through the park and the neighbourhood and of the same name. It is surrounded by the avenues Agraciada, Obes Lucas, Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez, Luis Alberto de Herrera and by the streets Castro and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyes.\nThe most frequented areas of the park are the Rosedal, a public rose garden with pergolas, the Botanical Garden, the area around the Hotel del Prado, as well as the Rural del Prado, a seasonal cattle and farm animal fairground. The Rosedal contains four pergolas, eight domes, and a fountain; its 12,000 roses were imported from France in 1910. There are several jogging paths along the Miguelete river.\nThe Presidential Residence is located behind the Botanical Gardens. Established in 1930, Juan Manuel Blanes Museum is situated in the Palladian villa, a National Heritage Site since 1975, and includes a Japanese garden. The Professor Atilio Lombardo Museum and Botanical Gardens were established in 1902. The National Institute of Physical Climatology and its observatory are also in the Prado.\n\n\n==== Parque Rod\u00f3 ====\n\nParque Rod\u00f3 is both a barrio (neighbourhood) of Montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighbourhood itself and belongs to Punta Carretas. The name \"Rod\u00f3\" commemorates Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, an important Uruguayan writer whose monument is in the southern side of the main park. The park was conceived as a French-style city park. Apart from the main park area which is delimited by Sarmiento Avenue to the south, Parque Rod\u00f3 includes an amusement park; the Estadio Luis Franzini, belonging to Defensor Sporting; the front lawn of the Faculty of Engineering and a strip west of the Club de Golf de Punta Carretas that includes the Canteras (\"quarry\") del Parque Rod\u00f3, the Teatro de Verano (\"summer theatre\") and the Lago (\"lake\") del Parque Rod\u00f3.On the east side of the main park area is the National Museum of Visual Arts. On this side, a street market takes place every Sunday. On the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children. An area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography. West of the park, across the coastal avenue Rambla Presidente Wilson, stretches Ramirez Beach. Directly west of the main park are, and belonging to Parque Rod\u00f3 barrio, is the former Parque Hotel, now called Edif\u00edcio Mercosur, seat of the parliament of the members countries of the Mercosur. During the guerilla war the Tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area, including the old hotel.\n\n\n==== Forts ====\nThe first set of subsidiary forts were planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at Colonia del Sacramento. However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship Nossa Senhora de Oliveara. They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.\n\n\n===== Fortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro) =====\n\nFortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839. It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931 and has housed a military museum since 1916. Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.\n\n\n==== Punta Brava Lighthouse ====\n\nPunta Brava Lighthouse (Faro Punta Brava), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876. The lighthouse is 21 metres (69 ft) high and its light reaches 24 km (15 mi) away, with a flash every ten seconds. In 1962, the lighthouse became electric. The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Ingl\u00e9s Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Luc\u00eda River.\n\n\n==== Rambla of Montevideo ====\n\nThe Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word rambla is \"avenue\" or \"watercourse\", but in the Americas it is mostly used as \"coastal avenue\", and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the R\u00edo de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas (\"United Nations\"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.\n\nThe Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even\u2014in a special area\u2014skateboard. Its 27-kilometre (17 mi) length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.Montevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city. Its best known beaches are Ram\u00edrez, Pocitos, Carrasco, Buceo and Malv\u00edn. Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.\n\n\n==== Cemeteries ====\n\nThere are five large cemeteries in Montevideo, all administered by the \"F\u00fanebre y Necr\u00f3polis\" annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Juan Manuel Blanes, Fran\u00e7ois Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont (Isidore Ducasse), Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, and Juan Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn.\nThe other large cemeteries are the Cementerio del Buceo, Cementerio del Cerro, and Cementerio Paso Molino.\nThe British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Brit\u00e1nico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighborhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Mr. Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors, contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine, Henry de Costa, is buried here.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nIn 1860, Montevideo had 57,913 inhabitants including a number of people of African origin who had been brought as slaves and had gained their freedom around the middle of the century. By 1880, the population had quadrupled, mainly because of the great European immigration. In 1908, its population had grown massively to 309,331 inhabitants. In the course of the 20th century the city continued to receive large numbers of European immigrants, especially Spanish and Italian, followed by French, Germans, English, Irish, Swiss, Austrians, Poles, Dutch, Greek, Hungarians, Russians, Croats, Lebanese, Armenians, and Jews of various origins. The last wave of immigrants occurred between 1945 and 1955.According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay's total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of \u22121.5 per thousand. Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975\u20131985, which showed a rate of \u22125.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004. However, mortality continued to fall with life expectancy at birth for both sexes increasing by 1.73 years.In the census of 2011, Montevideo had a population of 1,319,108.\nSource: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica de Uruguay\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Intendencia de Montevideo ===\n\nThe Municipality of Montevideo was first created by a legal act of 18 December 1908. The municipality's first mayor (1909\u20131911) was Daniel Mu\u00f1oz. Municipalities were abolished by the Uruguayan Constitution of 1918, effectively restored during the 1933 military coup of Gabriel Terra, and formally restored by the 1934 Constitution. The 1952 Constitution again decided to abolish the municipalities; it came into effect in February 1955. Municipalities were replaced by departmental councils, which consisted of a collegiate executive board with 7 members from Montevideo and 5 from the interior region. However, municipalities were revived under the 1967 Constitution and have operated continuously since that time.\nSince 1990, Montevideo has been partially decentralized into 18 areas; administration and services for each area is provided by its Zonal Community Center (Centro Comunal Zonal, CCZ), which is subordinate to the Municipality of Montevideo. The boundaries of the municipal districts of Montevideo were created on 12 July 1993, and successively amended on 19 October 1993, 6 June 1994 and 10 November 1994.\nThe city government of Montevideo performs several functions, including maintaining communications with the public, promoting culture, organizing society, caring for the environment and regulating traffic. Its headquarters is the Palacio Municipal on 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro area of Montevideo.Another body, the Junta Departamental, or the Congress of Montevideo, governs the Department of Montevideo. The Junta, composed of 31 unsalaried elected members, is responsible for such things as the freedom of the citizens, the regulation of cultural activities, the naming of streets and public places, and the placement of monuments; it also responds to proposals of the Intendant in various circumstances. Its seat is the architecturally remarkable Casa de Francisco G\u00f3mez in Ciudad Vieja.A 2016 private ranking named Subnational Legislative Online Opening Index measured the data availability in official websites, scoring Montevideo as the second most open district nationally at 17.50 points.\n\n\n=== Intendants of Montevideo ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn recent years Montevideo nightlife has moved to Parque Rod\u00f3, where a large concentration of buildings cater for the recreational interests of young people during the night time. Under a presidential decree of 1 March 2006 smoking is prohibited in any public place with roofing, and there is a prohibition on the sale of alcohol in certain businesses from 21.00 to 9.00.Montevideo has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Literature since December 2015.\n\n\n=== The arts ===\nMontevideo has a very rich architectural heritage and an impressive number of writers, artists, and musicians. Uruguayan tango is a unique form of dance that originated in the neighbourhoods of Montevideo towards the end of the 1800s. Tango, candombe and murga are the three main styles of music in this city. The city is also the centre of the cinema of Uruguay, which includes commercial, documentary and experimental films. There are two movie theatre companies running seven cinemas, around ten independent ones and four art film cinemas in the city. The theatre of Uruguay is admired inside and outside Uruguayan borders. The Sol\u00eds Theatre is the most prominent theatre in Uruguay and the oldest in South America. There are several notable theatrical companies and thousands of professional actors and amateurs. Montevideo playwrights produce dozens of works each year; of major note are Mauricio Rosencof, Ana Magnabosco and Ricardo Prieto. \n\n\n==== Visual arts ====\n\nThe daily newspaper El Pa\u00eds sponsors the Virtual Museum of contemporary Uruguayan art. The director and curator of the Museum presents exhibitions in \"virtual spaces, supplemented by information, biographies, texts in English and Spanish\".In the early 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo, one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a \"hotbed of resistance\". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nThe first public library in Montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of Father Jos\u00e9 Manuel P\u00e9rez Castellano, who died in 1815. Its promoter, director and organizer was Father D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga, who also made a considerable donation along with donations from Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Guerra, as well as others from the Convent of San Francisco in Salta. In 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes. The current building of the National Library of Uruguay (Biblioteca P\u00fablica de Uruguay) was designed by Luis Crespi in the Neoclassical style and occupies an area of 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). Construction began in 1926 and it was finally inaugurated in 1964. Its current collection amounts to roughly 900,000 volumes.\n\n\n===== Authors =====\n\nThe city has a long and rich literary tradition. Although Uruguayan literature is not limited to the authors of the capital (Horacio Quiroga was born in Salto and Mario Benedetti in Paso de los Toros, for instance), Montevideo has been and is the centre of the editorial and creative activity of literature.\nIn 1900, the city had a remarkable group of writers, including Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Julio Herrera y Reissig, Delmira Agustini and Felisberto Hern\u00e1ndez. Montevideo was then called the \"Atenas del Plata\" or the \"Athens of the Rio de la Plata\".\n\nAmong the outstanding authors of Montevideo of the second half of the 20th century are Juan Carlos Onetti, Antonio Larreta, Eduardo Galeano, Marosa di Giorgio and Cristina Peri Rossi.A new generation of writers have become known internationally in recent years. These include Eduardo Espina (essayist and poet), Fernando Butazzoni (novelist), Rafael Courtoisie (poet) and Hugo Burel (short story writer and novelist).\n\n\n==== Music ====\nIn Montevideo, as throughout the Rio de Plata region, the most popular forms of music are tango, milonga and vals criollo. Many notable songs originated in Montevideo including \"El Tango supremo\", La Cumparsita\", La Milonga\", \"La Pu\u00f1alada\" and \"Desde el Alma\", composed by notable Montevideo musicians such as Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez, Pint\u00edn Castellanos and Rosita Melo. Tango is deeply ingrained in the cultural life of the city and is the theme for many of the bars and restaurants in the city. Fun Fun' Bar, established in 1935, is one of the most important places for tango in Uruguay as is El Farolito, located in the old part of the city and Joventango, Caf\u00e9 Las Musas, Garufa and Vieja Viola. The city is also home to the Montevideo Jazz Festival and has the Bancaria Jazz Club bar catering for jazz enthusiasts.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe center of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto (\"Port Market\"). Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. A torta frita is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the centre for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt. Montevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Recreation ===\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nA Cultural Centre of Spain, as well as Asturian and cultural centres, testify to Montevideo's considerable Spanish heritage. Montevideo also has important museums including Museo Torres Garc\u00eda, Museo Jos\u00e9 Gurvich, Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales and Museo Juan Manuel Blanes etc.\nThe Montevideo Cabildo was the seat of government during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata. It is located in front of Constitution Square, in Ciudad Vieja. Built between 1804 and 1869 in Neoclassical style, with a series of Doric and Ionic columns, it became a National Heritage Site in 1975. In 1958, the Municipal Historic Museum and Archive was inaugurated here. It features three permanent city museum exhibitions, as well as temporary art exhibitions, cultural events, seminars, symposiums and forums.\n\nThe Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo's first theatre (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules-L\u00e9on Chifflot who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site. The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts, ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th\u201318th century from the area of present-day Iran. The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government.\n\nThe National History Museum of Montevideo is located in the historical residence of General Fructuoso Rivera. It exhibits artifacts related to the history of Uruguay. In a process begun in 1998, the National Museum of Natural History (1837) and the National Museum of Anthropology (1981), merged in 2001, becoming the National Museum of Natural History and Anthropology. In July 2009, the two institutions again became independent. The Historical Museum has annexed eight historical houses in the city, five of which are located in the Ciudad Vieja. One of them, on the same block with the main building, is the historic residence of Antonio Montero, which houses the Museo Romantico.\n\nThe Museo Torres Garc\u00eda is located in the Old Town, and exhibits Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda's unusual portraits of historical icons and cubist paintings akin to those of Picasso and Braque. The museum was established by Manolita Pi\u00f1a Torres, the widow of Torres Garcia, after his death in 1949. She also set up the Garc\u00eda Torres Foundation, a private non-profit organization that organizes the paintings, drawings, original writings, archives, objects and furniture designed by the painter as well as the photographs, magazines and publications related to him.\n\nThere are several other important art museums in Montevideo. The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rod\u00f3 has Uruguay's largest collection of paintings. The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930, the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay, significant with regard to the fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes. In back of the museum is a Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp. The Museo de Historia del Arte, located in the Palacio Municipal, features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period. The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial, in the Ciudad Vieja, has preserved collections of the archaeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archaeologist Antonio Taddei. These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America, painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Museo de Arte Contempo has small but impressive exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture.There are also other types of museums in the city. The Museo del Gaucho y de la Moneda, located in the Centro, has distinctive displays of the historical culture of Uruguay's gauchos, their horse gear, silver work and mate (tea), gourds, and bombillas (drinking straws) in odd designs. The Museo Naval, is located on the eastern waterfront in Buceo and offers exhibits depicting the maritime history of Uruguay. The Museo del Autom\u00f3vil, belonging to the Automobile Club of Uruguay, has a rich collection of vintage cars which includes a 1910 Hupmobile. The Museo y Parque Fernando Garc\u00eda in Carrasco, a transport and automobile museum, includes old horse carriages and some early automobiles. The Castillo Pittamiglio, with an unusual fa\u00e7ade, highlights the eccentric legacy of Humberto Pittamiglio, local alchemist and architect.\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\n\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is home to a number of festivals and carnivals including a Gaucho festival when people ride through the streets on horseback in traditional gaucho gear. The major annual festival is the annual Montevideo Carnival which is part of the national festival of Carnival Week, celebrated throughout Uruguay, with central activities in the capital, Montevideo. Officially, the public holiday lasts for two days on Carnival Monday and Shrove Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, but due to the prominence of the festival, most shops and businesses close for the entire week.\nDuring carnival there are many open-air stage performances and competitions and the streets and houses are vibrantly decorated. \"Tablados\" or popular scenes, both fixed and movable, are erected in the whole city. Notable displays include \"Desfile de las Llamadas\" (\"Parade of the Calls\"), which is a grand united parade held on the south part of downtown, where it used to be a common ritual back in the early 20th century. Due to the scale of the festival, preparation begins as early as December with an election of the \"zonal beauty queens\" to appear in the carnival.\n\n\n==== Sports ====\n\nEstadio Centenario, the national football stadium in Parque Batlle, was opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay's first constitution. In this World Cup, Uruguay won the title game against Argentina by 4 goals to 2. The stadium has 70,000 seats. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums, along with Maracan\u00e3, Wembley Stadium, San Siro, Estadio Azteca, and Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. A museum located within the football stadium has exhibits of memorabilia from Uruguay's 1930 and 1950 World Cup championships. Museum tickets give access to the stadium, stands, locker rooms and playing field.Between 1935 and 1938, the athletics track and the municipal velodrome were completed within Parque Batlle. The Tabar\u00e9 Athletic Club is occasionally made over as a carnival theatre using impermanent materials.\n\nToday the vast majority of teams in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n come from Montevideo, including Nacional, Pe\u00f1arol, Central Espa\u00f1ol, Cerrito, Cerro, Danubio, Defensor Sporting, Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9nix, Liverpool, Wanderers, Racing, River Plate, Club Atl\u00e9tico Torque and Rampla Juniors.\nBesides Estadio Centenario, other stadiums include Estadio Campeon del Siglo, Pe\u00f1arol, Gran Parque Central, Belvedere, Complejo Rentistas, Jardines del Hip\u00f3dromo, Jos\u00e9 Pedro Damiani, \"La Bombonera\", Luis Franzini, Luis Tr\u00f3ccoli and the park stadiums of Abraham Paladino, Alfredo V\u00edctor Viera, Omar Saroldi, Jos\u00e9 Nasazzi, Osvaldo Roberto, Maracan\u00e1 and Palermo.\nThe city has a tradition as host of major international basketball tournaments including the official 1967 FIBA World Cup and the 1988 1997 and 2017 editions of the official Americas Basketball Championship.\nThe Uruguayan Basketball League is headquartered in Montevideo and most of its teams are from the city, including Defensor Sporting, Bigu\u00e1, Aguada, Goes, Malv\u00edn, Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tica, and Trouville. Montevideo is also a centre of rugby; equestrianism, which regained importance in Montevideo after the Maro\u00f1as Racecourse reopened; golf, with the Club de Punta Carretas; and yachting, with the Puerto del Buceo, an ideal place to moor yachts. The Golf Club of Punta Carretas was founded in 1894 covers all the area encircled by the west side of Bulevar Artigas, the Rambla (Montevideo's promenade) and the Parque Rod\u00f3 (Fun Fair).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChurch and state are officially separated since 1916 in Uruguay. The religion with most followers in Montevideo is Roman Catholicism and has been so since the foundation of the city. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montevideo was created as the Apostolic Vicariate of Montevideo in 1830. The vicariate was promoted to the Diocese of Montevideo on 13 July 1878. Pope Leo XIII elevated it to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese on 14 April 1897. The new archdiocese became the Metropolitan of the suffragan sees of Canelones, Florida, Maldonado\u2013Punta del Este, Melo, Mercedes, Minas, Salto, San Jos\u00e9 de Mayo, Tacuaremb\u00f3.\nMontevideo is the only archdiocese in Uruguay and, as its Ordinary, the archbishop is also Primate of the Catholic Church in Uruguay. The archdiocese's mother church and thus seat of its archbishop is Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n y San Felipe y Santiago. As of 2010, the current Archbishop of Montevideo is Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet, SDB, since his appointment on 11 February 2014.Other religious faiths in Montevideo are Protestantism, Umbanda, Judaism, and there are many people who define themselves as Atheists and Agnostics, while others profess \"believing in God but without religion\".\n\n\n==== Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral ====\n\nThe Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Roman Catholic church of Montevideo. It is located in Ciudad Vieja, immediately across Constitution Square from the Cabildo. In 1740 a brick church was built on the site. In 1790, the foundation was laid for the current neoclassical structure. The church was consecrated in 1804. Bicentennial celebrations were held in 2004.\nIn 1897, Pope Leo XIII elevated the church to Metropolitan Cathedral status. Important ceremonies are conducted under the direction of the Archbishop of Montevideo. Weddings and choral concerts are held here and the parish priest conducts the routine functions of the cathedral. In the 19th century, its precincts were also used as a burial place of famous people who died in the city. For decades, the prison and the nearby Punta Carretas parish church were the only major buildings in the neighbourhood.\n\n\n==== Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n ====\n\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (\"Our Lady of the Sacred Heart\"), also known as Iglesia Punta Carretas (\"Punta Carretas Church\"), was built between 1917 and 1927 in the Romanesque Revival style. The church was originally part of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, but is presently in the parish of the Ecclesiastic Curia. Its location is at the corner of Solano Garc\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 Ellauri. It has a nave and aisles. The roof has many vaults. During the construction of the Punta Carretas Shopping complex, major cracks developed in the structure of the church as a result of differential foundation settlement.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is the economic and political centre of the country. Most of the largest and wealthiest businesses in Uruguay have their headquarters in the city. Since the 1990s the city has undergone rapid economic development and modernization, including two of Uruguay's most important buildings\u2014the World Trade Center Montevideo (1998), and Telecommunications Tower (2000), the headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company ANTEL, increasing the city's integration into the global marketplace.The Port of Montevideo, in the northern part of Ciudad Vieja, is one of the major ports of South America and plays a very important role in the city's economy. The port has been growing rapidly and consistently at an average annual rate of 14 percent due to an increase in foreign trade. The city has received a US$20 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to modernize the port, increase its size and efficiency, and enable lower maritime and river transportation costs.The most important state-owned companies headquartered in Montevideo are: AFE (railways), ANCAP (Energy), Administracion Nacional de Puertos (Ports), ANTEL (telecommunications), BHU (savings and loan), BROU (bank), BSE (insurance), OSE (water & sewage), UTE (electricity). These companies operate under public law, using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called Ente Autonomo (\"autonomous entity\"). The government also owns part of other companies operating under private law, such as those owned wholly or partially by the CND (National Development Corporation).\nBanking has traditionally been one of the strongest service export sectors in Uruguay: the country was once dubbed \"the Switzerland of America\", mainly for its banking sector and stability, although that stability has been threatened in the 21st century by the recent global economic climate. The largest bank in Uruguay is Banco Republica (BROU), based in Montevideo. Almost 20 private banks, most of them branches of international banks, operate in the country (Banco Santander, BBVA, ABN AMRO, Citibank, among others). There are also a myriad of brokers and financial-services bureaus, among them Ficus Capital, Galfin Sociedad de Bolsa, Europa Sociedad de Bolsa, Dar\u00edo Cukier, GBU, Horde\u00f1ana & Asociados Sociedad de Bolsa, etc.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism accounts for much of Uruguay's economy. Tourism in Montevideo is centered in the Ciudad Vieja area, which includes the city's oldest buildings, several museums, art galleries, and nightclubs, with Sarand\u00ed Street and the Mercado del Puerto being the most frequented venues of the old city. On the edge of Ciudad Vieja, Plaza Independencia is surrounded by many sights, including the Sol\u00eds Theatre and the Palacio Salvo; the plaza also constitutes one end of 18 de Julio Avenue, the city's most important tourist destination outside of Ciudad Vieja. Apart from being a shopping street, the avenue is noted for its Art Deco buildings, three important public squares, the Gaucho Museum, the Palacio Municipal and many other sights. The avenue leads to the Obelisk of Montevideo; beyond that is Parque Batlle, which along with the Parque Prado is another important tourist destination. Along the coast, the Fortaleza del Cerro, the Rambla (the coastal avenue), 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) of sandy beaches, and Punta Gorda attract many tourists, as do the Barrio Sur and Palermo barrios.The Ministry of Tourism offers a two-and-a-half-hour city tour and the Montevideo Tourist Guide Association offers guided tours in English, Italian, Portuguese and German. Apart from these, many private companies offer organized city tours.\nMost tourists to the city come from Argentina, Brazil and Europe, with the number of visitors from elsewhere in Latin America and from the United States growing every year, thanks to an increasing number of international airline arrivals at Carrasco International Airport as well as cruises that arrive into the port of Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\nMontevideo has over 50 hotels, mostly located in the city centre or along the beachfront of the Rambla de Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nMontevideo is the heartland of retailing in Uruguay. The city has become the principal centre of business and real estate, including many expensive buildings and modern towers for residences and offices, surrounded by extensive green spaces. In 1985, the first shopping centre in Rio de la Plata, Montevideo Shopping was built. In 1994, with building of three more shopping complexes such as the Shopping Tres Cruces, Portones Shopping, and Punta Carretas Shopping, the business map of the city changed dramatically. The creation of shopping complexes brought a major change in the habits of the people of Montevideo. Global firms such as McDonald's and Burger King etc. are firmly established in Montevideo.\nApart from the big shopping complexes, the main retailing venues of the city are: most of 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro and Cord\u00f3n barrios, a length of Agraciada Avenue in the Paso de Molino area of Belvedere, a length of Arenal Grande St. and the\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nOut of the 100 radio stations found in Uruguay, 40 of them are in Montevideo. The city has a vibrant artistic and literary community. The press enjoyed full freedom until the advent of the Civic-military dictatorship (1973\u20131985); this freedom returned on 1 March 1985, as part of the restoration of democracy.\nSome of the important newspapers published in the city are: Brecha, La Republica, El Observador, El Pa\u00eds, Gaceta Comercial and La Diaria. El D\u00eda was the most prestigious paper in Uruguay, founded in 1886 by Jos\u00e9 Batlle, who would later go on to become President of Uruguay. The paper ceased production in the early 1990s. All television stations have their headquarters in Montevideo, for example: Saeta Channel 10, Teledoce, Channel 4 and National Television (Channel 5)\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte (DNT), part of the national Ministry of Transport and Public Works, is responsible for the organization and development of Montevideo's transport infrastructure. A bus service network covers the entire city. An international bus station, the Tres Cruces Bus Station, is located on the lower level of the Tres Cruces Shopping Center, on the side of Artigas Boulevard. This terminal, along with the Baltazar Brum Bus Terminal (or Rio Branco Terminal) by the Port of Montevideo, handles the long distance and intercity bus routes connecting to destinations within Uruguay.\n\nThe State Railways Administration of Uruguay (AFE) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the Empalme Olmos, San Jose and Florida. These lines operate to major suburban areas of Canelones, San Jos\u00e9 and Florida. Within the Montevideo city limits, local trains stop at Lorenzo Carnelli, Yatai (Step Mill), Sayago, Columbus (line to San Jose and Florida), Pe\u00f1arol and Manga (line Empalme Olmos) stations. The historic 19th century General Artigas Central Station located in the neighbourhood of Aguada, six blocks from the central business district, was abandoned 1 March 2003 and remains closed. A new station, 500 metres (1,600 ft) north of the old one and part of the Tower of Communications modern complex, has taken over the rail traffic.Carrasco International Airport (IATA: MVD, ICAO: SUMU), which serves Montevideo, is located 19 km (12 mi) from the city centre. Several international airlines operate there. The airport serves over 1,500,000 passengers annually. \u00c1ngel S. Adami Airport is a private airport operated by minor charter companies.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Montevideo, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 65 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 18% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.2 km, while 6% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nThe port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbour entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of R\u00edo de la Plata, Buenos Aires.\nThe main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, until the 21st century, physical changes had ceased, and since that time the area had degraded due to national economic stagnation.The port's proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.Every year more than one hundred cruises arrive, bringing tourists to Montevideo by public or private tours.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Public education ===\nThe University of the Republic is the country's largest and most important university, with a student body of 81,774, according to the census of 2007. It was founded on 18 July 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its current Rector is Dr. Rodrigo Arocena. The university houses 14 faculties (departments) and various institutes and schools. Many eminent Uruguayans have graduated from this university, including Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Jos\u00e9 Luis Massera, Gabriel Paternain, Mario Wschebor, Roman Fresnedo Siri, Carlos Ott and Eladio Dieste\nThe process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time.\n\n\n=== Private education ===\nThe largest private university in Uruguay, is also located in Montevideo. ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942, and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996, becoming the second private educational institution in the country to achieve that status. It is a member of World ORT, an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nThe university has about 8,000 students, distributed among 5 faculties and institutes, mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering. Its current rector as of 2010 is Dr. Jorge A. Gr\u00fcnberg.\nThe Montevideo Crandon Institute is an American School of missionary origin and the main Methodist educational institution in Uruguay. Founded in 1879 and supported by the Women's Society of the Methodist Church of the United States, it is one of the most traditional and emblematic institutions in the city inculcating John Wesley's values. Its alumni include presidents, senators, ambassadors and Nobel Prize winners, along with musicians, scientists, and others. The Montevideo Crandon Institute boasts of being the first academic institution in South America where a home economics course was taught.\n\nThe Christian Brothers of Ireland Stella Maris College is a private, co-educational, not-for-profit Catholic school located in the wealthy residential southeastern neighbourhood of Carrasco. Established in 1955, it is regarded as one of the best high schools in the country, blending a rigorous curriculum with strong extracurricular activities. The school's headmaster, history professor Juan Pedro Toni, is a member of the Stella Maris Board of Governors and the school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Its long list of distinguished former pupils includes economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school's alumni club.\nAlso in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo, one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, founded in 1908 with \"the object of giving children a complete education, both intellectual and moral, based upon the ideas and principles of the best schools in The British Isles\".\nThe School is governed by the Board of Governors, elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay, whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay. Prominent alumni include former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry Herr\u00e1n and Gabriel Gurm\u00e9ndez Armand-Ugon.\nLocated in Cordon, St.Brendan's school, previously named St.Catherine's is a non-profit civil association, which has a solid institutional culture with a clear vision of the future. It is knowned for being one of the best schools in the country, joining students from the wealthiest parts of Montevideo, such us, Punta Carretas, Pocitos, Malvin and Carrasco.\nSt. Brendan's School is a bilingual, non-denominational school that promotes a pedagogical constructivist approach focused on the child as a whole. In this approach, understanding is built from the connections children make between their own prior knowledge and the learning experiences, thus developing critical thinking skills. It is also the only school in the country implementing the three International Baccalaureate Programmes. These are:\n\nDiploma Programme \u2013 Pre-University course for students aged 16 to 19. The Diploma Programme is a two-year curriculum.\nMYP -Middle Years Programme. For students aged 12 to 16.\nPYP \u2013 Primary Years Programme. For students aged 3 to 12.Other educational institutions of note include Colegio Ingles, Instituto Preuniversitario Salesiano Juan XXIII, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Montevideo, Ivy Thomas, German School of Montevideo and Colegio Preuniversitario Ciudad de San Felipe.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nIn Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by polyclinics and hospitals or sanatorios. The term hospital is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while sanatorio is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.\n\n\n=== Public hospitals ===\nHospital de Cl\u00ednicas \"Dr. Manuel Quintela\" is a University Hospital attached to the University of the Republic, and is located on Avenida Italia. It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928\u20131929 and has a surface area of 110,000 square metres (1,200,000 sq ft) on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr. Hugo Villar, who was a considerable influence on the institution.\nHospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaran\u00ed and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of Jos\u00e9 Toribio (son of Tom\u00e1s Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaran\u00ed street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaran\u00ed and 25 de Mayo) and Juli\u00e1n Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Est\u00e9vez in 1798.Hospital Pereira Rossell was founded in 1908 and was built on land donated in late 1900 by Alexis Rossell y Rius and Dolores Pereira de Rossell. It was the city's first pediatric hospital, and shortly afterwards the addition of an obstetric and gynaecological clinic in 1915 made it the first maternity hospital as well. Later, the hospital received a donation from Dr. Enrique Pouey for a radiotherapy unit.\nHospital Vilardeb\u00f3 is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist Teodoro Vilardeb\u00f3 Matuliche, it opened 21 May 1880. The hospital was originally one of the best of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel. It has an emergency service, outpatient, clinic and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others. The average patient age is 30 years; more than half of the patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.\nOther public polyclinics and hospitals of note include the Hospital Saint Bois, founded 18 November 1928, which consists of a General Hospital and Eye Hospital; the Pasteur Hospital in La Uni\u00f3n neighbourhood; the Hospital Espa\u00f1ol, which was founded in 1886, passed to the private sector in the 20th century, closed in 2004 and was restored and reinaugurated in 2007 as the municipal Juan Jose Crottogini Polyclinic; the National Cancer Institute; and the National Institute of Trauma and Orthopedics.\n\n\n=== Private healthcare ===\nPrivate healthcare is offered by many private health insurance companies, each of which has one or more polyclinics and owns or is associated with one or more hospitals. Private medical facilities of note include the Hospital Brit\u00e1nico, the Italian Hospital of Montevideo, Mutualista CASMU's Sanatoria I, II, III and IV, the Evangelical Hospital, M\u00e9dica Uruguaya, Sanatorio de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, Sanatorios del C\u00edrculo Cat\u00f3lico, Sanatorio Casa de Galicia and Sanatorio GREMCA.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nMontevideo is twinned with:\n\nMontevideo is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities since 12 October 1982.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nAlbes, Edward.

          "Every city seems to have one and I seem to take a photo of it in every city. I'm not really sure why.",
          "We saw this all over South America: a location's name spelled out in huge 3D letters that tourists can pose in, around and on, usually with something picturesque in the background. Did the idea start here, with the famous \"Montevideo\" sign? The sign is just off the Rambla",
          "It's great to take photos of these city signs, especially when the background is so pretty. In the background of this sign, is a skyline of Montevideo along La Rambla, a 10 mile upscale ride along the waterfront. Our Uber driver was kind enough to stop here while we took",
          "........we did it too. Can't come all the way to Montevideo and not pose for a photo at the famous sign. We did it too and have the photos to prove it!",
          "Don't leave Montevideo without taking a picture. There were a few people when we went but everyone wanted to get on top of the sign. So you have to take a picture the best that you can but do stop by.",
          "A fun little stop along the Rambla for a touristy picture of yourself in front of the sign. Of course, a bunch of other people are trying to do the same thing, so expect the normal collision of a bunch of people all trying to take the same shot.",
          "Great place to take photos of your friends with the beach as background. Sign is now painted with a variety of scenes.",
          "It was painted red, white, blue and black and had smudges of dirty on it. The crowds come and go. But they are generally nice if you want to take a picture on it alone. It looks a bit grimy though. The City of Montevideo should clean it up a bit. Maybe add some grass around it.",
          "This is usually crowded but still worth to see Pocitos beach and neighbourhood from there. Also a good photo to take. The sign is usually in White colour but they paint it for different events that take place in the city, which I think it's nice.",
          "I've seen so many photos of this sign being white but today is primarily blue. My guess is that it regularly is repainted. It's hard to miss for us since we stayed across the street at the Hyatt Centric Montevideo. If you want a photo with no people - you should get there early.",
          "Fun iconic landmark of with overlooking the beautiful beach. There is typically a crowd waiting to take a photo!",
          "Good luck getting a picture without scads of other people present. There's always a crowd at this tourist magnet. Nonetheless, the view of the Pocitos Rambla is beautiful from here, so it's well worth the walk to get here. There are also nice sunset views near here. And the",
          "Fun sign, which is apparently repainted periodically. Great view of the river. A good place for pictures.",
          "This is a very popular tourist attraction as everyone wants their picture taken here with the backdrop of the beach and skyline. It is located in the bay area of Pocitos. The sign often changes colors as it is painted to support different causes.",
          "Well worth going to see. After touring the city and surrounding areas we made it to the Montevideo sign. Beautiful views of the beach area, and fun time getting a group picture with the sign.",
          "Comparing this to say... Aruba where you can hardly take your picture due to so many people doing it. This is a bland signage which matches the drab gray color of their city.",
          "We stopped here on our tour so everyone could have their special Kodak Moment and take their pics with the sign over looking the ocean and beach.",
          "Not sure what to say about this other than it\u2019s a photo opportunity on one of the many beautiful beaches outside Montevideo city. You might have to queue up and wait your turn but you can get some fun pics if you are creative.",
          "The Montevideo Sign (Letrero de Montevideo ) is an icon of the vibrant city of Uruguay that will capture everyone\u2019s eyes upon entering the city! A must see attraction to pose and get a pic that is InstaGram worthy!",
          "This is a selfie-must! Excellent view of Pocitos and the Rambla and plenty of open space renders it a cracking place for a picknick!",
          "Every major South American city seems to have a sign like this (typically in a main plaza), but this location on Pocitos beach is particularly perfect for photo opportunities. Worth the visit while in the Pocitos area on a nice day.",
          "The must see place in Montevideo. From the small hillock you can see the modern city behind you along the bay. The place for a selfie!",
          "Take a picture and move on! This is just an over-hyped sign, no more, meant for tourist selfies. Worth 5 minutes at most.",
          "Why I say the changing sign; the colour changed three times in the 15 days we were in Montevideo; it never seems to be the same. This is one of the must do for a few minutes activities; it also looks amazing at night.",
          "Great way to show where you have been. Plenty of locals and tourists around for people watching. No need to spend much time there.",
          "It is the view behind the sign that makes a trip to this part of the Rambla in the southeast of the city worthwhile. Hopefully you will not run into any photographer with a drone trying to sell the desperate overpriced photographs. Its white is an appropriate colour as the city",
          "but if you are passing then why not. This isnt one of the best of this type I have seen but there is a good view behind it. It was probably the quietest I have been to so that was a plus, you just need patience if you want to be the only ones in the picture. Otherwise a couple",
          "We drove to the sign and luckily it was not that busy. Lots of folks come here for photos! From it you can get a good view of the city and it beaches and shoreline. Apart from the sign, there is not much else to do!",
          "Located on the south east side of the city next to Rambla, this place offer a great view of the mini skyline and the La Plata River.",
          "A great quick stop for a photo opportunity. Recommend riding a scooter up the rambla to get there!!!",
          "Walk the whole La Rambla and end here to take a photo. It\u2019s a cool photo opp and you don\u2019t need to spend more than a few mins here but definitely make it part of a lovely Rambla stroll",
          "Stopped here on city tour. Stunning location overlooking beautiful beaches in city. Not much more to say or do but with a visit for a photo-opportunity",
          "What city doesn't have one of these? It's a MUST for your photo memories album. The MONTEVIDEO sign overlooks a beautiful beach and cityscape for a gorgeous background! If you are part of a bus tour you will have to wait your turn but worth it.",
          "Stopped here during our one-day visit to Montevideo (we were on a Norwegian cruise in February 2018). We elected to have our photos taken by a guy that had a camera set up on a drone, and we were so glad we did. It was super cheap, and then he actually air-dropped the photos to",
          "Simple thing, yet a landmark. Nicely illuminated in the evening and until early morning. Best pictures and less people then.",
          "I have been in Montevideo many times with different groups of friends, and we always stop here for a group picture. Every picture is a little different, since the letters of the sign are painted/decorated differently every time according to historic holidays or cultural events.",
          "For those wanting to have their photos taken at the sign, I wold advise them to go either early in the morning, when there is less crowded, or latest by 3pm. As the sun sun moves to set for the day, it will be difficult to get a decent photo with the sign due to back-lighting.",
          "Good photo opportunity with lovely back drop, can use hop on hop off bus tour to get near it if staying nearer port",
          "If you can actually get close to it to have a photo taken, do so. There was a cruise ship in town and many little mini buses pulled up and everyone rushed to the sign for photos. But it seems to be iconic.",
          "Like in many other places we've visited, the Montevideo sign provides good photo ops in the Pocitos barrio, which tourists speculate at the most. Snap a photo and get going!",
          "This is a very nice place for a quick photo-op. The only problem is that depending what time of the day you go, the sun may be on the right or wrong position for taking a picture. When we were there, we took a picture from the reverse (back) side of the sign because at the front",
          "Right along the beach. Used to be white but now is painted blue with pictures painted showing the tango and other local items",
          "The sign faces east so the best lighting is morning. I was there well before 8am, as soon as the sun rose above the palm trees I climbed onto the V for the photo op. A few tourists around so we took photos for each other. Currently painted blue which is a poor choice with the",
          "The Montevideo sign is a large iconic sign with it's name spelled out in large letters; perfect for a photo op. The sign sits on a hill overlooking the river and beachfront, and there is a nice walkway along here which many locals as well as tourists congregate too. The sign",
          "This is a fun place for photo's, it's easy to access by car,, .. The name sign itself is about 15ft in length and the letters are about 6ft in height, so a wide angle camera is best for that memorable shot!!! It' sits on an incline grass bank...it sit above a magnificent",
          "We got caught at the sign on a very rainy day. Lots of people (mostly very young) trying to take interesting photos with no regards to everyone who was waiting in the pouring rain. That was not fun...Go there for photos on a nice day otherwise skip it. You won\u2019t be missing much",
          "Nice place to take a photo of the sign and beach, but not much else apart from that. It's a stopover in your day trip to Montevideo",
          "Big letters. Most of the time there is a big crowd around it trying to take photos. So you may have to wait for your photo with no one else in it.",
          "I'm not sure why they put up these signs all over South America, but on your tour, stop and take a photo. Why not?",
          "Nice sign in the middle of the Rambla. Great spot for pictures and a must visit while in Montevideo!!!",
          "Great location for a lovely view of the city and beaches in the background. Lots of folks taking pics. What else can one say?",
          "Do not miss this famous spot where you can be photographed close or on top of Montevideo sign. A must see for any tourists once in town.",
          "Witnessed a horrible theft at this place (which is tacky and to be avoided in any event): a lady had her bag snatched by a guy on a motorbike who smashed an elderly man to the floor leaving him with multiple cuts and bruises and understandably very shaken. The police watched and",
          "We went early in the morning and no one was there so we were able to take our time for photo opportunity. Would be way better if each letter was in a different colour like most other city name signs",
          "Tourist buses always stop at the Montevideo sign, just at the edge of Pocitos, so that people can climb up and take photos. But while the sign is white most of the year, there have been some interesting changes worth watching for. When we visited in January, it was painted to",
          "A popular spot BUT lots of friendly touristas that will be happy to get you in that iconic photograph. Yes it\u2019s cheesy. Yes it\u2019s busy. But it\u2019s fun fun fun.",
          "We cycled here and the views along the way are great. Worth seeing the coast/waterfront but it was very busy and hard to get a photo.",
          "Good place to take a picture of the Pocitos beach! It\u2019i considered the small Copacabana! I liked it!!",
          "Check out the sign, get your pictures in, then go for a walk down the beach. It is right next to the sign, and has some pretty good views from this area. Can be a lot of people here all doing the same thing, so if you want a picture with just you in it, you might have to be",
          "We walked here from our hostel in Palermo, it took about 30mins. A must see if the sun is out, the Rambla is a great way to see the coastline and get some exercise. There is a guy at the sign who has a drone and can take pictures of you on the sign for $10USD, and a video for an",
          "This spot on La Rambla was very busy every time we passed it--even at night. Catching a time when there were no people sitting or standing on the letters was a stroke of good luck.",
          "We moved here a few months ago. We enjoy going to the sign day and night. It gets painted with different designs for every event. There's usually someone there who will do a drone photo for about $10. It gets crowded but it's a must see.",
          "The main problem basically is that in general people do not respect each other. Everybody wants to take a good photo, with no other interference... So when there some people put their children on the sign letters and simply forget them there, or some other escalate and stayed",
          "Late April was in Montevideo and went to take pictures at Montevideo sign , quite far up along the seafront, after seeing photos of the snazzy coloured sign taken by friends in March. When we got there found that sign had been painted plain white. Quite disappointing as the",
          "The Montevideo Sign is a popular photo opportunity. From this location you get a great view of the beach and waterfront buildings. When we visited in March the sign was painted for Carnival 2018.",
          "We went in low season, and it\u2019s worth the trek to it, but expect to wait if other people are there, especially families, we waitied for one family 20 mins, if you only want yourself in the shot, then it\u2019s worth the wait.",
          "I like the sign, but why is so popular. People taking pictures, seating on top of the letters, but why only montevideo, the full name San Felipe y Santigo deMontevideo will give extra room for all the turists and people won't have to wait for pictures.",
          "Beside the Rambla there is Montevideo sign. After a long walk through whole rambla i reached the point. The green grass slopy nature of grounds attack me. Many people climb the sign and click photos.",
          "Don\u2019t expect too much,i have been there since its located just opposite of my hotel.nice sea shore for a walk but the sea looks a bit mudy",
          "The sign is nice, but the real reason to stop here is that there is a nice view of the beach and shoreline behind the sign. But the sign is a nice photo op, especially if you have kids who need to climb on something",
          "The sign is often painted in different colors, so not always white. It sits right on the Rambla in a curve. From here you can take some very nice pictures of the beach and the Montevideo skyline. You won't be alone, so ask a stranger to take a picture of you with your camera. It",
          "The MONTEVIDEO letters are constantly changing, Preferably go in the morning as the sun faces it in the afternoon. Nice place to take a good shot, however you have to be patient and wait your turn as dozens of tourists want to have the same experience!",
          "If you like mobs of crazy people milling around and hanging all over the sign and taking pictures, you\u2019ll love this place. Couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there. The view behind the sign is spectacular though lol P.S. this was the only picture I could get without a swarm of people",
          "I suppose it tells the photo viewers that you made it to Montevideo, but it is just a sign. It was across the street from my hotel, so I walked by it and was a photographer for multiple families that wanted to take a photo there. They loved it. If you are there, go ahead and",
          "Unless you feel a burning desire to have your photo with the Montevideo sign, there's no need to seek it out specifically. It is a nice photo-op but you'll probably just stumble across it while walking la Rambla; certainly wouldn't recommend a significant trek to go see it.",
          "It is just a stop very close to the beach to take the typical picture of the city. Nothing special but I did it.",
          "If you are in Montevideo, you need to go Pocitos beach to enjoy a great view, place to walk and off course take a pic with the word \"Montevideo\" behind of you",
          "Nice view of the beach on Platt river. Find a local or another tourist and take your photo in front of the Montevideo sign with beach in background below.",
          "Yes..it's a sign, and it is the city name, but it's nothing more than that. The backdrop isn't anything special! Still it's a nice walk along the promenade and beach to the sign.",
          "So many towns have special \"signs\" that this is not anything special. Sure, if you are there, it is nice to see, but don't go out of your way.",
          "A very place to stroll along the coast and then get that iconic photo of this sign with the sea/coast behind. It's a great walk and a great photo!",
          "Astonishing view and a great place to take beautiful pictures of Montevideo. Must go! At night it's lit!",
          "I suggest you stop by on the way to or from the airport. It is about 12 minutes from the airport if you are coming from the main street of the coast/La Rambla. Go, have the pic and have some fun. Good luck",
          "Always cool to take a photo there :) from there you have a nice view to the playa pocitos... We walked there. Its an 1 hour walk from the hostel MedioMundo. But drink a coffee first and take water with you because there is no restaurant on the way... October 2017",
          "A city puts it's name on display like this to highlight what it thinks is it's best view. Well, they got it right - it is the best view of Montevideo!",
          "Beach is right in view but I wouldn't get in water. Lots of nice women walking around and a very cool place to be",
          "The nice thing about this hot spot is, if you are lucky to go in summer or in a sunny day,you\u00b4ll take a great picture with a nice view of the uruguayan capital. At night is another great option too :D",
          "The Montevideo sign is a tourist magnet a must do when visiting - take photo in front of sign with the Rio de Plata in the background",
          "It is a very traditional place for visitors, but usually,during holidays or high season, it is crowded with city tour buses, and it is difficult to take a picture of yourself alone. I was there with a city tour and it is probably the best way though, if you rather not to spend",
          "One of the things you HAVE to do in Montevideo or at least thats what we were told. Nice views and easy to get to.",
          "You must to get to the Montevideo Sign once you are in town. Good photo and nice walk to get there. Quite far from city centre but the walk is nice if sunny day. Great views to enjoy it. On other hand, not described for tourist how to get back city centre from there (walking or",
          "This sign is a very nice opportunity for taking pictures. The reason why i am not giving a higher grade is because the surroundings are not clean... city ahould do more to keep it cleaner.",
          "Great stop for a photo to show the world where you've been. Friendly people transcend language to help each other get the shot without leaving a person out of the shot.",
          "Nice spot to take a photo in Montevideo, one of the main attractions of the city, but sometimes hard to take picture alone !",
          "It was fun visiting the Montevideo sign and taking pictures there to commemorate our visit to this beautiful city!",
          "I had my photo taken with this sign because I found it an unusual sign for a town. After the walking trips we had in this fantastic city, this was our final destination. Fresh air and just a leisurely stroll along the beach.",
          "Our tour stopped for a photo shoot during our tour of the Rambla. Somehow, in a city blighted by graffiti, this sign had escaped or maybe it had been cleaned in the early morning. If you want a photo with the sign as a backdrop, be patient, join the queue of tourists and",
          "We did not think that a picture in front of the sign is necessary but we went anyways and to our surprise everybody was having a good time posing for their photos,taking turns and just like the other reviews say it can get crowded. It is also a great view point to View the",
          "it is just on the hill overlooking the beach of Pocitos, it is a nice chance to get the whole picture and the name of the town, I visited it several times just walking the Rambla....",
          "Stopped by on the way to the countryside for our winetasting. Very popular picture stop along the Atlantic Ocean with a great backdrop of the city and upscale neighbourhood.",
          "The sign itself has nothing special. But as a postcard of the city, must be visited. The view from there is quite nice and you can take some photos of the beach.",
          "The sign was on my obscure bucket list. Good view of the beachfront of Montevideo and the sign is a seflie magnet. Tourist were hospitable and waited for their turn to have the sign for themselves to take a picture. You only need 10-15 minutes at this spot. Nice touch to the",
          "Great and free souvenir from Uruguay. At sunset at just the right moment, you can get a great photo when the sky streaks with hues of orange and pink.",
          "The sign is set so that we get a beautiful view of the harbour area of Montevideo. When we were there, there were so many tourists sitting all over the sign it was hard to spot at first. It does present a good photo opportunity but you have to be quick.",
          "This is just a sigh where people stop to take a picture - nice if you stop by but nothing much about it.",
          "Don't believe the haters who say this is \"just a sign\" or a \"boring tourist gimmick\".. The sign is SO amazing and getting a photo is a must-do when visiting Montevideo. Hot tip: if there are too many annoying people standing at the front, go to the back of the sign, get your",
          "This is a good photo opportunity in Montevideo. it is worth a quick stop. It can be crowded here in summertime.",
          "it\u00b4s a good place to go to take some pictures by before noon otherwise you\u00b4ll have the sun against you.",
          "Overlooking a beach. Don't let the professional photographer scam you out of cash. Ask a fellow tourist to take your photo in front of the large while sign.",
          "We took the bus to Pocitos for one dollar and hopped off right across the street from the sign. We took out pics and enjoyed lunch down in that area to gave authentic Chivitos!",
          "It's a sign overlooking the beach. Can't say it's very exciting. Lots of people like it from what it appears. The city should clean up in front of the sign.",
          "The interesting thing is all the Pocito's shore, not the sing itself, but there were hundreds of people taking pictures with the sing",
          "It's all about the photograph! It's the spot every tourist wants the photograph taken. Go earlier in the day so you can catch a sunrise as well not have to share the sign with other tourists. We had gotten there and had the sign to ourselves and a maintenance crew just about to",
          "This is a great opportunity to show that you were really in Montevideo. This is one of the highlights of the Rambla. Beautiful view of the city. One suggest . . . folks should stand behind the letters; standing in front of the sign takes away from seeing all of the letters and",
          "If you want to show to friends and family that you were really in Montevideo, this is the place. The letters on the sign are large (go sit on one of them, or simply lean against them) and the back drop is stunning.",
          "Great place to visit and take a few pictures and have a seat and enjoy the world go by. Easily accessed and free of charge. Great views of the seafront and part of Montevideo. Would recommend visiting",
          "Nice spot for a photo of Montevideo city and beach in background but when we were there too busy to get a good photo on our own",
          "It's located in a very reachable place. As it is always crowded the best time to be visited is during afternoon as the tours bus will be gone already.",
          "I'm not a big fan of this places that become a mandatory photo of your trip. This was one of the stops on the city tour, the view of the seafront from here justifies the time spent here, but unless you are collecting mandatory photos of your vacations, there is no drama if you",
          "I really try to take a picture alone, but it was impossible The montevideo sign is always full of people and not everyone are well educated",
          "Take a picture with all the tourists here, then check out pocitos a bit. I love Montevideo! It's such a great spot as you have runners and walkers on the rambla.",
          "Yes, it's a tourist thing to do, but we are tourists. It was fun. The sign is well placed and posing there out smiles on our faces.",
          "Sign was well worth a visit, easy to get to and not overly crowded. Can imagine it would be busy with tourists during peak season though. We hired bicycles to get from our hotel to the sign as it is quite a walk from the main part of the city.",
          "long plane ride but worth it ! what a great city to relax walk in la rambla enjoying the nice and welcoming Uruguayan people dollar transfer its great for us which aloud us to be flexible with activities, before you get old i recommend you to take the time to meet this great",
          "Not sure what the attraction here is actually. It is a big, nice looking sign at one end of the Rambla. Stop, take a picture with it an move on I guess. Don't make a special trip, but if you're doing the Rambla, sure, go see it.",
          "It is a wonderful spot to take nice pictures of the Rambla, the beach, the buildings. Lots of fun, and relax!",
          "I visited this site along with fellow participants of a course held in Montevideo! Was a totally fun experience snapping pics at the sign and was one of many memorable experiences of my stay in Uruguay",
          "We stopped at the Montevideo 'sign' on our city tour. It is overlooking a beautiful beach, one of many that you will see and are all along the city coastline. A great spot for photos. Recpommended.",
          "Although a fairly plain sign, the location is great and always fun to climb all over it and get some pics.",
          "The beach and scenery is not so special, but for me this (simple) sign was a cool tourist trophy. I have been there and I liked it. I also expected it to be crowded like hell, but even for an saturday afternoon there was not really much \"traffic\". I think if you like this kind",
          "Everybody should try to come around here to take a picture of the MONTEVIDEO sign. We noticed that the light condition for pictures is better during the morning.",
          "The Montevideo Sign, situated over Pocitos beach. Very nice place to have a nice view of Pocitos beach and all high buildings, in front of the beach, similar to Copacabana in Brazil. Also interesting place to take nice pictures of all the area. During summer you can go to the",
          "It is a must see for photo's. It's always crowded with eager tourists, so you will have to wait your turn for a good photo.",
          "Few people visiting this location in Montevideo do not stop to take a picture of the big letters and the pretty beach behind the sign. If you go extremely early in the morning, you may miss the crowds and be lucky enough to get a picture without a lot of people doing the same",
          "Not a compulsory visit but if you are around go there and take a picture to register officialy you where in Montevideo. There is a nice view from there.",
          "As a tourist this is a must see destination, just a few minutes to snap a photo and its directly at the sea. If you have time stop in El Kibon for a drink and enjoy the atmosphere.",
          "Famous sign with the backdrop of the beach and skyline. Come first thing in the morning to have the place to yourself. Just beyond is one of the best stretches of the rambla and a good, clean beach.",
          "Almost everyone does. First of all to prove you actually came to Montevideo (not an obvious tourist site), and secondly because its fun.",
          "It feels a bit strange to write a review of a sign, but it is simply so iconic, that it cannot be skipped. Stop by for photos or walk the Rambla to reach the sign. Worth it!",
          "It's just letters spelling the name of the city, so go ahead, take your photos, and move on. Not much else to do or see, but you can at least take a walk on the Rambla, right after. Try not to get bothered with the other tourists doing the exact same thing, and don't expect to",
          "Great views of Montevideo, cool for pics and a nice park. If its a nice day you could even take a picnic",
          "Sign is pretty plain but worth a visit for a fun snap. As it's white it has become a bit dirty so maybe it could do with a clean. Otherwise a great setting for a pic overlooking the beach",
          "the sign was nothing spectacular but it was still a fun stop off on a city tour I took. There's a nice little park there too",
          "Yup, you just have to. \"If a picture paints a thousand words\" take this with your family and post on Facebook. No caption is necessary.",
          "Very good for photos with the beautiful water and buildings in the background. Letters are good for climbing on. Very popular, so you will probably have other people in your pictures.",
          "The Montevideo Sign was one of the first places we visited during our trip and it was worth it! Take a walk on long sidewalks, admire the ocean, then stop and take a picture at the sign (it truly is a wonderful photo opportunity). Fun Fact: The sign often changes colors as it",
          "Located in Beautiful Rambla. We drive and the place is not easy parking. But we talked a municipal guard who kindly allowed us to quickly stop. Much sought after by tourists for photos. The scenery is beautiful.",
          "This stone/concrete sign is near the old entrance to Montevideo years ago.The city is much more spread out now,so you are in town for quite some time before you see it!",
          "My advice is to go there at dusk...just before it gets dark, so you can enjoy the view while there is daylight, and when it gets dark you can see the sign light up in different colors...nice experience",
          "A few years back they put up a multi-coloured Montevideo sign on this spot for a special occasion. It was temporary but proved so popular that they built something more permanent. The current sign is white but often lit up in colour at night. It is beside La Rambla (the",
          "This sign, right alongside a busy highway, does have a nice view of the city in the backround with the water to the left but is mainly used by tourists who pose on or near the sign to memorialize their visit. Unfortunately it isn't that intersting as a sculpture and was covered",
          "The Montevideo sign is located in a very nice part of the city with great views...also close to a couple beaches.",
          "If you have some time to spend after a day on the beach then have a stroll past the sign of Montevideo. It's just next to one of the city many beaches. Besides taking a picture of yourself there's nothing else to do there. The sign is far from the citycenter so it's not worth",
          "Very popular tourist attraction as everyone wants their picture taken here. entire families and they are in no hurry to move on. They painted it all different cultures during a push for diversity and will paint it blue during big soccer games but it is usually just white.",
          "Good place for photos. Nice view from the Rambla. Nothing interesting around though. Just take the photos and leave",
          "Generally is a nice place to visit and take a photo if you have a bit of time as it's not very close to the central part of Montevideo. But there are buses that go there (104 from 18 de julio is one of them). Then you can walk along the beach and enjoy the view. Sadly when I",
          "quite a few small coaches turned up while we were there, so it's becoming a bit of a landmark. we walked quite a few miles along La Rambla to find it, so we were slightly underwhelmed when we got there. the photos fit quite nicely as a header for your facebook page. extra",
          "Tons of people here to take this picture.... there is a beautiful background shot of Montevideo but so many people were there you could not take a picture of the sign without someone you did not know standing in the middle!!!!! (LOL)",
          "Yes it's a bit corny, but you must get a shot at this Montevideo sign and add it to your hand shot. Easy to get to along the Rambla.",
          "If you take the city tour, you'll stop here, because it's a must photo opp. Work with your fellow passengers to take their photos (not a spot for selfies) and ask them to take yours, waiting patiently for everyone else to get out of the picture!",
          "The Montevideo sign, just off the Rambla, is a great little place to have some fun. There are always people, especially travelers, in the little park with the sign. Itis several feet high and made of durable concrete, so climbing on it for photos is expected.",
          "Enjoy a stroll or bike ride on the rambla, and ask a stranger to take a picture of you in front of the sign :)",
          "Visit the Rambla and take your picture in this sign with Pocitos town in the back. Memorable! I visited Montevideo picture!",
          "Just like the hollywood sign you should stop in for an iconic picture if you can. The only trouble is getting a moment when it isn't loaded with people. No one really stops for one photo and goes on their way!",
          "The sign was placed a year ago. If you like selfies, standard pictures, well, this is the place for you. If you want to see the real city, just pass along. Naval Museum, a block away, is much, much better",
          "Love this area and sign. Best thing about it is most of the local buses stop here. Bus terminal across from the sign, so very easy access. Everyone here lined up to take pictures and took photos of each other - really nice as we all got pictures by ourselves. Lovely views",
          "On your trip around the city you will see this quaint sign. You may miss this sign but it is not much to see.",

          "On your way from the airport to the city, along the riverfront, one can't miss the HOLLYWOOD-style huge MONTEVIDEO sign. No way to just drive by. Stop here anytime, but best in the early morning when the sun is lightening up the front of buildings along the rambla and the beach",
          "Could not pass up taking photo at the giant Montevideo sign that greets you as you drive into the city - the background of the coast was a perfect addition to the photo opportunity. Don't miss taking your photo on the way in or out of this fun city!",
          "Nice for a photo shoot, but beyond the clich\u00e9, the scenery and view of montevideo bay and ground are a great place to just relax",
          "I saw this sign on a commercial in BA, and since going to Montevideo wanted to have a photo with it. It is far from the city center in the bay area of Pocitos. Take a taxi. The sign is on the eastern end of the bay and it overlooks it. Beautiful photo spot.",

Described as a \"vibrant, eclectic place with a rich cultural life\", and \"a thriving tech center and entrepreneurial culture\", Montevideo ranked eighth in Latin America on the 2013 MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.In 2014, it was also regarded as the fifth most gay-friendly metropolis in the world and the first in Latin America. It is the hub of commerce and higher education in Uruguay as well as its chief port. The city is also the financial hub of Uruguay and the cultural anchor of a metropolitan area with a population of around 2 million.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are several explanations about the word Montevideo. All agree that \"Monte\" refers to the Cerro de Montevideo, the hill situated across the Bay of Montevideo, but there is disagreement about the etymological origin of the \"video\" part.\n\nMonte vide eu (\"I saw a mount\") is the most widespread belief but is rejected by the majority of experts, who consider it unlikely because it involves a mix of dialects. The name would come from a Portuguese expression which means \"I saw a mount\", wrongly pronounced by an anonymous sailor belonging to the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes on catching sight of the Cerro de Montevideo.\nMonte Vidi: This hypothesis comes from the \"Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n\" (Navigational Calendar) of boatswain Francisco de Albo, member of the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes, who wrote, \"Tuesday of the said [month of January 1520] we were on the straits of Cape Santa Mar\u00eda [now Punta del Este], from where the coast runs east to west, and the terrain is sandy, and at the right of the cape there is a mountain like a hat to which we gave the name \"Montevidi\".\" This is the oldest Spanish document that mentions the promontory with a name similar to the one that designates the city, but it does not contain any mention of the alleged cry \"Monte vide eu.\"\nMonte-VI-D-E-O (Monte VI De Este a Oeste): According to Rolando Laguarda Tr\u00edas, professor of history, the Spaniards annotated the geographic location on a map or Portolan chart, so that the mount/hill is the VI (6th) mount observable on the coast, navigating R\u00edo de la Plata from east to west. With the passing of time, these words were unified to \"Montevideo\". No conclusive evidence has been found to confirm this academic hypothesis nor can it be asserted with certainty which were the other five mounts observable before the Cerro.\nMonte Ovidio (Monte Santo Ovidio), a less widespread hypothesis of a religious origin, stems from an interpolation in the aforementioned Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n of Fernando de Albo, where it is asserted \"corruptly now called Santo Vidio\" when they refer to the hat-like mount which they named Monte Vidi (that is, the Cerro de Montevideo). Ovidio (Saint Ovidius) was the third bishop of the Portuguese city of Braga, where he was always revered; a monument to him was erected there in 1505. Given the relationship that the Portuguese had with the discovery and foundation of Montevideo, and despite the fact that this hypothesis, like the previous ones, lacks conclusive documentation, there have been those who linked the name of Santo Ovidio or Vidio (appearing on some maps of the time) with the subsequent derivation of the name \"Montevideo\" given to the region since the early years of the 16th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBetween 1680 and 1683, Portugal founded the city of Colonia do Sacramento in the region across the bay from Buenos Aires. This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca of Portugal built the Montevieu fort.\nA Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were known as Guanches or Canarians. There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name of Jorge Burgues.A census of the city's inhabitants was performed in 1724 and then a plan was drawn delineating the city and designating it as San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo, later shortened to Montevideo. The census counted fifty families of Galician and Canary Islands origin, more than 1000 indigenous people, mostly Guaran\u00ed, as well as Black African slaves of Bantu origin.A few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the R\u00edo de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River, competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata brought it in confrontations with the city of Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was taken over to be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.\nIn 1776, Spain made Montevideo its main naval base (Real Apostadero de Marina) for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, Fernando Po, and the Falklands.Until the end of the 18th century, Montevideo remained a fortified area, today known as Ciudad Vieja.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nOn 3 February 1807, British troops under the command of General Samuel Auchmuty and Admiral Charles Stirling occupied the city during the Battle of Montevideo (1807), but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the same year on 2 September when John Whitelocke was forced to surrender to troops formed by forces of the Banda Oriental\u2014roughly the same area as modern Uruguay\u2014and of Buenos Aires. After this conflict, the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de El\u00edo opposed the new viceroy Santiago de Liniers, and created a government Junta when the Peninsular War started in Spain, in defiance of Liniers. El\u00edo disestablished the Junta when Liniers was replaced by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros.\nDuring the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo. During that year and the next, Uruguayan revolutionary Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain. In 1811, the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo, which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution. The siege was lifted at the end of that year, when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region.The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814. In 1816, Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821, it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil. It was named Imperial City by Emperor Pedro I when the city was part of the Empire of Brazil as capital of the Cisplatina province. Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the Treinta y Tres Orientales (\"Thirty-Three Orientals\") re-established the independence of the region in 1825. Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828, with Montevideo as the nation's capital. In 1829, the demolition of the city's fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja, referred to as the \"Ciudad Nueva\" (\"new city\"). Urban expansion, however, moved very slowly because of the events that followed.\n\nUruguay's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between Manuel Oribe and Fructuoso Rivera, the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the Empire of Brazil under the command of Lavalleja, each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction. Politics were divided between Oribe's Blancos (\"whites\"), represented by the National Party, and Rivera's Colorados (\"reds\"), represented by the Colorado Party, with each party's name taken from the colour of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the Guerra Grande, which lasted until 1851.\nThe city of Montevideo suffered a siege of eight years between 1843 and 1851, during which it was supplied by sea with British and French support. Oribe, with the support of the then conservative Governor of Buenos Aires Province Juan Manuel de Rosas, besieged the Colorados in Montevideo, where the latter were supported by the French Legion, the Italian Legion, the Basque Legion and battalions from Brazil. Finally, in 1851, with the additional support of Argentine rebels who opposed Rosas, the Colorados defeated Oribe. The fighting, however, resumed in 1855, when the Blancos came to power, which they maintained until 1865. Thereafter, the Colorado Party regained power, which they retained until past the middle of the 20th century.\nAfter the end of hostilities, a period of growth and expansion started for the city. In 1853 a stagecoach bus line was established joining Montevideo with the newly formed settlement of Uni\u00f3n and the first natural gas street lights were inaugurated. From 1854 to 1861 the first public sanitation facilities were constructed. In 1856 the Teatro Sol\u00eds was inaugurated, 15 years after the beginning of its construction. By Decree, in December 1861 the areas of Aguada and Cord\u00f3n were incorporated to the growing Ciudad Nueva (New City). In 1866, an underwater telegraph line connected the city with Buenos Aires. The statue of Peace, La Paz, was erected on a column in Plaza Cagancha and the building of the Postal Service as well as the bridge of Paso Molino were inaugurated in 1867.In 1868, the horse-drawn tram company Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tranv\u00edas al Paso del Molino y Cerro created the first lines connecting Montevideo with Uni\u00f3n, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro, at the time called Cosmopolis. In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras. During the same year and the next, the neighbourhoods Col\u00f3n, Nuevo Par\u00eds and La Comercial were founded. The Sunday market of Trist\u00e1n Narvaja Street was established in Cord\u00f3n in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, Bulevar Circunvalaci\u00f3n was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas, going up to the north end of the city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed to Artigas Boulevard (its current name) in 1885. By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area Los Pocitos was incorporated to the Nov\u00edsima Ciudad (Most New City).The first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas operated ones in 1886. The Hip\u00f3dromo de Maro\u00f1as started operating in 1888, and the neighbourhoods of Reus del Sur, Reus del Norte and Conciliaci\u00f3n were inaugurated in 1889. The new building of the School of Arts and Trades, as well as Zabala Square in Ciudad Vieja were inaugurated in 1890, followed by the Italian Hospital in 1891. In the same year, the village of Pe\u00f1arol was founded. Other neighbourhoods that were founded were Belgrano and Belvedere in 1892, Jacinto Vera in 1895 and Trouville in 1897. In 1894 the new port was constructed, and in 1897, the Central Railway Station of Montevideo was inaugurated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, many Europeans (particularly Spaniards and Italians but also thousands from Central Europe) immigrated to the city. In 1908, 30% of the city's population of 300,000 was foreign-born. In that decade the city expanded quickly: new neighbourhoods were created and many separate settlements were annexed to the city, among which were the Villa del Cerro, Pocitos, the Prado and Villa Col\u00f3n. The Rod\u00f3 Park and the Estadio Gran Parque Central were also established, which served as poles of urban development.During the early 20th century, Uruguay saw huge social changes with repercussions primarily in urban areas. Among these changes were the right of divorce (1907) and women's right to vote.The 1910s saw the construction of Montevideo's Rambla; strikes by tram workers, bakers and port workers; the inauguration of electric trams; the creation of the Municipal Intendencias; and the inauguration of the new port.In 1913, the city limits were extended around the entire gulf. The previously independent localities of the Villa del Cerro and La Teja were annexed to Montevideo, becoming two of its neighborhoods.During the 1920s, the equestrian statue of Artigas was installed in Plaza Independencia; the Palacio Legislativo was built; the Spanish Plus Ultra flying boat arrived (the first airplane to fly from Spain to Latin America, 1926); prominent politician and former president Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez died (1929); and ground was broken (1929) for the Estadio Centenario (completed 1930).During World War II, a famous incident involving the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee took place in Punta del Este, 200 kilometers (120 mi) from Montevideo. After the Battle of the River Plate with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy on 13 December 1939, the Graf Spee retreated to Montevideo's port, which was considered neutral at the time. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on 17 December. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. The eagle figurehead of the Graf Spee was salvaged on 10 February 2006; to protect the feelings of those still sensitive to Nazi Germany, the swastika on the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water.\n\nUruguay began to stagnate economically in the mid-1950s; Montevideo began a decline, later exacerbated by widespread social and political violence beginning in 1968 (including the emergence of the guerrilla Movimiento de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional-Tupamaros) and by the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985). There were major problems with supply; the immigration cycle was reversed.\nFrom the 1960s to the end of the dictatorship in 1985, around one hundred people died or disappeared because of the political violence. From 1974 another hundred Uruguayans disappeared also in Argentina. In 1980, the dictatorship proposed a new constitution. The project was submitted to referendum and rejected in the first polls since 1971, with 58% of the votes against and 42% in favour. The result weakened the military and triggered its fall, allowing the return of democracy.In the 1980s, Pope John Paul II visited the city twice. In April 1987, as head of state of Vatican, he signed a mediation agreement for the conflict of the Beagle Channel. He also held a large mass in Tres Cruces, declaring the cross located behind the altar as a monument. In 1988, he returned to the country, visiting Montevideo, Florida, Salto and Melo.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe 2002 Uruguay banking crisis affected several industries of Montevideo. In 2017, the city has maintained 15 years of economic growth, with a GDP of $44 billion, and a GDP per capita of $25,900.Montevideo has consistently been rated as having the highest quality of life of any city in Latin America: by 2015 it held this rank every year during the decade through 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMontevideo is situated on the north shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata, the arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the south coast of Uruguay from the north coast of Argentina; Buenos Aires lies 230 kilometres (140 mi) west on the Argentine side. The Santa Luc\u00eda River forms a natural border between Montevideo and San Jos\u00e9 Department to its west. To the city's north and east is Canelones Department, with the stream of Carrasco forming the eastern natural border. The coastline forming the city's southern border is interspersed with rocky protrusions and sandy beaches. The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbour, the nation's largest and one of the largest in the Southern Cone, and the finest natural port in the region, functioning as a crucial component of the Uruguayan economy and foreign trade. Various streams criss-cross the town and empty into the Bay of Montevideo. Its coastline near the emptying rivers are heavily polluted.The city has an average elevation of 43 metres (141 ft). Its highest elevations are two hills: the Cerro de Montevideo and the Cerro de la Victoria, with the highest point, the peak of Cerro de Montevideo, crowned by a fortress, the Fortaleza del Cerro at a height of 134 m (440 ft). Closest cities by road are Las Piedras to the north and the so-called Ciudad de la Costa (a conglomeration of coastal towns) to the east, both in the range of 20 to 25 km (16 mi) from the city center. The approximate distances to the neighbouring department capitals by road are, 90 km (56 mi) to San Jose de Mayo (San Jose Department) and 46 km (29 mi) to Canelones (Canelones Department).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontevideo enjoys a humid subtropical climate (Cfa, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). The city has mild winters (June to September), warm-hot summers (December to March) and volatile springs (October and November); there are numerous thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout the year, reaching around 950 millimetres (37 in).Winters are generally cool, wet, windy and overcast. During this season, there are bursts of icy and relatively dry winds of continental polar air masses, giving an unpleasant chilly feeling to the everyday life of the city. Frosts occur few times during winter, generally not falling below 28\u00b0 F (-2\u00b0 C) because of the oceanic influence that moderates the temperature; few miles away from the coast, frosts are more common and colder. Rainfall and sleet are a frequent winter occurrence, but snowfall is extremely rare: flurries have been recorded only four times but with no accumulation, the last one on 13 July 1930 during the inaugural match of the World Cup, (the other three snowfalls were in 1850, 1853 and 1917); the alleged 1980 Carrasco snowfall was actually a hailstorm.Summers are warm-hot and humid, with less wind than other seasons. During this season, a moderate wind often blows from the sea in the evenings which has a pleasant cooling effect on the city, in contrast to the more-severe summer heat of nearby cities like Buenos Aires. Heat waves come with the north winds, which bring humid and hot air masses from the tropical interior of the continent. These warm periods are usually followed by thunderstorms, generated by cold fronts of the southwest that lowers temperatures considerably. This phenomenon is regional, and can occur several times all year long.\nMontevideo has an annual average temperature of 16.7 \u00b0C (62.1 \u00b0F). The lowest recorded temperature is \u22125.6 \u00b0C (21.9 \u00b0F) while the highest is 42.8 \u00b0C (109.0 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions and barrios ===\n\nAs of 2010, the city of Montevideo has been divided into 8 political municipalities (Municipios), referred to with the letters from A to G, including CH, each presided over by a mayor elected by the citizens registered in the constituency. This division, according to the Municipality of Montevideo, \"aims to advance political and administrative decentralization in the department of Montevideo, with the aim of deepening the democratic participation of citizens in governance.\" The head of each Municipio is called an alcalde or (if female) alcaldesa.Of much greater importance is the division of the city into 62 barrios: neighbourhoods or wards. Many of the city's barrios\u2014such as Sayago, Ituzaing\u00f3 and Pocitos\u2014were previously geographically separate settlements, later absorbed by the growth of the city. Others grew up around certain industrial sites, including the salt-curing works of Villa del Cerro and the tanneries in Nuevo Par\u00eds. Each barrio has its own identity, geographic location and socio-cultural activities. A neighbourhood of great significance is Ciudad Vieja, that was surrounded by a protective wall until 1829. This area contains most important buildings of the colonial era and early decades of independence.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n\nThe architecture of Montevideo ranges from Neoclassical buildings such as the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral to the Postmodern style of the World Trade Center Montevideo or the 158-metre (518 ft) ANTEL Telecommunication Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the country. The Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the Palacio Salvo dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building facades in the Old Town reflect the city's extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the Legislative Palace, the City Hall, Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower. The most notable sports stadium is the Estadio Centenario within Parque Batlle. Parque Batlle, Parque Rod\u00f3 and Parque Prado are Montevideo's three great parks.The Pocitos district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the \"Edificio Panamericano\" designed by Raul Sichero, and the \"Positano\" and \"El Pilar\" designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis Garc\u00eda Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighbourhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle class residents.\n\n\n==== Palacio Legislativo ====\n\nThe Palacio Legislativo in Aguada, the north of the city centre, is currently the seat of the Uruguayan Parliament. Construction started in 1904 and was sponsored by the government of President Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. It was designed by Italian architects Vittorio Meano and Gaetano Moretti, who planned the building's interior. Among the notable contributors to the project was sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni, who contributed numerous reliefs and allegorical sculptures.\n\n\n==== World Trade Center Montevideo ====\n\nWorld Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998, but work was completed in 2009. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998. It has 22 floors and 17,100 square metres of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and 27,000 square metres (290,000 sq ft) of space. The 6,300-square-metre (68,000 sq ft) World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a centre of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St. Among the establishments on the plaza are Burger King, Walrus, Bamboo, Asia de Cuba, Gardenia Mvd, and La Claraboya Cafe.\nThe Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social place. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor Pablo Atchugarry. World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and 53,500 square metres (576,000 sq ft) of space is under construction as of 2010.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications Tower ====\n\nTorre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the 158 metres (518 ft), 37-floor headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company, ANTEL, and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect Carlos Ott. It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by American Bridge and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.\nWhen its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40 million, plus US$25 million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65 million price into US$102 million.\n\n\n==== Ciudad Vieja (Old City) ====\n\nCiudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent barrio of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and night-clubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.\n\nMontevideo's most important plaza is Plaza Independencia, located between Ciudad Vieja and downtown Montevideo. It starts with the Gateway of The Citadel at one end and ends at the beginning of 18 de Julio Avenue. It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city. Several notable buildings are located here.  The Sol\u00eds Theatre is Uruguay's oldest theatre. It was built in 1856 and is currently owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theatre, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by Philippe Starck. The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theatre reopened in August of that year. The plaza is also the site of the offices of the President of Uruguay (both the Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower). The Artigas Mausoleum is located at the centre of the plaza. Statues include that of Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, hero of Uruguay's independence movement; an honour guard keeps vigil at the Mausoleum.Palacio Salvo, at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands 100 metres (330 ft) high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confiter\u00eda La Giralda, renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez wrote his tango \"La Cumparsita\" (1917.) Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.Also of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (or Plaza Matriz). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the Cabildo\u2014the seat of colonial government\u2014and the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral. The cathedral is the burial place of Fructuoso Rivera, Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Venancio Flores. Another notable square is Plaza Zabala with the equestrian statue of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On its south side, Palacio Taranco, once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto, another major tourist destination.\n\n\n==== Parque Batlle ====\n\nParque Batlle (formerly: Parque de los Aliados, translation: \"Park of the Allies\") is a major public central park, located south of Avenida Italia and north of Avenue Rivera. Along with Parque Prado and Parque Rod\u00f3 it is one of three large parks that dominate Montevideo. The park and surrounding area constitute one of the 62 neighbourhoods (barrios) of the city. The barrio of Parque Batlle is one of seven coastal barrios, the others being Buceo, Carrasco, Malvin, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, and Punta Gorda. The current barrio of Parque Battle includes four former districts: Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and Batlle Park itself and borders the neighbourhoods of La Blanqueada, Tres Cruces, Pocitos and Buceo. It has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income. Villa Dolores, a subdistrict of Parque Batlle, took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Do\u00f1a Dolores Pereira de Rossel. On their grounds, they started a private collection of animals that became a zoological garden and was passed to the city in 1919; in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises.\n\nParque Batlle is named in honour of Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915. The park was originally proposed by an Act of March 1907, which also projected wide boulevards and avenues. French landscape architect, Carlos Thays, began the plantings in 1911. In 1918, the park was named Parque de los Aliados, following the victory of the Allies of World War I. On 5 May 1930, after significant expansion, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, in memory of the prominent politician and president, who had died in 1929. The park was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975. As of 2010, the park covers an area of 60 hectares (150 acres) and is considered the \"lung\" of the Montevideo city due to the large variety of trees planted here.The Estadio Centenario, the national football stadium, opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, and later hosted several other sporting grounds of note (see Sports).\nIn 1934, sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni's \"La Carreta\", a bronze monument on granite base, was installed on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario. One of several statues in the park, it depicts yoked oxen pulling a loaded wagon. It was designated a national monument in 1976. Another statue on the same side of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron.\nOn the west side of Parque Batlle, on Artigas Boulevard, the 1938 Obelisk of Montevideo is a monument dedicated to those who created the first Constitution. The work of sculptor Jos\u00e9 Luis Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn (1891\u20131975), it is a three-sided granite obelisk, 40 metres (130 ft) tall, with bronze statues on its three sides, representing \"Law\", \"Liberty\", and \"Force\", respectively. It has been a National Heritage Site since 1976.\n\n\n==== Parque Prado ====\n\nEstablished in 1873, the largest of Montevideo's six main public parks is the 1.06-square-kilometre (260-acre) Parque Prado. Located in the northern part of the city, the Miguelete Creek flows through the park and the neighbourhood and of the same name. It is surrounded by the avenues Agraciada, Obes Lucas, Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez, Luis Alberto de Herrera and by the streets Castro and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyes.\nThe most frequented areas of the park are the Rosedal, a public rose garden with pergolas, the Botanical Garden, the area around the Hotel del Prado, as well as the Rural del Prado, a seasonal cattle and farm animal fairground. The Rosedal contains four pergolas, eight domes, and a fountain; its 12,000 roses were imported from France in 1910. There are several jogging paths along the Miguelete river.\nThe Presidential Residence is located behind the Botanical Gardens. Established in 1930, Juan Manuel Blanes Museum is situated in the Palladian villa, a National Heritage Site since 1975, and includes a Japanese garden. The Professor Atilio Lombardo Museum and Botanical Gardens were established in 1902. The National Institute of Physical Climatology and its observatory are also in the Prado.\n\n\n==== Parque Rod\u00f3 ====\n\nParque Rod\u00f3 is both a barrio (neighbourhood) of Montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighbourhood itself and belongs to Punta Carretas. The name \"Rod\u00f3\" commemorates Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, an important Uruguayan writer whose monument is in the southern side of the main park. The park was conceived as a French-style city park. Apart from the main park area which is delimited by Sarmiento Avenue to the south, Parque Rod\u00f3 includes an amusement park; the Estadio Luis Franzini, belonging to Defensor Sporting; the front lawn of the Faculty of Engineering and a strip west of the Club de Golf de Punta Carretas that includes the Canteras (\"quarry\") del Parque Rod\u00f3, the Teatro de Verano (\"summer theatre\") and the Lago (\"lake\") del Parque Rod\u00f3.On the east side of the main park area is the National Museum of Visual Arts. On this side, a street market takes place every Sunday. On the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children. An area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography. West of the park, across the coastal avenue Rambla Presidente Wilson, stretches Ramirez Beach. Directly west of the main park are, and belonging to Parque Rod\u00f3 barrio, is the former Parque Hotel, now called Edif\u00edcio Mercosur, seat of the parliament of the members countries of the Mercosur. During the guerilla war the Tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area, including the old hotel.\n\n\n==== Forts ====\nThe first set of subsidiary forts were planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at Colonia del Sacramento. However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship Nossa Senhora de Oliveara. They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.\n\n\n===== Fortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro) =====\n\nFortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839. It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931 and has housed a military museum since 1916. Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.\n\n\n==== Punta Brava Lighthouse ====\n\nPunta Brava Lighthouse (Faro Punta Brava), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876. The lighthouse is 21 metres (69 ft) high and its light reaches 24 km (15 mi) away, with a flash every ten seconds. In 1962, the lighthouse became electric. The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Ingl\u00e9s Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Luc\u00eda River.\n\n\n==== Rambla of Montevideo ====\n\nThe Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word rambla is \"avenue\" or \"watercourse\", but in the Americas it is mostly used as \"coastal avenue\", and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the R\u00edo de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas (\"United Nations\"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.\n\nThe Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even\u2014in a special area\u2014skateboard. Its 27-kilometre (17 mi) length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.Montevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city. Its best known beaches are Ram\u00edrez, Pocitos, Carrasco, Buceo and Malv\u00edn. Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.\n\n\n==== Cemeteries ====\n\nThere are five large cemeteries in Montevideo, all administered by the \"F\u00fanebre y Necr\u00f3polis\" annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Juan Manuel Blanes, Fran\u00e7ois Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont (Isidore Ducasse), Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, and Juan Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn.\nThe other large cemeteries are the Cementerio del Buceo, Cementerio del Cerro, and Cementerio Paso Molino.\nThe British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Brit\u00e1nico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighborhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Mr. Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors, contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine, Henry de Costa, is buried here.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nIn 1860, Montevideo had 57,913 inhabitants including a number of people of African origin who had been brought as slaves and had gained their freedom around the middle of the century. By 1880, the population had quadrupled, mainly because of the great European immigration. In 1908, its population had grown massively to 309,331 inhabitants. In the course of the 20th century the city continued to receive large numbers of European immigrants, especially Spanish and Italian, followed by French, Germans, English, Irish, Swiss, Austrians, Poles, Dutch, Greek, Hungarians, Russians, Croats, Lebanese, Armenians, and Jews of various origins. The last wave of immigrants occurred between 1945 and 1955.According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay's total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of \u22121.5 per thousand. Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975\u20131985, which showed a rate of \u22125.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004. However, mortality continued to fall with life expectancy at birth for both sexes increasing by 1.73 years.In the census of 2011, Montevideo had a population of 1,319,108.\nSource: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica de Uruguay\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Intendencia de Montevideo ===\n\nThe Municipality of Montevideo was first created by a legal act of 18 December 1908. The municipality's first mayor (1909\u20131911) was Daniel Mu\u00f1oz. Municipalities were abolished by the Uruguayan Constitution of 1918, effectively restored during the 1933 military coup of Gabriel Terra, and formally restored by the 1934 Constitution. The 1952 Constitution again decided to abolish the municipalities; it came into effect in February 1955. Municipalities were replaced by departmental councils, which consisted of a collegiate executive board with 7 members from Montevideo and 5 from the interior region. However, municipalities were revived under the 1967 Constitution and have operated continuously since that time.\nSince 1990, Montevideo has been partially decentralized into 18 areas; administration and services for each area is provided by its Zonal Community Center (Centro Comunal Zonal, CCZ), which is subordinate to the Municipality of Montevideo. The boundaries of the municipal districts of Montevideo were created on 12 July 1993, and successively amended on 19 October 1993, 6 June 1994 and 10 November 1994.\nThe city government of Montevideo performs several functions, including maintaining communications with the public, promoting culture, organizing society, caring for the environment and regulating traffic. Its headquarters is the Palacio Municipal on 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro area of Montevideo.Another body, the Junta Departamental, or the Congress of Montevideo, governs the Department of Montevideo. The Junta, composed of 31 unsalaried elected members, is responsible for such things as the freedom of the citizens, the regulation of cultural activities, the naming of streets and public places, and the placement of monuments; it also responds to proposals of the Intendant in various circumstances. Its seat is the architecturally remarkable Casa de Francisco G\u00f3mez in Ciudad Vieja.A 2016 private ranking named Subnational Legislative Online Opening Index measured the data availability in official websites, scoring Montevideo as the second most open district nationally at 17.50 points.\n\n\n=== Intendants of Montevideo ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn recent years Montevideo nightlife has moved to Parque Rod\u00f3, where a large concentration of buildings cater for the recreational interests of young people during the night time. Under a presidential decree of 1 March 2006 smoking is prohibited in any public place with roofing, and there is a prohibition on the sale of alcohol in certain businesses from 21.00 to 9.00.Montevideo has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Literature since December 2015.\n\n\n=== The arts ===\nMontevideo has a very rich architectural heritage and an impressive number of writers, artists, and musicians. Uruguayan tango is a unique form of dance that originated in the neighbourhoods of Montevideo towards the end of the 1800s. Tango, candombe and murga are the three main styles of music in this city. The city is also the centre of the cinema of Uruguay, which includes commercial, documentary and experimental films. There are two movie theatre companies running seven cinemas, around ten independent ones and four art film cinemas in the city. The theatre of Uruguay is admired inside and outside Uruguayan borders. The Sol\u00eds Theatre is the most prominent theatre in Uruguay and the oldest in South America. There are several notable theatrical companies and thousands of professional actors and amateurs. Montevideo playwrights produce dozens of works each year; of major note are Mauricio Rosencof, Ana Magnabosco and Ricardo Prieto. \n\n\n==== Visual arts ====\n\nThe daily newspaper El Pa\u00eds sponsors the Virtual Museum of contemporary Uruguayan art. The director and curator of the Museum presents exhibitions in \"virtual spaces, supplemented by information, biographies, texts in English and Spanish\".In the early 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo, one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a \"hotbed of resistance\". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nThe first public library in Montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of Father Jos\u00e9 Manuel P\u00e9rez Castellano, who died in 1815. Its promoter, director and organizer was Father D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga, who also made a considerable donation along with donations from Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Guerra, as well as others from the Convent of San Francisco in Salta. In 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes. The current building of the National Library of Uruguay (Biblioteca P\u00fablica de Uruguay) was designed by Luis Crespi in the Neoclassical style and occupies an area of 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). Construction began in 1926 and it was finally inaugurated in 1964. Its current collection amounts to roughly 900,000 volumes.\n\n\n===== Authors =====\n\nThe city has a long and rich literary tradition. Although Uruguayan literature is not limited to the authors of the capital (Horacio Quiroga was born in Salto and Mario Benedetti in Paso de los Toros, for instance), Montevideo has been and is the centre of the editorial and creative activity of literature.\nIn 1900, the city had a remarkable group of writers, including Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Julio Herrera y Reissig, Delmira Agustini and Felisberto Hern\u00e1ndez. Montevideo was then called the \"Atenas del Plata\" or the \"Athens of the Rio de la Plata\".\n\nAmong the outstanding authors of Montevideo of the second half of the 20th century are Juan Carlos Onetti, Antonio Larreta, Eduardo Galeano, Marosa di Giorgio and Cristina Peri Rossi.A new generation of writers have become known internationally in recent years. These include Eduardo Espina (essayist and poet), Fernando Butazzoni (novelist), Rafael Courtoisie (poet) and Hugo Burel (short story writer and novelist).\n\n\n==== Music ====\nIn Montevideo, as throughout the Rio de Plata region, the most popular forms of music are tango, milonga and vals criollo. Many notable songs originated in Montevideo including \"El Tango supremo\", La Cumparsita\", La Milonga\", \"La Pu\u00f1alada\" and \"Desde el Alma\", composed by notable Montevideo musicians such as Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez, Pint\u00edn Castellanos and Rosita Melo. Tango is deeply ingrained in the cultural life of the city and is the theme for many of the bars and restaurants in the city. Fun Fun' Bar, established in 1935, is one of the most important places for tango in Uruguay as is El Farolito, located in the old part of the city and Joventango, Caf\u00e9 Las Musas, Garufa and Vieja Viola. The city is also home to the Montevideo Jazz Festival and has the Bancaria Jazz Club bar catering for jazz enthusiasts.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe center of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto (\"Port Market\"). Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. A torta frita is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the centre for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt. Montevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Recreation ===\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nA Cultural Centre of Spain, as well as Asturian and cultural centres, testify to Montevideo's considerable Spanish heritage. Montevideo also has important museums including Museo Torres Garc\u00eda, Museo Jos\u00e9 Gurvich, Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales and Museo Juan Manuel Blanes etc.\nThe Montevideo Cabildo was the seat of government during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata. It is located in front of Constitution Square, in Ciudad Vieja. Built between 1804 and 1869 in Neoclassical style, with a series of Doric and Ionic columns, it became a National Heritage Site in 1975. In 1958, the Municipal Historic Museum and Archive was inaugurated here. It features three permanent city museum exhibitions, as well as temporary art exhibitions, cultural events, seminars, symposiums and forums.\n\nThe Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo's first theatre (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules-L\u00e9on Chifflot who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site. The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts, ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th\u201318th century from the area of present-day Iran. The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government.\n\nThe National History Museum of Montevideo is located in the historical residence of General Fructuoso Rivera. It exhibits artifacts related to the history of Uruguay. In a process begun in 1998, the National Museum of Natural History (1837) and the National Museum of Anthropology (1981), merged in 2001, becoming the National Museum of Natural History and Anthropology. In July 2009, the two institutions again became independent. The Historical Museum has annexed eight historical houses in the city, five of which are located in the Ciudad Vieja. One of them, on the same block with the main building, is the historic residence of Antonio Montero, which houses the Museo Romantico.\n\nThe Museo Torres Garc\u00eda is located in the Old Town, and exhibits Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda's unusual portraits of historical icons and cubist paintings akin to those of Picasso and Braque. The museum was established by Manolita Pi\u00f1a Torres, the widow of Torres Garcia, after his death in 1949. She also set up the Garc\u00eda Torres Foundation, a private non-profit organization that organizes the paintings, drawings, original writings, archives, objects and furniture designed by the painter as well as the photographs, magazines and publications related to him.\n\nThere are several other important art museums in Montevideo. The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rod\u00f3 has Uruguay's largest collection of paintings. The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930, the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay, significant with regard to the fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes. In back of the museum is a Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp. The Museo de Historia del Arte, located in the Palacio Municipal, features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period. The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial, in the Ciudad Vieja, has preserved collections of the archaeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archaeologist Antonio Taddei. These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America, painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Museo de Arte Contempo has small but impressive exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture.There are also other types of museums in the city. The Museo del Gaucho y de la Moneda, located in the Centro, has distinctive displays of the historical culture of Uruguay's gauchos, their horse gear, silver work and mate (tea), gourds, and bombillas (drinking straws) in odd designs. The Museo Naval, is located on the eastern waterfront in Buceo and offers exhibits depicting the maritime history of Uruguay. The Museo del Autom\u00f3vil, belonging to the Automobile Club of Uruguay, has a rich collection of vintage cars which includes a 1910 Hupmobile. The Museo y Parque Fernando Garc\u00eda in Carrasco, a transport and automobile museum, includes old horse carriages and some early automobiles. The Castillo Pittamiglio, with an unusual fa\u00e7ade, highlights the eccentric legacy of Humberto Pittamiglio, local alchemist and architect.\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\n\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is home to a number of festivals and carnivals including a Gaucho festival when people ride through the streets on horseback in traditional gaucho gear. The major annual festival is the annual Montevideo Carnival which is part of the national festival of Carnival Week, celebrated throughout Uruguay, with central activities in the capital, Montevideo. Officially, the public holiday lasts for two days on Carnival Monday and Shrove Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, but due to the prominence of the festival, most shops and businesses close for the entire week.\nDuring carnival there are many open-air stage performances and competitions and the streets and houses are vibrantly decorated. \"Tablados\" or popular scenes, both fixed and movable, are erected in the whole city. Notable displays include \"Desfile de las Llamadas\" (\"Parade of the Calls\"), which is a grand united parade held on the south part of downtown, where it used to be a common ritual back in the early 20th century. Due to the scale of the festival, preparation begins as early as December with an election of the \"zonal beauty queens\" to appear in the carnival.\n\n\n==== Sports ====\n\nEstadio Centenario, the national football stadium in Parque Batlle, was opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay's first constitution. In this World Cup, Uruguay won the title game against Argentina by 4 goals to 2. The stadium has 70,000 seats. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums, along with Maracan\u00e3, Wembley Stadium, San Siro, Estadio Azteca, and Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. A museum located within the football stadium has exhibits of memorabilia from Uruguay's 1930 and 1950 World Cup championships. Museum tickets give access to the stadium, stands, locker rooms and playing field.Between 1935 and 1938, the athletics track and the municipal velodrome were completed within Parque Batlle. The Tabar\u00e9 Athletic Club is occasionally made over as a carnival theatre using impermanent materials.\n\nToday the vast majority of teams in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n come from Montevideo, including Nacional, Pe\u00f1arol, Central Espa\u00f1ol, Cerrito, Cerro, Danubio, Defensor Sporting, Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9nix, Liverpool, Wanderers, Racing, River Plate, Club Atl\u00e9tico Torque and Rampla Juniors.\nBesides Estadio Centenario, other stadiums include Estadio Campeon del Siglo, Pe\u00f1arol, Gran Parque Central, Belvedere, Complejo Rentistas, Jardines del Hip\u00f3dromo, Jos\u00e9 Pedro Damiani, \"La Bombonera\", Luis Franzini, Luis Tr\u00f3ccoli and the park stadiums of Abraham Paladino, Alfredo V\u00edctor Viera, Omar Saroldi, Jos\u00e9 Nasazzi, Osvaldo Roberto, Maracan\u00e1 and Palermo.\nThe city has a tradition as host of major international basketball tournaments including the official 1967 FIBA World Cup and the 1988 1997 and 2017 editions of the official Americas Basketball Championship.\nThe Uruguayan Basketball League is headquartered in Montevideo and most of its teams are from the city, including Defensor Sporting, Bigu\u00e1, Aguada, Goes, Malv\u00edn, Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tica, and Trouville. Montevideo is also a centre of rugby; equestrianism, which regained importance in Montevideo after the Maro\u00f1as Racecourse reopened; golf, with the Club de Punta Carretas; and yachting, with the Puerto del Buceo, an ideal place to moor yachts. The Golf Club of Punta Carretas was founded in 1894 covers all the area encircled by the west side of Bulevar Artigas, the Rambla (Montevideo's promenade) and the Parque Rod\u00f3 (Fun Fair).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChurch and state are officially separated since 1916 in Uruguay. The religion with most followers in Montevideo is Roman Catholicism and has been so since the foundation of the city. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montevideo was created as the Apostolic Vicariate of Montevideo in 1830. The vicariate was promoted to the Diocese of Montevideo on 13 July 1878. Pope Leo XIII elevated it to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese on 14 April 1897. The new archdiocese became the Metropolitan of the suffragan sees of Canelones, Florida, Maldonado\u2013Punta del Este, Melo, Mercedes, Minas, Salto, San Jos\u00e9 de Mayo, Tacuaremb\u00f3.\nMontevideo is the only archdiocese in Uruguay and, as its Ordinary, the archbishop is also Primate of the Catholic Church in Uruguay. The archdiocese's mother church and thus seat of its archbishop is Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n y San Felipe y Santiago. As of 2010, the current Archbishop of Montevideo is Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet, SDB, since his appointment on 11 February 2014.Other religious faiths in Montevideo are Protestantism, Umbanda, Judaism, and there are many people who define themselves as Atheists and Agnostics, while others profess \"believing in God but without religion\".\n\n\n==== Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral ====\n\nThe Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Roman Catholic church of Montevideo. It is located in Ciudad Vieja, immediately across Constitution Square from the Cabildo. In 1740 a brick church was built on the site. In 1790, the foundation was laid for the current neoclassical structure. The church was consecrated in 1804. Bicentennial celebrations were held in 2004.\nIn 1897, Pope Leo XIII elevated the church to Metropolitan Cathedral status. Important ceremonies are conducted under the direction of the Archbishop of Montevideo. Weddings and choral concerts are held here and the parish priest conducts the routine functions of the cathedral. In the 19th century, its precincts were also used as a burial place of famous people who died in the city. For decades, the prison and the nearby Punta Carretas parish church were the only major buildings in the neighbourhood.\n\n\n==== Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n ====\n\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (\"Our Lady of the Sacred Heart\"), also known as Iglesia Punta Carretas (\"Punta Carretas Church\"), was built between 1917 and 1927 in the Romanesque Revival style. The church was originally part of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, but is presently in the parish of the Ecclesiastic Curia. Its location is at the corner of Solano Garc\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 Ellauri. It has a nave and aisles. The roof has many vaults. During the construction of the Punta Carretas Shopping complex, major cracks developed in the structure of the church as a result of differential foundation settlement.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is the economic and political centre of the country. Most of the largest and wealthiest businesses in Uruguay have their headquarters in the city. Since the 1990s the city has undergone rapid economic development and modernization, including two of Uruguay's most important buildings\u2014the World Trade Center Montevideo (1998), and Telecommunications Tower (2000), the headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company ANTEL, increasing the city's integration into the global marketplace.The Port of Montevideo, in the northern part of Ciudad Vieja, is one of the major ports of South America and plays a very important role in the city's economy. The port has been growing rapidly and consistently at an average annual rate of 14 percent due to an increase in foreign trade. The city has received a US$20 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to modernize the port, increase its size and efficiency, and enable lower maritime and river transportation costs.The most important state-owned companies headquartered in Montevideo are: AFE (railways), ANCAP (Energy), Administracion Nacional de Puertos (Ports), ANTEL (telecommunications), BHU (savings and loan), BROU (bank), BSE (insurance), OSE (water & sewage), UTE (electricity). These companies operate under public law, using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called Ente Autonomo (\"autonomous entity\"). The government also owns part of other companies operating under private law, such as those owned wholly or partially by the CND (National Development Corporation).\nBanking has traditionally been one of the strongest service export sectors in Uruguay: the country was once dubbed \"the Switzerland of America\", mainly for its banking sector and stability, although that stability has been threatened in the 21st century by the recent global economic climate. The largest bank in Uruguay is Banco Republica (BROU), based in Montevideo. Almost 20 private banks, most of them branches of international banks, operate in the country (Banco Santander, BBVA, ABN AMRO, Citibank, among others). There are also a myriad of brokers and financial-services bureaus, among them Ficus Capital, Galfin Sociedad de Bolsa, Europa Sociedad de Bolsa, Dar\u00edo Cukier, GBU, Horde\u00f1ana & Asociados Sociedad de Bolsa, etc.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism accounts for much of Uruguay's economy. Tourism in Montevideo is centered in the Ciudad Vieja area, which includes the city's oldest buildings, several museums, art galleries, and nightclubs, with Sarand\u00ed Street and the Mercado del Puerto being the most frequented venues of the old city. On the edge of Ciudad Vieja, Plaza Independencia is surrounded by many sights, including the Sol\u00eds Theatre and the Palacio Salvo; the plaza also constitutes one end of 18 de Julio Avenue, the city's most important tourist destination outside of Ciudad Vieja. Apart from being a shopping street, the avenue is noted for its Art Deco buildings, three important public squares, the Gaucho Museum, the Palacio Municipal and many other sights. The avenue leads to the Obelisk of Montevideo; beyond that is Parque Batlle, which along with the Parque Prado is another important tourist destination. Along the coast, the Fortaleza del Cerro, the Rambla (the coastal avenue), 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) of sandy beaches, and Punta Gorda attract many tourists, as do the Barrio Sur and Palermo barrios.The Ministry of Tourism offers a two-and-a-half-hour city tour and the Montevideo Tourist Guide Association offers guided tours in English, Italian, Portuguese and German. Apart from these, many private companies offer organized city tours.\nMost tourists to the city come from Argentina, Brazil and Europe, with the number of visitors from elsewhere in Latin America and from the United States growing every year, thanks to an increasing number of international airline arrivals at Carrasco International Airport as well as cruises that arrive into the port of Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\nMontevideo has over 50 hotels, mostly located in the city centre or along the beachfront of the Rambla de Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nMontevideo is the heartland of retailing in Uruguay. The city has become the principal centre of business and real estate, including many expensive buildings and modern towers for residences and offices, surrounded by extensive green spaces. In 1985, the first shopping centre in Rio de la Plata, Montevideo Shopping was built. In 1994, with building of three more shopping complexes such as the Shopping Tres Cruces, Portones Shopping, and Punta Carretas Shopping, the business map of the city changed dramatically. The creation of shopping complexes brought a major change in the habits of the people of Montevideo. Global firms such as McDonald's and Burger King etc. are firmly established in Montevideo.\nApart from the big shopping complexes, the main retailing venues of the city are: most of 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro and Cord\u00f3n barrios, a length of Agraciada Avenue in the Paso de Molino area of Belvedere, a length of Arenal Grande St. and the\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nOut of the 100 radio stations found in Uruguay, 40 of them are in Montevideo. The city has a vibrant artistic and literary community. The press enjoyed full freedom until the advent of the Civic-military dictatorship (1973\u20131985); this freedom returned on 1 March 1985, as part of the restoration of democracy.\nSome of the important newspapers published in the city are: Brecha, La Republica, El Observador, El Pa\u00eds, Gaceta Comercial and La Diaria. El D\u00eda was the most prestigious paper in Uruguay, founded in 1886 by Jos\u00e9 Batlle, who would later go on to become President of Uruguay. The paper ceased production in the early 1990s. All television stations have their headquarters in Montevideo, for example: Saeta Channel 10, Teledoce, Channel 4 and National Television (Channel 5)\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte (DNT), part of the national Ministry of Transport and Public Works, is responsible for the organization and development of Montevideo's transport infrastructure. A bus service network covers the entire city. An international bus station, the Tres Cruces Bus Station, is located on the lower level of the Tres Cruces Shopping Center, on the side of Artigas Boulevard. This terminal, along with the Baltazar Brum Bus Terminal (or Rio Branco Terminal) by the Port of Montevideo, handles the long distance and intercity bus routes connecting to destinations within Uruguay.\n\nThe State Railways Administration of Uruguay (AFE) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the Empalme Olmos, San Jose and Florida. These lines operate to major suburban areas of Canelones, San Jos\u00e9 and Florida. Within the Montevideo city limits, local trains stop at Lorenzo Carnelli, Yatai (Step Mill), Sayago, Columbus (line to San Jose and Florida), Pe\u00f1arol and Manga (line Empalme Olmos) stations. The historic 19th century General Artigas Central Station located in the neighbourhood of Aguada, six blocks from the central business district, was abandoned 1 March 2003 and remains closed. A new station, 500 metres (1,600 ft) north of the old one and part of the Tower of Communications modern complex, has taken over the rail traffic.Carrasco International Airport (IATA: MVD, ICAO: SUMU), which serves Montevideo, is located 19 km (12 mi) from the city centre. Several international airlines operate there. The airport serves over 1,500,000 passengers annually. \u00c1ngel S. Adami Airport is a private airport operated by minor charter companies.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Montevideo, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 65 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 18% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.2 km, while 6% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nThe port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbour entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of R\u00edo de la Plata, Buenos Aires.\nThe main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, until the 21st century, physical changes had ceased, and since that time the area had degraded due to national economic stagnation.The port's proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.Every year more than one hundred cruises arrive, bringing tourists to Montevideo by public or private tours.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Public education ===\nThe University of the Republic is the country's largest and most important university, with a student body of 81,774, according to the census of 2007. It was founded on 18 July 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its current Rector is Dr. Rodrigo Arocena. The university houses 14 faculties (departments) and various institutes and schools. Many eminent Uruguayans have graduated from this university, including Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Jos\u00e9 Luis Massera, Gabriel Paternain, Mario Wschebor, Roman Fresnedo Siri, Carlos Ott and Eladio Dieste\nThe process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time.\n\n\n=== Private education ===\nThe largest private university in Uruguay, is also located in Montevideo. ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942, and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996, becoming the second private educational institution in the country to achieve that status. It is a member of World ORT, an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nThe university has about 8,000 students, distributed among 5 faculties and institutes, mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering. Its current rector as of 2010 is Dr. Jorge A. Gr\u00fcnberg.\nThe Montevideo Crandon Institute is an American School of missionary origin and the main Methodist educational institution in Uruguay. Founded in 1879 and supported by the Women's Society of the Methodist Church of the United States, it is one of the most traditional and emblematic institutions in the city inculcating John Wesley's values. Its alumni include presidents, senators, ambassadors and Nobel Prize winners, along with musicians, scientists, and others. The Montevideo Crandon Institute boasts of being the first academic institution in South America where a home economics course was taught.\n\nThe Christian Brothers of Ireland Stella Maris College is a private, co-educational, not-for-profit Catholic school located in the wealthy residential southeastern neighbourhood of Carrasco. Established in 1955, it is regarded as one of the best high schools in the country, blending a rigorous curriculum with strong extracurricular activities. The school's headmaster, history professor Juan Pedro Toni, is a member of the Stella Maris Board of Governors and the school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Its long list of distinguished former pupils includes economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school's alumni club.\nAlso in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo, one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, founded in 1908 with \"the object of giving children a complete education, both intellectual and moral, based upon the ideas and principles of the best schools in The British Isles\".\nThe School is governed by the Board of Governors, elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay, whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay. Prominent alumni include former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry Herr\u00e1n and Gabriel Gurm\u00e9ndez Armand-Ugon.\nLocated in Cordon, St.Brendan's school, previously named St.Catherine's is a non-profit civil association, which has a solid institutional culture with a clear vision of the future. It is knowned for being one of the best schools in the country, joining students from the wealthiest parts of Montevideo, such us, Punta Carretas, Pocitos, Malvin and Carrasco.\nSt. Brendan's School is a bilingual, non-denominational school that promotes a pedagogical constructivist approach focused on the child as a whole. In this approach, understanding is built from the connections children make between their own prior knowledge and the learning experiences, thus developing critical thinking skills. It is also the only school in the country implementing the three International Baccalaureate Programmes. These are:\n\nDiploma Programme \u2013 Pre-University course for students aged 16 to 19. The Diploma Programme is a two-year curriculum.\nMYP -Middle Years Programme. For students aged 12 to 16.\nPYP \u2013 Primary Years Programme. For students aged 3 to 12.Other educational institutions of note include Colegio Ingles, Instituto Preuniversitario Salesiano Juan XXIII, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Montevideo, Ivy Thomas, German School of Montevideo and Colegio Preuniversitario Ciudad de San Felipe.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nIn Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by polyclinics and hospitals or sanatorios. The term hospital is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while sanatorio is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.\n\n\n=== Public hospitals ===\nHospital de Cl\u00ednicas \"Dr. Manuel Quintela\" is a University Hospital attached to the University of the Republic, and is located on Avenida Italia. It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928\u20131929 and has a surface area of 110,000 square metres (1,200,000 sq ft) on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr. Hugo Villar, who was a considerable influence on the institution.\nHospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaran\u00ed and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of Jos\u00e9 Toribio (son of Tom\u00e1s Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaran\u00ed street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaran\u00ed and 25 de Mayo) and Juli\u00e1n Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Est\u00e9vez in 1798.Hospital Pereira Rossell was founded in 1908 and was built on land donated in late 1900 by Alexis Rossell y Rius and Dolores Pereira de Rossell. It was the city's first pediatric hospital, and shortly afterwards the addition of an obstetric and gynaecological clinic in 1915 made it the first maternity hospital as well. Later, the hospital received a donation from Dr. Enrique Pouey for a radiotherapy unit.\nHospital Vilardeb\u00f3 is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist Teodoro Vilardeb\u00f3 Matuliche, it opened 21 May 1880. The hospital was originally one of the best of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel. It has an emergency service, outpatient, clinic and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others. The average patient age is 30 years; more than half of the patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.\nOther public polyclinics and hospitals of note include the Hospital Saint Bois, founded 18 November 1928, which consists of a General Hospital and Eye Hospital; the Pasteur Hospital in La Uni\u00f3n neighbourhood; the Hospital Espa\u00f1ol, which was founded in 1886, passed to the private sector in the 20th century, closed in 2004 and was restored and reinaugurated in 2007 as the municipal Juan Jose Crottogini Polyclinic; the National Cancer Institute; and the National Institute of Trauma and Orthopedics.\n\n\n=== Private healthcare ===\nPrivate healthcare is offered by many private health insurance companies, each of which has one or more polyclinics and owns or is associated with one or more hospitals. Private medical facilities of note include the Hospital Brit\u00e1nico, the Italian Hospital of Montevideo, Mutualista CASMU's Sanatoria I, II, III and IV, the Evangelical Hospital, M\u00e9dica Uruguaya, Sanatorio de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, Sanatorios del C\u00edrculo Cat\u00f3lico, Sanatorio Casa de Galicia and Sanatorio GREMCA.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nMontevideo is twinned with:\n\nMontevideo is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities since 12 October 1982.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nAlbes, Edward.

          "It is wonderful to see that this magical place, unique un Uruguay, has been recovered. The museum and a walk through the castle grounds, take us back to an era thet we should not forget. After visiting the museum and going through the mysterious gardens, we enjoyed a nice coffee",
          "There isn't a lot known about the building or about Humberto Pittamiglio. The building's architecture and decorations are filled with meaning, however the building was oppressive. The outside of the building that you can see from the street is very cool.",
          "We say that Pitamiglio was an Alchemist of 4th degree. The conception and the constructionof the castle wre made under his inspiration. Some legends let know that during the 2nd world war the Saint Graal was recovered in Montecasino in Italy and translated to the Pittamiglio",
          "Fascinating architectural gem created by a true eccentric. Unfortunately, the tour was offered only in Spanish and though we had a Spanish speaker in our group translating on the fly, I'm sure we missed a lot of the explanation. Still, it was worth the experience.",
          "Pittamiglio was an engineer, architect and alchemist. 54 rooms, 33 doors and many stairs. It is a labyrinth of 14,000sq ft spread over many levels. Tours are available in English and it is not wheelchair friendly.",
          "This place is thought to be inhabited by ghosts and spirits. We were also told that Pope John Paul visited this house for three hours on his last visit leading to much speculation.",
          "I liked the visit. Remember that there is only one tour per day at 5:00 pm so you need to plan accordingly.",
          "If you are walking or driving along the Rambla in Punta Carretas and Pocitos, you can't miss this odd, eccentric building with a reproduction of the Winged Victory of Samothrace projecting out as if from the prow of a ship. The castle was built by Pittamiglio in the early",
          "Simply average. Nothing life-changingly interesting here. I can see where some people would be impressed with it's history, but I found it to be just, okay, when compared to the other attractions in the city. If you skip this place, it would be okay.",
          "This was part of a tour of the city and it was an interesting part of the city's history. The house design both interior and exterior are worth seeing. At the end we were treated to watching a couple tango. Many of us got to participate.",
          "This was part of a larger tour of Montevideo and quite honestly is just an average attraction. Not really into alchemy and in some places the castle is somewhat run down. We were supposed to see a tango show but saw only one tango instructor who taught the audience a few dance",
          "Next to the Pocitos beach lies the Castillo Pittamiglio (Pittamiglio Castle). From the city centre you can take a taxi to there (Uber costs around 200 pesos or US$ 7) The tour lasts around 40 minutes. The guide explains about the life of Humberto Pittamiglio (the owner) and",
          "Walking on the Ramblas we saw this strange looking building and decided to go in. The castle was actually quite large and there are daily tours starting at 10 am. The guide spoke some English put we did the tour in Spanish. Every room and there are lots is different in size,",
          "This tour was approximately 4 1/2 hours and included a city tour and tango demonstration. The city itself is nothing particularly interesting or worth the time. The castle was nice and the highlight was the tango demonstrations by very skilled dancers. However it was not",
          "Mostly every day, it is able to visit inside the building, with a special guide, which will explain, the constructure of each room, since all of them are different. All is very interesting. There is also a nice Restaurant with the posibility to have a good dinner.",
          "We went there hoping to see a historic place and learn a little bit from it but unfortunately the guide was not there and they allowed us to visit unguided. The architecture was really interesting but the conservation state of the building is terrible and clearly decadent.",
          "Tour at 5:00pm certain days of the week (I went on Tuesday), lasted about 40 minutes. Well worth cost of admission (130 Uruguayan pesos). It was hard to find information ahead of time about tour availability - we went early and there was a note on the door with the schedule. All",
          "We are particularly fond of the unusual and off of the beaten track, so this place was a delight for us. It would have been better if we were Spanish speakers, since the tour isn't offered in English, but our guide was very nice to give us abbreviated English translations and",
          "I lived many years in 21 de Setiembre and we were very curious about this castle. They open it to the public a couple of years ago. Interesting to visit and know the story of the owner.Specially interesting is the front side of the house facing the river. It is to commemorate",
          "Wow I'm so glad i walked all the way here from the Sheraton. Well worth it. The building is so odd and so out of place, yet so cool and so much detail. I did not go inside although it looks as if it is a play house or theater. So nice.",
          "I so enjoyed this tour, very interesting story behind the castle, and a lovely guide to explain it all in Spanish. My Spanish is limited, but my family living in Montevideo translated for me. Our guide was able to speak English, but told me she was not allowed to give the tour",
          "stumbled across this bizarre building while walking along the Rambla. i wish i'd known about it before hand as it sounds great. i just assumed it was a folly. as an aside, opposite here there are a few trees that seem to be a magnet for parrots.",
          "If you walk around the Rambla in Punta Carretas, you will find it. You just can't stop watching it. Get in, ask for the tour, but most important, learn its history. Legend says the Grial was hidden here during WWII. It was build by a strange man, architect, alchemist,",
          "I stumbled upon this outrageous looking structure as I was walking along the Rambla. Curious, I inquired and was told there are guided tours available. Spanish is not my native tongue, however, I understand enough to have understood what the guide was describing. The history of",
          "Worth while to stop and see. I was walking around the city and there was a crowd in front of the little castle. They have some great architecture and entertainment. You have an old building surrounded by more modern architecture. Montevideo is really a European, Italians",

          "Built by Humberto Pittamiglio, an architect and alchemist, this eccentric little red-brick \"castle\" is located on the Rambla in Positos (facing the waterfront). Full of charm with walls crafted of deep dark wood, narrow staircases, strange rooms and complete with a tower, statue",
          "You wouldn\u00b4t know this place was built by an achemist unless someone tells you. The place is very transge - with stairs that lead nowhere and geometrical-shaped rooms, accompained by a very interesting explanation from the local guides. The entrance fee is not expensive at all."

          "Small in size as museums go but they packed a lot of artifacts, information, video, in a small space. Funny that this took us about 1.5 hours to go through the museum seeing how small it was. I am of an age that remembers this terrible accident so it was very interesting to me,",

          "The place is way expensive for the content. You may feel touched by the story of 25+ adults barely surviving in Andes mountains, pieces of crashed aircraft and how they used replaceable parts to survive. Still it will not help you to know more about Uruguay culture and history.",
          "Yesterday I visited the Museum that has been dedicated to the tragedy and miracle to the Andes, after watching a DVD on the story of the tragedy and all the equipment and photos that are on display; I came out with such an admiration and a heavy heart of this miracle. A must for",

          "I remember the film, but the museum gave me so much more. To see the personal belongings and the black and white photos made such an big impact. I had to read more about the survivors when I got home. Don't miss out on this",
          "We intended a quick visit, but ended up spending almost three hours in this inspiring museum. The museum gives an outstanding overview of both the tragedy and the miracle of the 1972 Andes plane crash in which a group of young men managed to survive hardship through team work",

        "wiki": "Estadio Centenario is a stadium in the Parque Batlle neighborhood of Montevideo, Uruguay, used primarily for football.  The stadium was built between 1929 and 1930 to host the inaugural 1930 FIFA World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay's first constitution.  It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums. On July 18, 1983, it was declared by FIFA as the only historical monument of World Football, the only building of its kind worldwide.Estadio Centenario is the primary home of the Uruguay national team.  Uruguay has always been a threat when playing in their home stadium, consistently beating top teams. Even the top ranked Brazil national football team has only managed three wins in 20 opportunities; two were official matches during 2010 and 2018 World Cup qualification, but one was Uruguay's heaviest defeat at the stadium, when they lost 4\u20130 to Brazil in 2009.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe construction of the Centenario is one of the most important stages in the development of sports in South America and international football. It was built especially for the organization of the 1930 FIFA World Cup, by immigrant workers in a record time of nine months. Its name originates from the celebration of 100 years of the ratification of the first Constitution of Uruguay.\nInitially, all World Cup matches were to be played in the Centenario. However, heavy rains in Montevideo delayed construction of the stadium, so that several matches had to be played in the Pocitos Stadium of Club Atl\u00e9tico Pe\u00f1arol, and the Parque Central of Club Nacional de Football. It was inaugurated on July 18, 1930, in the match between Uruguay and Peru, with the Celeste gaining victory 1\u20130, with a goal by Hector \"Manco\" Castro.\n\nThe final match of the inaugural World Cup matched Uruguay and Argentina, with Uruguay winning 4\u20132. Since then, the Centenario has been the scene of Copa Am\u00e9rica (1942, 1956, 1967, 1995), three South American Youth Championships (1979, 2003, 2015), a South American Under-17 Football Championship (1999) and 1980 Mundialito.\n\n\n== Tenants ==\n\nAside from the Uruguay national team, any football club can rent the stadium for its home matches. Pe\u00f1arol has done that often, and Nacional rents it for some international matches. Pe\u00f1arol played all of its home matches at the stadium from 1933 until it moved to Estadio Campe\u00f3n del Siglo in 2016.\nIn the case of other Uruguayan teams, they often decide to play there against both Pe\u00f1arol and Nacional.\n\n\n== Grandstands ==\nThe stadium has four Grandstand separated by four lanes. The main one is the Olympic Tribune (and lower Platea known as Olympic), which is named so because the team had won two Olympic championships in a row (1924 and 1928). This has a maximum capacity of 21,648 spectators located in the three rings and the audience. Then there are the \"popular\", so called because they are sold cheaper, these are: the Colombes, in honor of the Colombes, France in which the national team became Olympic champions 1924 and Amsterdam, because it was where the Celeste were crowned Olympic champions for the second time in 1928.  The Grandstand Colombes accommodates 13,914 spectators while the Amsterdam accommodates 13,923. The  America Tribune is parallel to the  Olympic one. There are also \"VIP\" boxes and press boxes with room for 1,882 spectators, as well as the platform has room for 2,911 spectators, and additionally the grandstand has room for 5,957 people.Under the Olympic Grandstand are located primary school \"N\u00ba 100 H\u00e9ctor F\u00edgoli\"; and the Museum of Uruguayan Football. Under the Colombes Grandstand is located Police Station N\u00ba9.\n\n\n== Concerts ==\nThe stadium has held numerous concerts by both national and international artists such as:\n\nAerosmith\nAmaral\n\u00c1rbol\nArnaldo Antunes\nAttaque 77\nBrian May\nBryan Adams\nBuitres Despu\u00e9s de la Una\nCharly Garc\u00eda\nChayanne\nEnrique Iglesias\nEric Clapton\nFito P\u00e1ez\nGuns N' Roses\nJoaqu\u00edn Sabina\nJoe Cocker\nJoe Vasconcellos\nJorge Drexler\nLos Olimare\u00f1os\nLos Piojos\nLuciano Pavarotti\nLuis Miguel\nMan\u00e1\nNo Te Va Gustar\nNortec Collective\nOne Direction\nPatricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota\nPaul McCartney\nPl\u00e1cido Domingo\nReyToro\nRicardo Arjona\nRod Stewart\nRoger Waters\nRoxette\nRub\u00e9n Blades\nSebastian Bach\nSer\u00fa Gir\u00e1n\nSoledad Pastorutti\nSoy Luna Live\nSting\nSui Generis\nThe Rolling Stones\nTeen Angels\nThe Cult\n\n\n== 1930 FIFA World Cup ==\nEstadio Centenario hosted ten games of the 1930 FIFA World Cup, including the opening and the final matches.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n3.

        "wiki": "Montevideo (Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u03b2i\u02c8\u00f0eo]) is the capital and largest city of Uruguay. According to the 2011 census, the city proper has a population of 1,319,108 (about one-third of the country's total population) in an area of 201 square kilometres (78 sq mi). The southernmost capital city in the Americas, Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the R\u00edo de la Plata.\nThe city was established in 1724 by a Spanish soldier, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, as a strategic move amidst the Spanish-Portuguese dispute over the platine region. It was also under brief British rule in 1807. Montevideo is the seat of the administrative headquarters of Mercosur and ALADI, Latin America's leading trade blocs, a position that entailed comparisons to the role of Brussels in Europe.The 2019 Mercer's report on quality of life, rated Montevideo first in Latin America, a rank the city has consistently held since 2005. As of 2010, Montevideo was the 19th largest city economy in the continent and 9th highest income earner among major cities. In 2020, it has a projected GDP of $49.7 billion, with a per capita of $28,385.In 2018, it was classified as a beta global city ranking eighth in Latin America and 84th in the world. Montevideo hosted every match during the first FIFA World Cup, in 1930. Described as a \"vibrant, eclectic place with a rich cultural life\", and \"a thriving tech center and entrepreneurial culture\", Montevideo ranked eighth in Latin America on the 2013 MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.In 2014, it was also regarded as the fifth most gay-friendly metropolis in the world and the first in Latin America. It is the hub of commerce and higher education in Uruguay as well as its chief port. The city is also the financial hub of Uruguay and the cultural anchor of a metropolitan area with a population of around 2 million.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are several explanations about the word Montevideo. All agree that \"Monte\" refers to the Cerro de Montevideo, the hill situated across the Bay of Montevideo, but there is disagreement about the etymological origin of the \"video\" part.\n\nMonte vide eu (\"I saw a mount\") is the most widespread belief but is rejected by the majority of experts, who consider it unlikely because it involves a mix of dialects. The name would come from a Portuguese expression which means \"I saw a mount\", wrongly pronounced by an anonymous sailor belonging to the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes on catching sight of the Cerro de Montevideo.\nMonte Vidi: This hypothesis comes from the \"Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n\" (Navigational Calendar) of boatswain Francisco de Albo, member of the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes, who wrote, \"Tuesday of the said [month of January 1520] we were on the straits of Cape Santa Mar\u00eda [now Punta del Este], from where the coast runs east to west, and the terrain is sandy, and at the right of the cape there is a mountain like a hat to which we gave the name \"Montevidi\".\" This is the oldest Spanish document that mentions the promontory with a name similar to the one that designates the city, but it does not contain any mention of the alleged cry \"Monte vide eu.\"\nMonte-VI-D-E-O (Monte VI De Este a Oeste): According to Rolando Laguarda Tr\u00edas, professor of history, the Spaniards annotated the geographic location on a map or Portolan chart, so that the mount/hill is the VI (6th) mount observable on the coast, navigating R\u00edo de la Plata from east to west. With the passing of time, these words were unified to \"Montevideo\". No conclusive evidence has been found to confirm this academic hypothesis nor can it be asserted with certainty which were the other five mounts observable before the Cerro.\nMonte Ovidio (Monte Santo Ovidio), a less widespread hypothesis of a religious origin, stems from an interpolation in the aforementioned Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n of Fernando de Albo, where it is asserted \"corruptly now called Santo Vidio\" when they refer to the hat-like mount which they named Monte Vidi (that is, the Cerro de Montevideo). Ovidio (Saint Ovidius) was the third bishop of the Portuguese city of Braga, where he was always revered; a monument to him was erected there in 1505. Given the relationship that the Portuguese had with the discovery and foundation of Montevideo, and despite the fact that this hypothesis, like the previous ones, lacks conclusive documentation, there have been those who linked the name of Santo Ovidio or Vidio (appearing on some maps of the time) with the subsequent derivation of the name \"Montevideo\" given to the region since the early years of the 16th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBetween 1680 and 1683, Portugal founded the city of Colonia do Sacramento in the region across the bay from Buenos Aires. This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca of Portugal built the Montevieu fort.\nA Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were known as Guanches or Canarians. There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name of Jorge Burgues.A census of the city's inhabitants was performed in 1724 and then a plan was drawn delineating the city and designating it as San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo, later shortened to Montevideo. The census counted fifty families of Galician and Canary Islands origin, more than 1000 indigenous people, mostly Guaran\u00ed, as well as Black African slaves of Bantu origin.A few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the R\u00edo de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River, competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata brought it in confrontations with the city of Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was taken over to be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.\nIn 1776, Spain made Montevideo its main naval base (Real Apostadero de Marina) for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, Fernando Po, and the Falklands.Until the end of the 18th century, Montevideo remained a fortified area, today known as Ciudad Vieja.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nOn 3 February 1807, British troops under the command of General Samuel Auchmuty and Admiral Charles Stirling occupied the city during the Battle of Montevideo (1807), but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the same year on 2 September when John Whitelocke was forced to surrender to troops formed by forces of the Banda Oriental\u2014roughly the same area as modern Uruguay\u2014and of Buenos Aires. After this conflict, the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de El\u00edo opposed the new viceroy Santiago de Liniers, and created a government Junta when the Peninsular War started in Spain, in defiance of Liniers. El\u00edo disestablished the Junta when Liniers was replaced by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros.\nDuring the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo. During that year and the next, Uruguayan revolutionary Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain. In 1811, the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo, which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution. The siege was lifted at the end of that year, when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region.The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814. In 1816, Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821, it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil. It was named Imperial City by Emperor Pedro I when the city was part of the Empire of Brazil as capital of the Cisplatina province. Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the Treinta y Tres Orientales (\"Thirty-Three Orientals\") re-established the independence of the region in 1825. Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828, with Montevideo as the nation's capital. In 1829, the demolition of the city's fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja, referred to as the \"Ciudad Nueva\" (\"new city\"). Urban expansion, however, moved very slowly because of the events that followed.\n\nUruguay's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between Manuel Oribe and Fructuoso Rivera, the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the Empire of Brazil under the command of Lavalleja, each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction. Politics were divided between Oribe's Blancos (\"whites\"), represented by the National Party, and Rivera's Colorados (\"reds\"), represented by the Colorado Party, with each party's name taken from the colour of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the Guerra Grande, which lasted until 1851.\nThe city of Montevideo suffered a siege of eight years between 1843 and 1851, during which it was supplied by sea with British and French support. Oribe, with the support of the then conservative Governor of Buenos Aires Province Juan Manuel de Rosas, besieged the Colorados in Montevideo, where the latter were supported by the French Legion, the Italian Legion, the Basque Legion and battalions from Brazil. Finally, in 1851, with the additional support of Argentine rebels who opposed Rosas, the Colorados defeated Oribe. The fighting, however, resumed in 1855, when the Blancos came to power, which they maintained until 1865. Thereafter, the Colorado Party regained power, which they retained until past the middle of the 20th century.\nAfter the end of hostilities, a period of growth and expansion started for the city. In 1853 a stagecoach bus line was established joining Montevideo with the newly formed settlement of Uni\u00f3n and the first natural gas street lights were inaugurated. From 1854 to 1861 the first public sanitation facilities were constructed. In 1856 the Teatro Sol\u00eds was inaugurated, 15 years after the beginning of its construction. By Decree, in December 1861 the areas of Aguada and Cord\u00f3n were incorporated to the growing Ciudad Nueva (New City). In 1866, an underwater telegraph line connected the city with Buenos Aires. The statue of Peace, La Paz, was erected on a column in Plaza Cagancha and the building of the Postal Service as well as the bridge of Paso Molino were inaugurated in 1867.In 1868, the horse-drawn tram company Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tranv\u00edas al Paso del Molino y Cerro created the first lines connecting Montevideo with Uni\u00f3n, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro, at the time called Cosmopolis. In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras. During the same year and the next, the neighbourhoods Col\u00f3n, Nuevo Par\u00eds and La Comercial were founded. The Sunday market of Trist\u00e1n Narvaja Street was established in Cord\u00f3n in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, Bulevar Circunvalaci\u00f3n was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas, going up to the north end of the city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed to Artigas Boulevard (its current name) in 1885. By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area Los Pocitos was incorporated to the Nov\u00edsima Ciudad (Most New City).The first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas operated ones in 1886. The Hip\u00f3dromo de Maro\u00f1as started operating in 1888, and the neighbourhoods of Reus del Sur, Reus del Norte and Conciliaci\u00f3n were inaugurated in 1889. The new building of the School of Arts and Trades, as well as Zabala Square in Ciudad Vieja were inaugurated in 1890, followed by the Italian Hospital in 1891. In the same year, the village of Pe\u00f1arol was founded. Other neighbourhoods that were founded were Belgrano and Belvedere in 1892, Jacinto Vera in 1895 and Trouville in 1897. In 1894 the new port was constructed, and in 1897, the Central Railway Station of Montevideo was inaugurated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, many Europeans (particularly Spaniards and Italians but also thousands from Central Europe) immigrated to the city. In 1908, 30% of the city's population of 300,000 was foreign-born. In that decade the city expanded quickly: new neighbourhoods were created and many separate settlements were annexed to the city, among which were the Villa del Cerro, Pocitos, the Prado and Villa Col\u00f3n. The Rod\u00f3 Park and the Estadio Gran Parque Central were also established, which served as poles of urban development.During the early 20th century, Uruguay saw huge social changes with repercussions primarily in urban areas. Among these changes were the right of divorce (1907) and women's right to vote.The 1910s saw the construction of Montevideo's Rambla; strikes by tram workers, bakers and port workers; the inauguration of electric trams; the creation of the Municipal Intendencias; and the inauguration of the new port.In 1913, the city limits were extended around the entire gulf. The previously independent localities of the Villa del Cerro and La Teja were annexed to Montevideo, becoming two of its neighborhoods.During the 1920s, the equestrian statue of Artigas was installed in Plaza Independencia; the Palacio Legislativo was built; the Spanish Plus Ultra flying boat arrived (the first airplane to fly from Spain to Latin America, 1926); prominent politician and former president Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez died (1929); and ground was broken (1929) for the Estadio Centenario (completed 1930).During World War II, a famous incident involving the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee took place in Punta del Este, 200 kilometers (120 mi) from Montevideo. After the Battle of the River Plate with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy on 13 December 1939, the Graf Spee retreated to Montevideo's port, which was considered neutral at the time. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on 17 December. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. The eagle figurehead of the Graf Spee was salvaged on 10 February 2006; to protect the feelings of those still sensitive to Nazi Germany, the swastika on the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water.\n\nUruguay began to stagnate economically in the mid-1950s; Montevideo began a decline, later exacerbated by widespread social and political violence beginning in 1968 (including the emergence of the guerrilla Movimiento de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional-Tupamaros) and by the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985). There were major problems with supply; the immigration cycle was reversed.\nFrom the 1960s to the end of the dictatorship in 1985, around one hundred people died or disappeared because of the political violence. From 1974 another hundred Uruguayans disappeared also in Argentina. In 1980, the dictatorship proposed a new constitution. The project was submitted to referendum and rejected in the first polls since 1971, with 58% of the votes against and 42% in favour. The result weakened the military and triggered its fall, allowing the return of democracy.In the 1980s, Pope John Paul II visited the city twice. In April 1987, as head of state of Vatican, he signed a mediation agreement for the conflict of the Beagle Channel. He also held a large mass in Tres Cruces, declaring the cross located behind the altar as a monument. In 1988, he returned to the country, visiting Montevideo, Florida, Salto and Melo.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe 2002 Uruguay banking crisis affected several industries of Montevideo. In 2017, the city has maintained 15 years of economic growth, with a GDP of $44 billion, and a GDP per capita of $25,900.Montevideo has consistently been rated as having the highest quality of life of any city in Latin America: by 2015 it held this rank every year during the decade through 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMontevideo is situated on the north shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata, the arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the south coast of Uruguay from the north coast of Argentina; Buenos Aires lies 230 kilometres (140 mi) west on the Argentine side. The Santa Luc\u00eda River forms a natural border between Montevideo and San Jos\u00e9 Department to its west. To the city's north and east is Canelones Department, with the stream of Carrasco forming the eastern natural border. The coastline forming the city's southern border is interspersed with rocky protrusions and sandy beaches. The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbour, the nation's largest and one of the largest in the Southern Cone, and the finest natural port in the region, functioning as a crucial component of the Uruguayan economy and foreign trade. Various streams criss-cross the town and empty into the Bay of Montevideo. Its coastline near the emptying rivers are heavily polluted.The city has an average elevation of 43 metres (141 ft). Its highest elevations are two hills: the Cerro de Montevideo and the Cerro de la Victoria, with the highest point, the peak of Cerro de Montevideo, crowned by a fortress, the Fortaleza del Cerro at a height of 134 m (440 ft). Closest cities by road are Las Piedras to the north and the so-called Ciudad de la Costa (a conglomeration of coastal towns) to the east, both in the range of 20 to 25 km (16 mi) from the city center. The approximate distances to the neighbouring department capitals by road are, 90 km (56 mi) to San Jose de Mayo (San Jose Department) and 46 km (29 mi) to Canelones (Canelones Department).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontevideo enjoys a humid subtropical climate (Cfa, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). The city has mild winters (June to September), warm-hot summers (December to March) and volatile springs (October and November); there are numerous thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout the year, reaching around 950 millimetres (37 in).Winters are generally cool, wet, windy and overcast. During this season, there are bursts of icy and relatively dry winds of continental polar air masses, giving an unpleasant chilly feeling to the everyday life of the city. Frosts occur few times during winter, generally not falling below 28\u00b0 F (-2\u00b0 C) because of the oceanic influence that moderates the temperature; few miles away from the coast, frosts are more common and colder. Rainfall and sleet are a frequent winter occurrence, but snowfall is extremely rare: flurries have been recorded only four times but with no accumulation, the last one on 13 July 1930 during the inaugural match of the World Cup, (the other three snowfalls were in 1850, 1853 and 1917); the alleged 1980 Carrasco snowfall was actually a hailstorm.Summers are warm-hot and humid, with less wind than other seasons. During this season, a moderate wind often blows from the sea in the evenings which has a pleasant cooling effect on the city, in contrast to the more-severe summer heat of nearby cities like Buenos Aires. Heat waves come with the north winds, which bring humid and hot air masses from the tropical interior of the continent. These warm periods are usually followed by thunderstorms, generated by cold fronts of the southwest that lowers temperatures considerably. This phenomenon is regional, and can occur several times all year long.\nMontevideo has an annual average temperature of 16.7 \u00b0C (62.1 \u00b0F). The lowest recorded temperature is \u22125.6 \u00b0C (21.9 \u00b0F) while the highest is 42.8 \u00b0C (109.0 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions and barrios ===\n\nAs of 2010, the city of Montevideo has been divided into 8 political municipalities (Municipios), referred to with the letters from A to G, including CH, each presided over by a mayor elected by the citizens registered in the constituency. This division, according to the Municipality of Montevideo, \"aims to advance political and administrative decentralization in the department of Montevideo, with the aim of deepening the democratic participation of citizens in governance.\" The head of each Municipio is called an alcalde or (if female) alcaldesa.Of much greater importance is the division of the city into 62 barrios: neighbourhoods or wards. Many of the city's barrios\u2014such as Sayago, Ituzaing\u00f3 and Pocitos\u2014were previously geographically separate settlements, later absorbed by the growth of the city. Others grew up around certain industrial sites, including the salt-curing works of Villa del Cerro and the tanneries in Nuevo Par\u00eds. Each barrio has its own identity, geographic location and socio-cultural activities. A neighbourhood of great significance is Ciudad Vieja, that was surrounded by a protective wall until 1829. This area contains most important buildings of the colonial era and early decades of independence.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n\nThe architecture of Montevideo ranges from Neoclassical buildings such as the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral to the Postmodern style of the World Trade Center Montevideo or the 158-metre (518 ft) ANTEL Telecommunication Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the country. The Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the Palacio Salvo dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building facades in the Old Town reflect the city's extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the Legislative Palace, the City Hall, Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower. The most notable sports stadium is the Estadio Centenario within Parque Batlle. Parque Batlle, Parque Rod\u00f3 and Parque Prado are Montevideo's three great parks.The Pocitos district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the \"Edificio Panamericano\" designed by Raul Sichero, and the \"Positano\" and \"El Pilar\" designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis Garc\u00eda Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighbourhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle class residents.\n\n\n==== Palacio Legislativo ====\n\nThe Palacio Legislativo in Aguada, the north of the city centre, is currently the seat of the Uruguayan Parliament. Construction started in 1904 and was sponsored by the government of President Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. It was designed by Italian architects Vittorio Meano and Gaetano Moretti, who planned the building's interior. Among the notable contributors to the project was sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni, who contributed numerous reliefs and allegorical sculptures.\n\n\n==== World Trade Center Montevideo ====\n\nWorld Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998, but work was completed in 2009. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998. It has 22 floors and 17,100 square metres of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and 27,000 square metres (290,000 sq ft) of space. The 6,300-square-metre (68,000 sq ft) World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a centre of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St. Among the establishments on the plaza are Burger King, Walrus, Bamboo, Asia de Cuba, Gardenia Mvd, and La Claraboya Cafe.\nThe Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social place. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor Pablo Atchugarry. World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and 53,500 square metres (576,000 sq ft) of space is under construction as of 2010.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications Tower ====\n\nTorre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the 158 metres (518 ft), 37-floor headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company, ANTEL, and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect Carlos Ott. It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by American Bridge and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.\nWhen its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40 million, plus US$25 million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65 million price into US$102 million.\n\n\n==== Ciudad Vieja (Old City) ====\n\nCiudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent barrio of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and night-clubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.\n\nMontevideo's most important plaza is Plaza Independencia, located between Ciudad Vieja and downtown Montevideo. It starts with the Gateway of The Citadel at one end and ends at the beginning of 18 de Julio Avenue. It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city. Several notable buildings are located here.  The Sol\u00eds Theatre is Uruguay's oldest theatre. It was built in 1856 and is currently owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theatre, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by Philippe Starck. The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theatre reopened in August of that year. The plaza is also the site of the offices of the President of Uruguay (both the Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower). The Artigas Mausoleum is located at the centre of the plaza. Statues include that of Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, hero of Uruguay's independence movement; an honour guard keeps vigil at the Mausoleum.Palacio Salvo, at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands 100 metres (330 ft) high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confiter\u00eda La Giralda, renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez wrote his tango \"La Cumparsita\" (1917.) Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.Also of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (or Plaza Matriz). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the Cabildo\u2014the seat of colonial government\u2014and the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral. The cathedral is the burial place of Fructuoso Rivera, Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Venancio Flores. Another notable square is Plaza Zabala with the equestrian statue of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On its south side, Palacio Taranco, once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto, another major tourist destination.\n\n\n==== Parque Batlle ====\n\nParque Batlle (formerly: Parque de los Aliados, translation: \"Park of the Allies\") is a major public central park, located south of Avenida Italia and north of Avenue Rivera. Along with Parque Prado and Parque Rod\u00f3 it is one of three large parks that dominate Montevideo. The park and surrounding area constitute one of the 62 neighbourhoods (barrios) of the city. The barrio of Parque Batlle is one of seven coastal barrios, the others being Buceo, Carrasco, Malvin, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, and Punta Gorda. The current barrio of Parque Battle includes four former districts: Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and Batlle Park itself and borders the neighbourhoods of La Blanqueada, Tres Cruces, Pocitos and Buceo. It has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income. Villa Dolores, a subdistrict of Parque Batlle, took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Do\u00f1a Dolores Pereira de Rossel. On their grounds, they started a private collection of animals that became a zoological garden and was passed to the city in 1919; in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises.\n\nParque Batlle is named in honour of Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915. The park was originally proposed by an Act of March 1907, which also projected wide boulevards and avenues. French landscape architect, Carlos Thays, began the plantings in 1911. In 1918, the park was named Parque de los Aliados, following the victory of the Allies of World War I. On 5 May 1930, after significant expansion, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, in memory of the prominent politician and president, who had died in 1929. The park was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975. As of 2010, the park covers an area of 60 hectares (150 acres) and is considered the \"lung\" of the Montevideo city due to the large variety of trees planted here.The Estadio Centenario, the national football stadium, opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, and later hosted several other sporting grounds of note (see Sports).\nIn 1934, sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni's \"La Carreta\", a bronze monument on granite base, was installed on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario. One of several statues in the park, it depicts yoked oxen pulling a loaded wagon. It was designated a national monument in 1976. Another statue on the same side of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron.\nOn the west side of Parque Batlle, on Artigas Boulevard, the 1938 Obelisk of Montevideo is a monument dedicated to those who created the first Constitution. The work of sculptor Jos\u00e9 Luis Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn (1891\u20131975), it is a three-sided granite obelisk, 40 metres (130 ft) tall, with bronze statues on its three sides, representing \"Law\", \"Liberty\", and \"Force\", respectively. It has been a National Heritage Site since 1976.\n\n\n==== Parque Prado ====\n\nEstablished in 1873, the largest of Montevideo's six main public parks is the 1.06-square-kilometre (260-acre) Parque Prado. Located in the northern part of the city, the Miguelete Creek flows through the park and the neighbourhood and of the same name. It is surrounded by the avenues Agraciada, Obes Lucas, Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez, Luis Alberto de Herrera and by the streets Castro and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyes.\nThe most frequented areas of the park are the Rosedal, a public rose garden with pergolas, the Botanical Garden, the area around the Hotel del Prado, as well as the Rural del Prado, a seasonal cattle and farm animal fairground. The Rosedal contains four pergolas, eight domes, and a fountain; its 12,000 roses were imported from France in 1910. There are several jogging paths along the Miguelete river.\nThe Presidential Residence is located behind the Botanical Gardens. Established in 1930, Juan Manuel Blanes Museum is situated in the Palladian villa, a National Heritage Site since 1975, and includes a Japanese garden. The Professor Atilio Lombardo Museum and Botanical Gardens were established in 1902. The National Institute of Physical Climatology and its observatory are also in the Prado.\n\n\n==== Parque Rod\u00f3 ====\n\nParque Rod\u00f3 is both a barrio (neighbourhood) of Montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighbourhood itself and belongs to Punta Carretas. The name \"Rod\u00f3\" commemorates Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, an important Uruguayan writer whose monument is in the southern side of the main park. The park was conceived as a French-style city park. Apart from the main park area which is delimited by Sarmiento Avenue to the south, Parque Rod\u00f3 includes an amusement park; the Estadio Luis Franzini, belonging to Defensor Sporting; the front lawn of the Faculty of Engineering and a strip west of the Club de Golf de Punta Carretas that includes the Canteras (\"quarry\") del Parque Rod\u00f3, the Teatro de Verano (\"summer theatre\") and the Lago (\"lake\") del Parque Rod\u00f3.On the east side of the main park area is the National Museum of Visual Arts. On this side, a street market takes place every Sunday. On the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children. An area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography. West of the park, across the coastal avenue Rambla Presidente Wilson, stretches Ramirez Beach. Directly west of the main park are, and belonging to Parque Rod\u00f3 barrio, is the former Parque Hotel, now called Edif\u00edcio Mercosur, seat of the parliament of the members countries of the Mercosur. During the guerilla war the Tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area, including the old hotel.\n\n\n==== Forts ====\nThe first set of subsidiary forts were planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at Colonia del Sacramento. However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship Nossa Senhora de Oliveara. They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.\n\n\n===== Fortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro) =====\n\nFortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839. It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931 and has housed a military museum since 1916. Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.\n\n\n==== Punta Brava Lighthouse ====\n\nPunta Brava Lighthouse (Faro Punta Brava), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876. The lighthouse is 21 metres (69 ft) high and its light reaches 24 km (15 mi) away, with a flash every ten seconds. In 1962, the lighthouse became electric. The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Ingl\u00e9s Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Luc\u00eda River.\n\n\n==== Rambla of Montevideo ====\n\nThe Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word rambla is \"avenue\" or \"watercourse\", but in the Americas it is mostly used as \"coastal avenue\", and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the R\u00edo de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas (\"United Nations\"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.\n\nThe Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even\u2014in a special area\u2014skateboard. Its 27-kilometre (17 mi) length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.Montevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city. Its best known beaches are Ram\u00edrez, Pocitos, Carrasco, Buceo and Malv\u00edn. Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.\n\n\n==== Cemeteries ====\n\nThere are five large cemeteries in Montevideo, all administered by the \"F\u00fanebre y Necr\u00f3polis\" annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Juan Manuel Blanes, Fran\u00e7ois Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont (Isidore Ducasse), Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, and Juan Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn.\nThe other large cemeteries are the Cementerio del Buceo, Cementerio del Cerro, and Cementerio Paso Molino.\nThe British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Brit\u00e1nico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighborhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Mr. Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors, contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine, Henry de Costa, is buried here.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nIn 1860, Montevideo had 57,913 inhabitants including a number of people of African origin who had been brought as slaves and had gained their freedom around the middle of the century. By 1880, the population had quadrupled, mainly because of the great European immigration. In 1908, its population had grown massively to 309,331 inhabitants. In the course of the 20th century the city continued to receive large numbers of European immigrants, especially Spanish and Italian, followed by French, Germans, English, Irish, Swiss, Austrians, Poles, Dutch, Greek, Hungarians, Russians, Croats, Lebanese, Armenians, and Jews of various origins. The last wave of immigrants occurred between 1945 and 1955.According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay's total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of \u22121.5 per thousand. Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975\u20131985, which showed a rate of \u22125.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004. However, mortality continued to fall with life expectancy at birth for both sexes increasing by 1.73 years.In the census of 2011, Montevideo had a population of 1,319,108.\nSource: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica de Uruguay\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Intendencia de Montevideo ===\n\nThe Municipality of Montevideo was first created by a legal act of 18 December 1908. The municipality's first mayor (1909\u20131911) was Daniel Mu\u00f1oz. Municipalities were abolished by the Uruguayan Constitution of 1918, effectively restored during the 1933 military coup of Gabriel Terra, and formally restored by the 1934 Constitution. The 1952 Constitution again decided to abolish the municipalities; it came into effect in February 1955. Municipalities were replaced by departmental councils, which consisted of a collegiate executive board with 7 members from Montevideo and 5 from the interior region. However, municipalities were revived under the 1967 Constitution and have operated continuously since that time.\nSince 1990, Montevideo has been partially decentralized into 18 areas; administration and services for each area is provided by its Zonal Community Center (Centro Comunal Zonal, CCZ), which is subordinate to the Municipality of Montevideo. The boundaries of the municipal districts of Montevideo were created on 12 July 1993, and successively amended on 19 October 1993, 6 June 1994 and 10 November 1994.\nThe city government of Montevideo performs several functions, including maintaining communications with the public, promoting culture, organizing society, caring for the environment and regulating traffic. Its headquarters is the Palacio Municipal on 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro area of Montevideo.Another body, the Junta Departamental, or the Congress of Montevideo, governs the Department of Montevideo. The Junta, composed of 31 unsalaried elected members, is responsible for such things as the freedom of the citizens, the regulation of cultural activities, the naming of streets and public places, and the placement of monuments; it also responds to proposals of the Intendant in various circumstances. Its seat is the architecturally remarkable Casa de Francisco G\u00f3mez in Ciudad Vieja.A 2016 private ranking named Subnational Legislative Online Opening Index measured the data availability in official websites, scoring Montevideo as the second most open district nationally at 17.50 points.\n\n\n=== Intendants of Montevideo ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn recent years Montevideo nightlife has moved to Parque Rod\u00f3, where a large concentration of buildings cater for the recreational interests of young people during the night time. Under a presidential decree of 1 March 2006 smoking is prohibited in any public place with roofing, and there is a prohibition on the sale of alcohol in certain businesses from 21.00 to 9.00.Montevideo has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Literature since December 2015.\n\n\n=== The arts ===\nMontevideo has a very rich architectural heritage and an impressive number of writers, artists, and musicians. Uruguayan tango is a unique form of dance that originated in the neighbourhoods of Montevideo towards the end of the 1800s. Tango, candombe and murga are the three main styles of music in this city. The city is also the centre of the cinema of Uruguay, which includes commercial, documentary and experimental films. There are two movie theatre companies running seven cinemas, around ten independent ones and four art film cinemas in the city. The theatre of Uruguay is admired inside and outside Uruguayan borders. The Sol\u00eds Theatre is the most prominent theatre in Uruguay and the oldest in South America. There are several notable theatrical companies and thousands of professional actors and amateurs. Montevideo playwrights produce dozens of works each year; of major note are Mauricio Rosencof, Ana Magnabosco and Ricardo Prieto. \n\n\n==== Visual arts ====\n\nThe daily newspaper El Pa\u00eds sponsors the Virtual Museum of contemporary Uruguayan art. The director and curator of the Museum presents exhibitions in \"virtual spaces, supplemented by information, biographies, texts in English and Spanish\".In the early 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo, one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a \"hotbed of resistance\". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nThe first public library in Montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of Father Jos\u00e9 Manuel P\u00e9rez Castellano, who died in 1815. Its promoter, director and organizer was Father D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga, who also made a considerable donation along with donations from Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Guerra, as well as others from the Convent of San Francisco in Salta. In 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes. The current building of the National Library of Uruguay (Biblioteca P\u00fablica de Uruguay) was designed by Luis Crespi in the Neoclassical style and occupies an area of 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). Construction began in 1926 and it was finally inaugurated in 1964. Its current collection amounts to roughly 900,000 volumes.\n\n\n===== Authors =====\n\nThe city has a long and rich literary tradition. Although Uruguayan literature is not limited to the authors of the capital (Horacio Quiroga was born in Salto and Mario Benedetti in Paso de los Toros, for instance), Montevideo has been and is the centre of the editorial and creative activity of literature.\nIn 1900, the city had a remarkable group of writers, including Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Julio Herrera y Reissig, Delmira Agustini and Felisberto Hern\u00e1ndez. Montevideo was then called the \"Atenas del Plata\" or the \"Athens of the Rio de la Plata\".\n\nAmong the outstanding authors of Montevideo of the second half of the 20th century are Juan Carlos Onetti, Antonio Larreta, Eduardo Galeano, Marosa di Giorgio and Cristina Peri Rossi.A new generation of writers have become known internationally in recent years. These include Eduardo Espina (essayist and poet), Fernando Butazzoni (novelist), Rafael Courtoisie (poet) and Hugo Burel (short story writer and novelist).\n\n\n==== Music ====\nIn Montevideo, as throughout the Rio de Plata region, the most popular forms of music are tango, milonga and vals criollo. Many notable songs originated in Montevideo including \"El Tango supremo\", La Cumparsita\", La Milonga\", \"La Pu\u00f1alada\" and \"Desde el Alma\", composed by notable Montevideo musicians such as Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez, Pint\u00edn Castellanos and Rosita Melo. Tango is deeply ingrained in the cultural life of the city and is the theme for many of the bars and restaurants in the city. Fun Fun' Bar, established in 1935, is one of the most important places for tango in Uruguay as is El Farolito, located in the old part of the city and Joventango, Caf\u00e9 Las Musas, Garufa and Vieja Viola. The city is also home to the Montevideo Jazz Festival and has the Bancaria Jazz Club bar catering for jazz enthusiasts.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe center of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto (\"Port Market\"). Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. A torta frita is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the centre for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt. Montevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Recreation ===\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nA Cultural Centre of Spain, as well as Asturian and cultural centres, testify to Montevideo's considerable Spanish heritage. Montevideo also has important museums including Museo Torres Garc\u00eda, Museo Jos\u00e9 Gurvich, Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales and Museo Juan Manuel Blanes etc.\nThe Montevideo Cabildo was the seat of government during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata. It is located in front of Constitution Square, in Ciudad Vieja. Built between 1804 and 1869 in Neoclassical style, with a series of Doric and Ionic columns, it became a National Heritage Site in 1975. In 1958, the Municipal Historic Museum and Archive was inaugurated here. It features three permanent city museum exhibitions, as well as temporary art exhibitions, cultural events, seminars, symposiums and forums.\n\nThe Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo's first theatre (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules-L\u00e9on Chifflot who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site. The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts, ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th\u201318th century from the area of present-day Iran. The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government.\n\nThe National History Museum of Montevideo is located in the historical residence of General Fructuoso Rivera. It exhibits artifacts related to the history of Uruguay. In a process begun in 1998, the National Museum of Natural History (1837) and the National Museum of Anthropology (1981), merged in 2001, becoming the National Museum of Natural History and Anthropology. In July 2009, the two institutions again became independent. The Historical Museum has annexed eight historical houses in the city, five of which are located in the Ciudad Vieja. One of them, on the same block with the main building, is the historic residence of Antonio Montero, which houses the Museo Romantico.\n\nThe Museo Torres Garc\u00eda is located in the Old Town, and exhibits Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda's unusual portraits of historical icons and cubist paintings akin to those of Picasso and Braque. The museum was established by Manolita Pi\u00f1a Torres, the widow of Torres Garcia, after his death in 1949. She also set up the Garc\u00eda Torres Foundation, a private non-profit organization that organizes the paintings, drawings, original writings, archives, objects and furniture designed by the painter as well as the photographs, magazines and publications related to him.\n\nThere are several other important art museums in Montevideo. The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rod\u00f3 has Uruguay's largest collection of paintings. The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930, the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay, significant with regard to the fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes. In back of the museum is a Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp. The Museo de Historia del Arte, located in the Palacio Municipal, features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period. The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial, in the Ciudad Vieja, has preserved collections of the archaeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archaeologist Antonio Taddei. These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America, painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Museo de Arte Contempo has small but impressive exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture.There are also other types of museums in the city. The Museo del Gaucho y de la Moneda, located in the Centro, has distinctive displays of the historical culture of Uruguay's gauchos, their horse gear, silver work and mate (tea), gourds, and bombillas (drinking straws) in odd designs. The Museo Naval, is located on the eastern waterfront in Buceo and offers exhibits depicting the maritime history of Uruguay. The Museo del Autom\u00f3vil, belonging to the Automobile Club of Uruguay, has a rich collection of vintage cars which includes a 1910 Hupmobile. The Museo y Parque Fernando Garc\u00eda in Carrasco, a transport and automobile museum, includes old horse carriages and some early automobiles. The Castillo Pittamiglio, with an unusual fa\u00e7ade, highlights the eccentric legacy of Humberto Pittamiglio, local alchemist and architect.\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\n\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is home to a number of festivals and carnivals including a Gaucho festival when people ride through the streets on horseback in traditional gaucho gear. The major annual festival is the annual Montevideo Carnival which is part of the national festival of Carnival Week, celebrated throughout Uruguay, with central activities in the capital, Montevideo. Officially, the public holiday lasts for two days on Carnival Monday and Shrove Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, but due to the prominence of the festival, most shops and businesses close for the entire week.\nDuring carnival there are many open-air stage performances and competitions and the streets and houses are vibrantly decorated. \"Tablados\" or popular scenes, both fixed and movable, are erected in the whole city. Notable displays include \"Desfile de las Llamadas\" (\"Parade of the Calls\"), which is a grand united parade held on the south part of downtown, where it used to be a common ritual back in the early 20th century. Due to the scale of the festival, preparation begins as early as December with an election of the \"zonal beauty queens\" to appear in the carnival.\n\n\n==== Sports ====\n\nEstadio Centenario, the national football stadium in Parque Batlle, was opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay's first constitution. In this World Cup, Uruguay won the title game against Argentina by 4 goals to 2. The stadium has 70,000 seats. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums, along with Maracan\u00e3, Wembley Stadium, San Siro, Estadio Azteca, and Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. A museum located within the football stadium has exhibits of memorabilia from Uruguay's 1930 and 1950 World Cup championships. Museum tickets give access to the stadium, stands, locker rooms and playing field.Between 1935 and 1938, the athletics track and the municipal velodrome were completed within Parque Batlle. The Tabar\u00e9 Athletic Club is occasionally made over as a carnival theatre using impermanent materials.\n\nToday the vast majority of teams in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n come from Montevideo, including Nacional, Pe\u00f1arol, Central Espa\u00f1ol, Cerrito, Cerro, Danubio, Defensor Sporting, Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9nix, Liverpool, Wanderers, Racing, River Plate, Club Atl\u00e9tico Torque and Rampla Juniors.\nBesides Estadio Centenario, other stadiums include Estadio Campeon del Siglo, Pe\u00f1arol, Gran Parque Central, Belvedere, Complejo Rentistas, Jardines del Hip\u00f3dromo, Jos\u00e9 Pedro Damiani, \"La Bombonera\", Luis Franzini, Luis Tr\u00f3ccoli and the park stadiums of Abraham Paladino, Alfredo V\u00edctor Viera, Omar Saroldi, Jos\u00e9 Nasazzi, Osvaldo Roberto, Maracan\u00e1 and Palermo.\nThe city has a tradition as host of major international basketball tournaments including the official 1967 FIBA World Cup and the 1988 1997 and 2017 editions of the official Americas Basketball Championship.\nThe Uruguayan Basketball League is headquartered in Montevideo and most of its teams are from the city, including Defensor Sporting, Bigu\u00e1, Aguada, Goes, Malv\u00edn, Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tica, and Trouville. Montevideo is also a centre of rugby; equestrianism, which regained importance in Montevideo after the Maro\u00f1as Racecourse reopened; golf, with the Club de Punta Carretas; and yachting, with the Puerto del Buceo, an ideal place to moor yachts. The Golf Club of Punta Carretas was founded in 1894 covers all the area encircled by the west side of Bulevar Artigas, the Rambla (Montevideo's promenade) and the Parque Rod\u00f3 (Fun Fair).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChurch and state are officially separated since 1916 in Uruguay. The religion with most followers in Montevideo is Roman Catholicism and has been so since the foundation of the city. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montevideo was created as the Apostolic Vicariate of Montevideo in 1830. The vicariate was promoted to the Diocese of Montevideo on 13 July 1878. Pope Leo XIII elevated it to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese on 14 April 1897. The new archdiocese became the Metropolitan of the suffragan sees of Canelones, Florida, Maldonado\u2013Punta del Este, Melo, Mercedes, Minas, Salto, San Jos\u00e9 de Mayo, Tacuaremb\u00f3.\nMontevideo is the only archdiocese in Uruguay and, as its Ordinary, the archbishop is also Primate of the Catholic Church in Uruguay. The archdiocese's mother church and thus seat of its archbishop is Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n y San Felipe y Santiago. As of 2010, the current Archbishop of Montevideo is Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet, SDB, since his appointment on 11 February 2014.Other religious faiths in Montevideo are Protestantism, Umbanda, Judaism, and there are many people who define themselves as Atheists and Agnostics, while others profess \"believing in God but without religion\".\n\n\n==== Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral ====\n\nThe Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Roman Catholic church of Montevideo. It is located in Ciudad Vieja, immediately across Constitution Square from the Cabildo. In 1740 a brick church was built on the site. In 1790, the foundation was laid for the current neoclassical structure. The church was consecrated in 1804. Bicentennial celebrations were held in 2004.\nIn 1897, Pope Leo XIII elevated the church to Metropolitan Cathedral status. Important ceremonies are conducted under the direction of the Archbishop of Montevideo. Weddings and choral concerts are held here and the parish priest conducts the routine functions of the cathedral. In the 19th century, its precincts were also used as a burial place of famous people who died in the city. For decades, the prison and the nearby Punta Carretas parish church were the only major buildings in the neighbourhood.\n\n\n==== Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n ====\n\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (\"Our Lady of the Sacred Heart\"), also known as Iglesia Punta Carretas (\"Punta Carretas Church\"), was built between 1917 and 1927 in the Romanesque Revival style. The church was originally part of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, but is presently in the parish of the Ecclesiastic Curia. Its location is at the corner of Solano Garc\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 Ellauri. It has a nave and aisles. The roof has many vaults. During the construction of the Punta Carretas Shopping complex, major cracks developed in the structure of the church as a result of differential foundation settlement.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is the economic and political centre of the country. Most of the largest and wealthiest businesses in Uruguay have their headquarters in the city. Since the 1990s the city has undergone rapid economic development and modernization, including two of Uruguay's most important buildings\u2014the World Trade Center Montevideo (1998), and Telecommunications Tower (2000), the headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company ANTEL, increasing the city's integration into the global marketplace.The Port of Montevideo, in the northern part of Ciudad Vieja, is one of the major ports of South America and plays a very important role in the city's economy. The port has been growing rapidly and consistently at an average annual rate of 14 percent due to an increase in foreign trade. The city has received a US$20 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to modernize the port, increase its size and efficiency, and enable lower maritime and river transportation costs.The most important state-owned companies headquartered in Montevideo are: AFE (railways), ANCAP (Energy), Administracion Nacional de Puertos (Ports), ANTEL (telecommunications), BHU (savings and loan), BROU (bank), BSE (insurance), OSE (water & sewage), UTE (electricity). These companies operate under public law, using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called Ente Autonomo (\"autonomous entity\"). The government also owns part of other companies operating under private law, such as those owned wholly or partially by the CND (National Development Corporation).\nBanking has traditionally been one of the strongest service export sectors in Uruguay: the country was once dubbed \"the Switzerland of America\", mainly for its banking sector and stability, although that stability has been threatened in the 21st century by the recent global economic climate. The largest bank in Uruguay is Banco Republica (BROU), based in Montevideo. Almost 20 private banks, most of them branches of international banks, operate in the country (Banco Santander, BBVA, ABN AMRO, Citibank, among others). There are also a myriad of brokers and financial-services bureaus, among them Ficus Capital, Galfin Sociedad de Bolsa, Europa Sociedad de Bolsa, Dar\u00edo Cukier, GBU, Horde\u00f1ana & Asociados Sociedad de Bolsa, etc.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism accounts for much of Uruguay's economy. Tourism in Montevideo is centered in the Ciudad Vieja area, which includes the city's oldest buildings, several museums, art galleries, and nightclubs, with Sarand\u00ed Street and the Mercado del Puerto being the most frequented venues of the old city. On the edge of Ciudad Vieja, Plaza Independencia is surrounded by many sights, including the Sol\u00eds Theatre and the Palacio Salvo; the plaza also constitutes one end of 18 de Julio Avenue, the city's most important tourist destination outside of Ciudad Vieja. Apart from being a shopping street, the avenue is noted for its Art Deco buildings, three important public squares, the Gaucho Museum, the Palacio Municipal and many other sights. The avenue leads to the Obelisk of Montevideo; beyond that is Parque Batlle, which along with the Parque Prado is another important tourist destination. Along the coast, the Fortaleza del Cerro, the Rambla (the coastal avenue), 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) of sandy beaches, and Punta Gorda attract many tourists, as do the Barrio Sur and Palermo barrios.The Ministry of Tourism offers a two-and-a-half-hour city tour and the Montevideo Tourist Guide Association offers guided tours in English, Italian, Portuguese and German. Apart from these, many private companies offer organized city tours.\nMost tourists to the city come from Argentina, Brazil and Europe, with the number of visitors from elsewhere in Latin America and from the United States growing every year, thanks to an increasing number of international airline arrivals at Carrasco International Airport as well as cruises that arrive into the port of Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\nMontevideo has over 50 hotels, mostly located in the city centre or along the beachfront of the Rambla de Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nMontevideo is the heartland of retailing in Uruguay. The city has become the principal centre of business and real estate, including many expensive buildings and modern towers for residences and offices, surrounded by extensive green spaces. In 1985, the first shopping centre in Rio de la Plata, Montevideo Shopping was built. In 1994, with building of three more shopping complexes such as the Shopping Tres Cruces, Portones Shopping, and Punta Carretas Shopping, the business map of the city changed dramatically. The creation of shopping complexes brought a major change in the habits of the people of Montevideo. Global firms such as McDonald's and Burger King etc. are firmly established in Montevideo.\nApart from the big shopping complexes, the main retailing venues of the city are: most of 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro and Cord\u00f3n barrios, a length of Agraciada Avenue in the Paso de Molino area of Belvedere, a length of Arenal Grande St. and the\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nOut of the 100 radio stations found in Uruguay, 40 of them are in Montevideo. The city has a vibrant artistic and literary community. The press enjoyed full freedom until the advent of the Civic-military dictatorship (1973\u20131985); this freedom returned on 1 March 1985, as part of the restoration of democracy.\nSome of the important newspapers published in the city are: Brecha, La Republica, El Observador, El Pa\u00eds, Gaceta Comercial and La Diaria. El D\u00eda was the most prestigious paper in Uruguay, founded in 1886 by Jos\u00e9 Batlle, who would later go on to become President of Uruguay. The paper ceased production in the early 1990s. All television stations have their headquarters in Montevideo, for example: Saeta Channel 10, Teledoce, Channel 4 and National Television (Channel 5)\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte (DNT), part of the national Ministry of Transport and Public Works, is responsible for the organization and development of Montevideo's transport infrastructure. A bus service network covers the entire city. An international bus station, the Tres Cruces Bus Station, is located on the lower level of the Tres Cruces Shopping Center, on the side of Artigas Boulevard. This terminal, along with the Baltazar Brum Bus Terminal (or Rio Branco Terminal) by the Port of Montevideo, handles the long distance and intercity bus routes connecting to destinations within Uruguay.\n\nThe State Railways Administration of Uruguay (AFE) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the Empalme Olmos, San Jose and Florida. These lines operate to major suburban areas of Canelones, San Jos\u00e9 and Florida. Within the Montevideo city limits, local trains stop at Lorenzo Carnelli, Yatai (Step Mill), Sayago, Columbus (line to San Jose and Florida), Pe\u00f1arol and Manga (line Empalme Olmos) stations. The historic 19th century General Artigas Central Station located in the neighbourhood of Aguada, six blocks from the central business district, was abandoned 1 March 2003 and remains closed. A new station, 500 metres (1,600 ft) north of the old one and part of the Tower of Communications modern complex, has taken over the rail traffic.Carrasco International Airport (IATA: MVD, ICAO: SUMU), which serves Montevideo, is located 19 km (12 mi) from the city centre. Several international airlines operate there. The airport serves over 1,500,000 passengers annually. \u00c1ngel S. Adami Airport is a private airport operated by minor charter companies.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Montevideo, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 65 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 18% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.2 km, while 6% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nThe port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbour entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of R\u00edo de la Plata, Buenos Aires.\nThe main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, until the 21st century, physical changes had ceased, and since that time the area had degraded due to national economic stagnation.The port's proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.Every year more than one hundred cruises arrive, bringing tourists to Montevideo by public or private tours.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Public education ===\nThe University of the Republic is the country's largest and most important university, with a student body of 81,774, according to the census of 2007. It was founded on 18 July 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its current Rector is Dr. Rodrigo Arocena. The university houses 14 faculties (departments) and various institutes and schools. Many eminent Uruguayans have graduated from this university, including Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Jos\u00e9 Luis Massera, Gabriel Paternain, Mario Wschebor, Roman Fresnedo Siri, Carlos Ott and Eladio Dieste\nThe process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time.\n\n\n=== Private education ===\nThe largest private university in Uruguay, is also located in Montevideo. ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942, and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996, becoming the second private educational institution in the country to achieve that status. It is a member of World ORT, an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nThe university has about 8,000 students, distributed among 5 faculties and institutes, mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering. Its current rector as of 2010 is Dr. Jorge A. Gr\u00fcnberg.\nThe Montevideo Crandon Institute is an American School of missionary origin and the main Methodist educational institution in Uruguay. Founded in 1879 and supported by the Women's Society of the Methodist Church of the United States, it is one of the most traditional and emblematic institutions in the city inculcating John Wesley's values. Its alumni include presidents, senators, ambassadors and Nobel Prize winners, along with musicians, scientists, and others. The Montevideo Crandon Institute boasts of being the first academic institution in South America where a home economics course was taught.\n\nThe Christian Brothers of Ireland Stella Maris College is a private, co-educational, not-for-profit Catholic school located in the wealthy residential southeastern neighbourhood of Carrasco. Established in 1955, it is regarded as one of the best high schools in the country, blending a rigorous curriculum with strong extracurricular activities. The school's headmaster, history professor Juan Pedro Toni, is a member of the Stella Maris Board of Governors and the school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Its long list of distinguished former pupils includes economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school's alumni club.\nAlso in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo, one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, founded in 1908 with \"the object of giving children a complete education, both intellectual and moral, based upon the ideas and principles of the best schools in The British Isles\".\nThe School is governed by the Board of Governors, elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay, whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay. Prominent alumni include former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry Herr\u00e1n and Gabriel Gurm\u00e9ndez Armand-Ugon.\nLocated in Cordon, St.Brendan's school, previously named St.Catherine's is a non-profit civil association, which has a solid institutional culture with a clear vision of the future. It is knowned for being one of the best schools in the country, joining students from the wealthiest parts of Montevideo, such us, Punta Carretas, Pocitos, Malvin and Carrasco.\nSt. Brendan's School is a bilingual, non-denominational school that promotes a pedagogical constructivist approach focused on the child as a whole. In this approach, understanding is built from the connections children make between their own prior knowledge and the learning experiences, thus developing critical thinking skills. It is also the only school in the country implementing the three International Baccalaureate Programmes. These are:\n\nDiploma Programme \u2013 Pre-University course for students aged 16 to 19. The Diploma Programme is a two-year curriculum.\nMYP -Middle Years Programme. For students aged 12 to 16.\nPYP \u2013 Primary Years Programme. For students aged 3 to 12.Other educational institutions of note include Colegio Ingles, Instituto Preuniversitario Salesiano Juan XXIII, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Montevideo, Ivy Thomas, German School of Montevideo and Colegio Preuniversitario Ciudad de San Felipe.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nIn Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by polyclinics and hospitals or sanatorios. The term hospital is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while sanatorio is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.\n\n\n=== Public hospitals ===\nHospital de Cl\u00ednicas \"Dr. Manuel Quintela\" is a University Hospital attached to the University of the Republic, and is located on Avenida Italia. It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928\u20131929 and has a surface area of 110,000 square metres (1,200,000 sq ft) on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr. Hugo Villar, who was a considerable influence on the institution.\nHospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaran\u00ed and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of Jos\u00e9 Toribio (son of Tom\u00e1s Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaran\u00ed street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaran\u00ed and 25 de Mayo) and Juli\u00e1n Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Est\u00e9vez in 1798.Hospital Pereira Rossell was founded in 1908 and was built on land donated in late 1900 by Alexis Rossell y Rius and Dolores Pereira de Rossell. It was the city's first pediatric hospital, and shortly afterwards the addition of an obstetric and gynaecological clinic in 1915 made it the first maternity hospital as well. Later, the hospital received a donation from Dr. Enrique Pouey for a radiotherapy unit.\nHospital Vilardeb\u00f3 is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist Teodoro Vilardeb\u00f3 Matuliche, it opened 21 May 1880. The hospital was originally one of the best of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel. It has an emergency service, outpatient, clinic and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others. The average patient age is 30 years; more than half of the patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.\nOther public polyclinics and hospitals of note include the Hospital Saint Bois, founded 18 November 1928, which consists of a General Hospital and Eye Hospital; the Pasteur Hospital in La Uni\u00f3n neighbourhood; the Hospital Espa\u00f1ol, which was founded in 1886, passed to the private sector in the 20th century, closed in 2004 and was restored and reinaugurated in 2007 as the municipal Juan Jose Crottogini Polyclinic; the National Cancer Institute; and the National Institute of Trauma and Orthopedics.\n\n\n=== Private healthcare ===\nPrivate healthcare is offered by many private health insurance companies, each of which has one or more polyclinics and owns or is associated with one or more hospitals. Private medical facilities of note include the Hospital Brit\u00e1nico, the Italian Hospital of Montevideo, Mutualista CASMU's Sanatoria I, II, III and IV, the Evangelical Hospital, M\u00e9dica Uruguaya, Sanatorio de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, Sanatorios del C\u00edrculo Cat\u00f3lico, Sanatorio Casa de Galicia and Sanatorio GREMCA.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nMontevideo is twinned with:\n\nMontevideo is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities since 12 October 1982.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nAlbes, Edward.

        "wiki": "Cuisine of Montevideo refers to the food cooked and served in the city of Montevideo, Uruguay. The cuisine served in the city is similar to that consumed in the country as a whole with beef being a staple of the diet and found in a range of foods and torta frita,  a pan-fried cake. However, given the influx of immigrants and tourists into the capital over the decades and centuries, a range of cultural culinary influences can be found in the city.\nIn recent years the number of restaurants and diversity of cuisine has increased considerably, Lonely Planet describes the Montevideo culinary scene as \"just starting to get exciting\" with the variety of restaurants springing up in the city from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine and Middle Eastern cuisine. Restaurant Arcadia atop the Plaza Victoria on the 25th floor of the Radisson Montevideo Victoria Plaza Hotel is widely regarded to be the finest restaurant in the city.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nA torta frita is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the centre for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt. Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. Many of the restaurants serve beef steaks, pork or chicken dishes. Given that Montevideo is a coastal city, it is also provided by a plentiful supply of fresh fish which alongside beef and chicken is very important in the Montevideo cuisine. Some restaurants like Che Montevideo on the Rambla Gandhi in the Pocitos area of the city on the coast specialize in fresh seafood.\n\n\n== Mercado del Puerto ==\n\nThe centre of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto (\"Port Market\"). This complex contains a considerable range of restaurants and cafes. La Palenque restaurant serves Uruguayan and Spanish cuisine with a variety of lamb, pork and cold meats dishes with vegetables, paella, rice and shellfish. Additionally, the market is host to various cultural events on Saturdays.The Mercado del Puerto is the city's most famous area for parillas (\"barbecues\"). The open-aired building which houses the market was built in 1868. While originally a venue for fresh produce, it is now filled with parillas. The structure was built in the style of a nineteenth-century British Railway station. It is listed among \"The Best Markets\" in South America by Frommer's.\n\n\n== Restaurants ==\n\nMontevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine such as sushi. Western fast-food chains such as McDonald's, and  Burger King are  evident in the city, showing the forces of globalization.\nThe Restaurante Arcadia, on the 25th floor of the Radisson Montevideo Victoria Plaza Hotel\nis considered Montevideo's best restaurant.Arcadia is set in a classic Italian-inspired dining room and serves lavish dishes such as terrine of pheasant marinated in cognac, grilled lamb glazed with mint and garlic, and duck confit on thin strudel pastry with red cabbage.El Fogon is more popular with the late-night diners of the city. Its interior is brightly lit and the walls covered with big mirrors. Officially a barbecue and seafood restaurant, it serves grilled meat dishes, as well as salmon, shrimp and calamari. Also of note is the Cru. Numerous restaurants are located along the Rambla of Montevideo.\nKokoro is a Japanese restaurant located on Viejo Pancho in the barrio of Pocitos. It serves traditional Japanese cuisine, mainly dishes with meat and fish to suit the Uruguayan palette. Its dishes range from appetizers such as a dumpling of salmon and nira, to Sauteed whitefish with Teriyaki sauce and white rice to rolled sushi and sashimi and Japanese curry and rice with Wagyu (beef) or chicken. Deserts include green tea ice cream and apple rolls.Kazbah is Middle Eastern restaurant located on the Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre. It serves dishes such as falafel, schwarma (doner kebabs), couscous and tagin.Panini's is a notable Italian restaurant located in the Ciudad Vieja historical area of the city, just off the Plaza Independencia, and is testament to the influences of some of the Uruguayan Italian immigrants. It is noted in particular for its \"degustaci\u00f3n de pastas\", described as \"a veritable smorgasbord of noodley delights.\"Also of note is Rara Avis in the east wing of the Sol\u00eds Theatre, a branch of the Uruguayan chain of restaurants called La Pasiva in the Centro area which serves pastas and meat dishes, and the restaurants in the Mercado del Puerto and the Mercado de la Abundancia.\n\n\n== Bars and pubs ==\n\nMany of the notable bars in the city are located in the barrio of Pocitos near the sea. Amongst these pubs of note include the \"Tibet Pub\", \"La Estada\", \"La Vuelta\" and the \"Rosh Bistr\u00f3 Bar\".\nMany bars and pubs are located inside community markets. Customers at markets may sit at bars to order sausages, offal, asado, and other meats that are being grilled right in front of them. Meats, especially cheap cuts of beef and pork such as sausages and organs, are a large part of the ordinary diet in Montevideo. The various meats are served with simple side dishes such as crusty bread, tapenades, fried potatoes, and tapas. During lunch, local lager beer is the most common choice of accompaniment, although soft drinks such as colas are widely available. In addition to having bars and pubs, markets in Montevideo also sell fresh produce, mate, coffee, kitchen ware, and other basic consumer goods.\n\nIn the old area of the city or the immediate surroundings notable pubs include the \"Shannon Irish pub\" and \"Chains Pub\". The Shannon Irish pub in the Old City area of the city was established in 2001. It is located at Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre 1318, 2 blocks from the Plaza Independencia and 1 block from the Plaza Matriz. Bradt Travel Guides says \"An Irish pub on Montevideo's liveliest pub street, with a wide range of beers (although Uruguayans find it hard to understand why an Irish pub doesn't serve Irish coffee).\" The pub is an important centre for Irish Uruguayans, often featuring live music. The pub serves traditional Irish whiskey by Jameson (1780), Paddy (1779), Powers Gold Label (1791), Bushmills (1608), Redbreast, Ballantine's (1827) and others and mainly sandwiches and fajitas.\n\n\n== Former world record barbecue ==\nOn the 13th of April 2008, twelve thousand five hundred cooks in Montevideo together grilled 12 tonnes (26,500 lb) of beef, setting a new Guinness world record. The event required a grill nearly 1.6 km (1 mi) long and 6 tonnes of charcoal. The barbecue bested the previous record of 8 tonnes, which was set by Mexico in 2006. Montevideo's record held until March 2011, when 13.713 tonnes (30,232 lb) of beef were grilled in General Pico in Argentina.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nVamos a comer / Let\u2019s eat, by The American Women\u2019s Club of Montevideo. 1995.\nARCIA, M.

          "This was the only lively place in town as we were here on a Sunday. I was great to wander around the market with stalls on the outside and all the BBQ's on the inside. I was amazing to see all the meat being cooked on the different types of BBQ",
          "We didn't buy anything but rather just watched everyone else shop. The attraction here to my eye is the architecture itself. Fun place to hang around for a bit and immerse yourself in local goings on. With a health helping of tourists!",
          "I am a lover of the market food, especially in Latin America. So we tried this one. Although is near of the port, you don\u00b4t feel a marine atmosphere like Santiago Chile Market or Canton. Is Uruguay, and is meat. After had a search in the different store looking souvenirs, we",

          "The building is a piece of wonderful old municipal architecture with lots of exposed wrought ironwork internally. Today it functions as a dining venue and contains a selection of bars and restaurants. The fit out is very sympathetic and the space has a pleasant ambience. Sadly,",
          "Very picturesque place to visit. Interesting shops and restaurants. A little pricey at the port, better to walk a little further",
          "This is the first time visiting this market place and the overall experience was average! Several vendors in the area! Some vendors were willing to negotiable the price of various goods. Also various restaurants are in the area as well!",
          "large number of stores and stalls, right in the port area; easily accessed from cruise ships; some good deals available.",

          "If you come to Montevideo you really must visit to Fort market. We had a terrific lunch at La caba\u00f1a Veronica. You might consider ordering one of their plates to share because they give you so much meat you might want to share it with someone.",
          "This is a very busy tourist trap area which is especially busy when there\u2019s a cruise ship in port as they are docked right across the street. In the big indoor area there are loads of restaurants all jostling for customers. The place was so noisy it was hard to hear. There was",
          "We really enjoyed wandering around this market while touring the old town. Lots of restaurants and souvenir shops. Very busy when we were there as a cruise ship had arrived and I think the market is their first shore excursion!!",

          "I expected to find a market filled with interesting foods and products. Instead, I managed to endure less than 10 minutes in this small space where there is only one type of food available. The ridiculous amount of asados being prepared fills the space with the stench of animal",
          "People trying to lure tourists into their restaurants as soon as you walk in. I am not sure how was it before Bourdain's show but other comments suggest he popularized it and it has gone downhill since. Ok to visit as concept is interesting but if one steers away from it, it",

          "This place opened in 1868 as the main produce and meat market of the city. Today is is full of restaurants, from fast food to full meals. The structure is made of cast iron. It is fairly close to the city's cruise ship terminal. The hucksters for the restaurants can be a bit",

          "The mercado is ever changing but still a must visit for me. Some parillas have closed in lieu of burger bars but that is just evolution. I love burgers also. There are still good parillas and lots of fun to be had even if some of the crowd has relocated",
          "Pretty expensive for food compared to argentina and average service. Not really worthwhile checking out",
          "As you leave renter the cruise port, don\u2019t fail to do into the Mercado to enjoy the tastes, sights, smells. Locals and tourists both come here. Eat at El Palenque! We dream of it even today!",
          "Amazing place with good food. They have a lot of options of restaurants to eat and all of them were packed but totally worth it!",
          "I went there really looking forward to seeing an authentic market with many food stalls selling diferent kinds of Uruguayan foods like cheeses, empanadas, vegetables, etc but what I found was a food court with very overpriced parilla restaurants and a couple of souvenir stores.",
          "It doesn\u2019t look too impressive from outside but once inside; one can find decent souvenir shops and several fancy restaurants. There are couple informal places which many people were eating empanadas. It didn\u2019t t stop there but found a restaurant which had a second level. I",

          "Of course, one must visit Palenque, and sit at the counter as close to the grill man as is possible to enjoy the \"grilling ballet\" and the grill master and the waiters intertwine and graciously avoid collision as the food orders are executed. Please note that the bulk of the",

          "A small ancient market in front of main port. it is a nice place to have contact with local food close to downtown Montevideo. Of course, meat is the specialty here. You can enjoy the smell of grilled meat long before arriving in the market. Not as pricy as I expected. Worth the",
          "Formerly a train station, this bustling and energetic market is a one stop shopping place for souvenirs, music, wine and more. You can experience the famous BBQ parrilla where meat is king. Uruguyans take their meat seriously here. Bring your sense of humor to deal with the",

          "The Mercado del Puerto is a thriving, bustling, fun mixture of restaurants, souvenir shops, stalls and lots of music, especially on the weekends during the afternoon. Most of the people who work there seem to be having a lot of fun (at least they were each time I was there).",
          "This market is worth visiting both for the interesting old iron construction of the building and for the many barbecue restaurants there. It has been called a Disneyland for meat eaters with good reason. Though I do not eat red meat most restaurants serve several barbecue",
          "On our recent visit to Montevideo we visited the mercado del Puerto.it is a good place to have a taste of charcoal meat, characteristic of Uruguay.If you wander around the place you will be approached by many restaurant's waiters trying to persuade you to visit their",
          "Our guide said we were stopping here at the \u201cmall\u201d to use the toilets and have 45 minutes for shopping. The building is an old steel structure that apparently had been a marketplace in earlier days. The inside was nothing like I expected. There were some clothing and souvenir",
          "Awesome little conglomerate of amazing restaurants and street vendors. It was a bit more scale than I expected.",
          "It seems like all the traditional latin america markets with good restaurants, some different products and expensive \"regalos\". But you might go there",
          "Close -easy walking distance -from the cruise port entrance, this is a riot of sounds and smells, and the sheer choice of eating opportunities is amazing (which is frustrating when all your food and drink is waiting for you on board!). As usual sensible precautions to be taken",
          "Great service especially if you can speak a few words (please and thank you) in Spanish and if you have a sense of humour!",
          "The Market is full of Meat Restaurants and the smell of the Barbecuing draws you into the place. It is bustling and noisy inside as practically every restaurant is busy. It is a great way to sample Uruguayan Culture by just walking around but the smells of the delicious meats",
          "Really great place with some of the best eateries in town. Great atmosphere. A must visit place on your stay in Montevideo. Not Cheap. But the food was brilliant",
          "Close to the waterfront - you can't miss this food-heaven and especially not if you are a meat lover. The best meat in town can be found here. Excellent restaurants.",
          "This place is meant for tourists from cruise ships. Very crowded, expensive and hot. We chose different place (Es Mercat) for lunch and definitely were very happy about our choice.",
          "A place to be visited. Choosing among all offers that option that is most enjoyable for you, you will for sure have a nice lunch, dinner... Could it have become a bit too nosy and not so cosy anymore ?",
          "Amazing place in Port of Montevideo, Awesome food is everywhere around here , and you can choose lots of places. Seafood , anykind of meat is available for most demanding hungry tourist around here. Everything out there is worth of trying. Is a bit pricy, but when you taste",
          "What a disappointment, perhaps my own fault because I had high expectations. A collection of overpriced eateries in a classical market setting that makes you wonder what it must've looked like in its heyday. Glad I've been, but the Mercado Viejo in town has a much better",
          "We had lunch here on two days. The atmosphere is great - it is a very vibrant and colourful place. The meat stalls are amazing and they have great wines too. We were on a RTW trip and this is one of our favourite memories.",
          "This is located just opposite the cruising pier There are beautiful artworks from local,T shirts ,key chains,necklace,and of course soccer souvenirs It is accompanied by restaurants which serve steaks, but we found the buildings are hot to go inside due to the heat,open flame",
          "We enjoyed walking and taking in all the different open cooking restaurants, very different from anything we've seen before on our travels, we enjoyed a drink on the inside only, as the inner part was to hot for us!!!! with all the cooking going on!!!! There's also restraint on",
          "There are so many different places to eat inside and out. All kinds of different things to eat. All serve cold beer. Some speak some English. We have tried 3 different restaurants so far. Well worth taking the time to stop. There are also small stores inside and out.",
          "The Mercado is a go-to location for visitors looking for Uruguayan gifts. Offers several shops and restaurants. You don\u2019t need much time here but if you\u2019re in Montevideo, you\u2019ll definitely want to stop by.",
          "As a nice place to know and get acquainted with the uruguay culture. The building is an old construction close to the wharf/port area that agregates a number of \"parrillas\" run by each of the restaurants owners. In my opinion the food is ok but not the best you can find in",
          "We had a great parrilla at the Mercardo. It is a hopping old market filled with restaurants, catering to tourists and locals. We sat at the bar of one of the restaurants as we watched the chefs create salads and deserts. We were served perfectly cooked meats and vegetables. I",
          "Having visited other Parrillas in Montevideo, in Colonia del Sacramento and in Buenos Aires; the Parrillas in the Mercado del Puerto seem to only offer a facade of what I imagine once was. Overpriced and overrated food.",
          "I liked this place very much! It is the real heart of Montevideo :). Full of barbecue restaurants, bars, must visit this place when you are in Montevideo. We had very good lunch there, but you must wait little time for free place to sit. :)",
          "It was a great experience to see how they prepare the food in the fire. The restaurants serve lots of meat, but I'm vegetarian and I found lots of vegetarian options too like veggie skiwers, grilled potatoes with Roquefort, empanadas, etc and don't forget the Alfajores for",
          "This place is a homage to meat, there are grills everywhere, meat being roasted and barbecued, but I wanted to take a look at the place because it's such an iconic destination here. The waiter didn't seem to have judged me when I said I was vegetarian and he offered me a variety",
          "Located across from the port this place a great secret lol Anthony Bourdain loves it and it\u2019s a real place. Food, and lots of other things like souvenirs etc. The kids where in awe the adults were fascinated by our local exposure to Uruguayan culture. A must see",
          "If you love to eat meat, this is a must. Uruguayan beef is great and here you can find lots of options. I can recommend especially you to try meat by-products, something not very eaten in other countries but in South America really know how to do it. Give it a try to",
          "This is the place to go for a taste of local culture. All 5 senses will be put to the test as you smell the meat roasting, hear the locals, touch the produce, see the colors, and talk to the people. We had lunch here and the options are endless. Also outside of the market you",
          "Anthony Bourdain called this place \"Meatopolis\" and he was right. Just lots and lots of meat restaurants all trying to get your business. Pretty amazing.",
          "The smell when you enter - as bbq from heaven. Here you can find a range of different restaurants/parillas which are eager to make a better bbq than the neighbours. Everything is loud, service staff working as fast as they can but if you come exactly at high lunch there will",
          "There is nothing actually from a market, just restaurants, all of them for tourists with high prices for anything you order.",

          "The meat from the traditionel Uruguayan grill is not to compare with anywhere else in the world (at least where i have been). The prices are alright, the atmosphere is nice and the food is amazing!! A must to visit Mercado del Puerto when visiting Montevideo.",
          "First of all this was not a mercado(market) it is an old market building consisting of various restaurants. Food is excellent. It is really there for tourists and of course people from cruise ships. On whole though it well worth a visit.",
          "If you come to South America thinking about eating good meat, this is the place to go. You will see the typical \"parrilla\" (grill) and taste good local products in a lively setting. You might even have the chance to listen to some local tango singers or other musicians while",
          "This market is fantastic. Just the right amount of smoke in the air bringing flavor to life. Noisy in a great way and wow is the food delicious. Only open for lunch but you can walk through and scope out where you want to eat in the morning.",
          "Unfortunately closed on the Sunday evening when looking for a meal., however did visit to have a quick look around after friends described it and is a great concept. Lots of outlets with a variety of menus. Smell great from the open fires & cooking. Will definitely eat here on",
          "Excellent place for have a good meals and drinks. Typically Uruguay. You can find meat, seal food, and others kinds. Beers, Wines and everything. You can miss this place!",
          "Just a small, old and closed marketplace full of meat restaurants for tourists... Looks old, feels old... Did not like the place.",
          "Lots of restaurants and gift stores , lots of artesanal and typical stuff. The medio y medio is a very nice typical beverage, you can be carried on.",
          "Absolutely overrated place. Worst service ever in every restaurant. Inflated prices. Shameful to recommend this.",
          "The market is quite touristy, but it has a huge selection of meats and a great vibe. It\u2019s worth checking out for sure!",
          "Awesome ambiance and food variety...well worth it if you like meat, beef, pork, poultry, fish, desserts and drinks....vegetarian available but mostly wood grill ....I love it here. Try Casa de Veronica for a full authentic experience...no economical options at this market.",
          "Mercado del Puerto is a tourist trap, it is kind of a meat temple with parrillas restaurants everywhere, the problem is the price of each meal. The service is horrible and the attendants don\u2019t seem to be very comfortable working at those restaurants. Do not expect a special",
          "There are a lot of restaurants here that offer good food. The prices are a bit higher than other areas though.",
          "During our stay we visited several times to different establishments. Every meal was delicious and freshly cooked with pleasant waiting staff. I read reviews and some stated it was pricey by South American standards but it was worth it. There was a good variety of meat options",
          "The market is host to a number of grill restaurants serving up a variety of grilled meats. It's rightfully been described as a carnivore's paradise! We chose La Chachra to dine and it turned out to be a good choice. The service was excellent and the meats were grilled expertly.",
          "Great places to eat, though. More options such as, with typical fruits and sauces should have been good.",
          "All over in the area you will find restaurants with great food. Prices are also very good and pealsant. Services fine all over",
          "Tipical place in Montevideo, full of history and tradition. You will eat good meat and uruguayan specialities grilled in front of you. You can see how they cook it. Recomend to eat inside the market in one of the little places where you can sit in the bar. I not recomend the",
          "Great place to eat good food and beer. Amazing people and place. I recomend this Place at all. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42",
          "While there is much more on offer than meat, it is clearly the star of the show amongst the restaurants vying for your attention in this very old market hall. Wander through the entire building before deciding what appeals to you. I settled on a bar seat at Caba\u00f1a Veronica and",
          "Worth a visit even as a tourist. Typical South American grilled meat restaurants where you sit around and watch the meat being cooked. Don\u2019t recommend for vegetarians or in animal rights",
          "Definitely visit the market. There are loads of choices of places to eat. We really enjoyed it. We ate at la palenque which was great. Loved the way the food is cooked.",
          "If you choose to have the most complete barbecue with the best meat in town you may stop by the famous \u201cMercado del Puerto\u201d ( the \u201c Harbour Market\u201d) where you will find the most complete restaurants ( more than 25 ) with the most significant offer related to meat High rate",
          "If you want to have a different barbecue, watching the grill close, in a high chair, it probably has some very good meats. As a market it\u2019s a bit disappointing.at least a good alfajor\\dulce de leche store close...",
          "Forgot which place exactly I went to eat but I have to say that products are kinda overpriced and not tasting as good as expected. Wines aren\u2019t too expensive tho and staff was always alright and agreed to help us with settling the bill half in cash and half in card as we had to",
          "Allows for a glimpse into the past of the port with the old customs house converted into a covered market with artesanal products and crafts and a few good restaurants. Even locals love it.",
          "The market is exceptional if you want to eat meat. Nevertheless, three people in my family are vegetarians. You can only find meat restaurants and a few gift stores. I would therefore only recommend this place if you intend to have a typical uruguayan barbeque lunch.",
          "This public market is not very big, but have places for many kind of budgets. The main advantage is that is located at the ciudad vieja.",
          "My walking tour ended here and over the years, I have grown wary of tours that frequent anywhere that sells wares. So initially, I was not going to buy anything in here. I spent enough time checking out the artistry of the building and making note of the prices so I could",
          "The Mercado del Puerto is a place with many restaurants. Meat, fish, chicken, all sorts of meals. We had a delicious rib barbecued for us! It worth the time and the money!!!",

          "Mercado del Puerto is a cool place to check out and look around. There are stores, merchants, and restaurants. There are lots of things to see, buy, and eat, however its a big tourist trap because it\u2019s near where the cruise ships arrive. It\u2019s overpriced, yes, but definitely do",
          "Visited the Mercado del Puerto in April, the smell of the food being cooked and the atmosphere of the place , not too crowded with people at the time, made this place a must ! The food was excellent and really enjoyed our visit.",
          "Una vez fue y yo pagaba con tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito. Volv\u00ed dos semanas despu\u00e9s con un amigo y el mesero dec\u00eda que necesitamos pagarle una propina seperada porque el propietario no le daba el dinero para sus servicios. Ya trat\u00e9 de pagar con tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito y no los aceptar\u00edan y",
          "The Port Market is well worth a visit as you stroll through the old city in Montevideo. It is full of BBQ eateries, seating inside and out served by different kitchens and BBQs. This is an afternoon lunch place and will close in the evening. During our walking tour we went",
          "Old world charm, excellent dining options, bars, nice little shops, vendors, & carts. Food prices are very reasonable for the quality! Most restaurants there accept credit cards and paying with a foreign credit card will save you 18% on your bill. (VAT refund). Be sure to",
          "We read about it on a blog and wanted to have a look, as we were 2 days in montevideo and wanted to see as much as possible, this was a great start of our South American trip. Never saw that much meat in one place and even more, the way how they prepared it was just incredible.",

          "....do not miss it. As everywhere else: lots of local products. Besides seeing a lot of fish or fruit varieties I can't find at market place at home it is always interesting to compare the prices. We did not eat there and I regret it because food is always fresher, more tasteful",

          "It's clearly touristy although does get a local crowd and it can be a good place on the weekends, when other parts of Montevideo may be quiet - lots of souvenir stalls, musicians, and then a whole lot of bbq and seafood restaurants and their touts. Check reviews first - the one",

          "The building is 150 years old, where the customs used to keep the goods. Nowadays it has many places where you can eat the best meat, parrillada, and also seafood, like paella. We use to visit every time we come Emilio's restaurant called L'Amittie. Everything what he cooks is",
          "One of the must stop by for lunch/snack stop. The market is small, but packed with tanalizing food stalls selling theri grilled cuts of meat. Come hungry because the sampler portions are huge! It is an authenic experience that one should not pass, After devouring you rmeat laden",

          "We didn't actually eat here but wished we had as the smells of grilling meat was delicious. Lots of smallish meat restaurants with some souvenir shops scattered in between. Very busy place with lots of tourists. The building itself is an old renovated meat market with iron",
          "This is the most traditional place to eat in Montevideo. It has a lot of restaurants where meat is the highlight, along with dulce de leite desserts. The architecture is also worth seeing. Some restaurants have a mezzanine, I highly recommend because of the view of the market.",

          "Yes you can get seafood here, or a beer, or buy some souvenirs, but this is the place to explore the Uruguayan love of grilled meat. If you are getting off a cruise ship it is very convenient - just a couple hundred yards up from the exit of the port complex. There are some",
          "Though we didn\u2019t eat here, we did enjoy the atmosphere and taking in the sights. It has a nice vibe to it here but was maybe a little on the touristy side and expensive. It\u2019s a busy place so be prepared for a lot of people!",

          "Loved this place! Has a great vibe - lots of barbecue places to choose from most with counter and table seating. I would expect to pay more here than in other places but worth it for the atmosphere. Queue up for an empanada while you are there - they are delicious!!",

          "Nothing really to see just maybe a lot of police in order to protect the tourists. Its visible that they are trying to clean it but it still takes time.",
          "So there are lots of meat restaurants in one plaza. They will shout out to you to come and eat at their restaurant. Walk around first. I was told the prices are very bad there as far as food goes but I did not think that the prices were too high. Good to check out.",
          "Lots of lunch restaurants to choose from, mostly steak. We had the empanadas from Carolinas, which is pretty famous. Then we came back at night and shared a ribeye steak. This is grass fed beef; very flavorful without a lot of fat.",
          "This was the highlight of my time in Montevideo. There are 7-10 parillas here with large grills and lots of action. You can sit at the bar where you can see them do all the grilling or sit at a table. This was my first Padilla and I didn't know what to do. I just took a seat",

          "Different grills will try to get you to try their cuts, pastas and traditional Chivito al Plato (steak sandwich). Most are good but the very best is La Chacra del Puerto (see separate review). The market has a very nice architecture and also sells some wine and other local and",
          "This market place is the most amazing assemblage of bars, restaurants, shops and atmosphere in all of Uruguay. The choice of places to eat is hard, but once seated at one of the many brasserie type barbeques you'll never forget the meal. Asado, the signature steak dish in",

          "No doubts it's still a \"must go\" tourist destination as the building is impressive, the environment is very nice, the staff interacts with you in many languages and everything works to ensure tourists have a good time. Exactly because of this, don't take it as the main reference",
          "This is the place with the best barbecue cooks in town, said our Hotel concierge. He also told us to order meat directly from the barbecue cook, avoiding all the extras that you pay while seating in a restaurant, but did not find a way to do that.",
          "This place is fabulous there are a multitude of restaurants to choose from and also lots of stores inside and around the Mercado Puerto. We visited 3 times in the month that we where in Uruguay. My mom and I went to the same restaurant and sat at the bar both times (women",
          "This used to be the fruits and vegetables market of the old town. Now it is the seat of a dozen of restaurants. They serve grilled beef and other types of meat. The location is nice, interesting, the food good, but the prices on the upper side for Montevideo. The old town is",
          "If you love meat and south american steak, this place is heaven. There are several restaurants inside so you can choose which one you prefer. But again, everything is about meat! I'm not sure if it's really 'local'. It feels like it's mainly for visitors which is not a bad",
          "Mercado del Puerto en Montevideo is a very interesting and fun place to visit. There are lots of shops and things to see in the surroundings, and the market itself is very colourful and inviting. There are many restaurants serving mostly \"parrilla\" meat. Some places are",
          "Great grill with variety of meats. The market is a hall full of restaurants. You can take a table or sit at the counter (we did). Its worth a visit especially if you walk through the city historical center and you finish there with a good steak.",
          "A great place if you are interested in food experiences-here you can try everything what is local and fresh. Quite similar to Markt Halle Neune in Berlin.",
          "Esto es una parrillada. Delightful uruguyan barbecue at a historical building at the harbour. Squids, fishes, shrimps, sausages and, of course, lots of meat, from the most unusual to the prime steaks. Delicious in every moment, and the main reason for visiting the area.",

          "My husband has family in Uruguay and whenever we visit, this is top on our list, as it was this time. I love to eat in the Mercado itself as opposed to the restaurants outside. I love sitting at the counter (just my preference), looking at the meat on the grill right in front",

          "We enjoy Mercado del Puerto by going to our favorite restaurants but recently they have opened several new shops featuring Uruguayan items. Hats, coats, scarves, wine etc., a great place to enjoy lunch, especially since the weather has not been the warmest.",

          "Great place to visit! Awesome restaurants, you have to eat at El Palenque. Interesting, fun & very Uruguayan style",
          "Mercado del Puerto is the first attraction travellers coming to Montevideo by ship will see. Therefore it is a very touristy place. It is picturesque and hosts many parillada restaurants, but I would not choose to eat there. There are many nice restaurants around which do not",

          "A mandatory stop in every trip to Montevideo, this is a picturesque place to visit, with a lot of parrilla (barbecue) available to see and appreciate. A typical beverage from Uruguay is famous in the market, the MEDIO MEDIO, a mix of 50% of white wine and 50% of champagne.",
          "We loved the atmosphere of this place at lunch. Lots of little restaurants crammed into this market building, cooking meat meat and more meat! The sights and smells were amazing. Great vibe, as there seemed to be locals and tourists alike eating here.",
          "If you want a nice and big meat to be prepared in front of you, definitely you wanna visit Mercado del Puerto. Constructed primarily to be a train station, the local became a food place with lots of nice restaurants. Worth the visit and the experience to eat in any of them.",
          "In short: The place for a good meat in Montevideo, BUT the service can be quite problematic! You have to \"fight\" to be serviced, and since they have so many people, it might take a while. But once you get to sit, and order, you'll taste great food. It is really overpriced, so go",
          "A place in need of renovation and just composed by restaurants: that is the Mercado del Puerto. Not to say that there are only restaurants, you find 2 or 3 souvenir stores inside but that's it. I really was expecting more attractions and things to see, maybe even to buy",
          "Loads of parrillas with high prices and smoke. Very friendly environment and picturesque. Must go but also try out some neighborhood parrillas.",
          "Sadly I came back too late to get a table for the daily feeding frenzy, however, earlier I had walked around and watched the preparation of the meat. If you enjoy markets and food preparation and meat you must come here.",

          "Anthony Bourdain called this place \"meatopia\", I call it \"carnivore heaven\"! You can't go to Montevideo and not spend some time strolling through Mercado del Puerto. The sights, sounds, and mostly the smells are mouth-watering. I don't think it matters where you decide to",
          "If you want to see people gathering in a informal way eating vorasciously beef, chicken, lamb and pork and all sort of sausages please go there and smell the food meters before entering. Good wines and beers too, and also fush and salads. Music is there and souvenirs. A 2 hs",

          "Housed in what used to be a fisherman's market is a beef bonanza, or a pork party if you will. Stop by one of the neighboring tourist shops or craft stands before you enter the realm of las parrillas. I had no trouble finding gluten and dairy free sides for my delicious hunk of",

          "Port Market is a must for any kind of meeting. Um ride can be for a business lunch, a lunch with family or a simple tourist walk. The main meal at various restaurants in this place is meat. Eating grills beside the fire and the beautiful smell the roast is fantastic! I recommend",

          "This place is kind of touristy, but the food is good and well priced (if you know what to order). I stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered chorizo and provoleta. The portions were good and the prices reasonable. For good cuts of meat, I would probably go to a parrilla in a",
          "OMG! This has been the best dining experience! What an amazing lunch. The meat was cooked to perfection. It was fun to watch the staff cook the meat.",
          "ask first if they have a covercharge and service charge - otherwise there can be a nasty sting in the bill",
          "These people love their barbecue. We have a three hour lunch so don't count on getting out of there quickly. Don't expect American style waiters rushing you for your order or your check. But the food and wine were fantastic",
          "An easy walk from independence square and well worth it. Really good photo opportunities and a busy place, really interesting to walk around. As I am a vegetarian there was not a lot of options here for me so we did not eat here. This place seems touristy but also has a lot",
          "We knew that Uruguayan beef was good, but add to it the ambiance of the Mercado del Puerto and the experience gets a kick up a few notches. A must visit when in Montevideo.",
          "This place is one of the most interesting in all of Montevideo, the restaurants are all similar so it doesn't matter which one you pick. If you like steak this is the place, they are really great and the experience is very fun.",
          "You can't miss the Palenque best meat there and one of the best in town. Best time is at midday. I believe it closed at night. Obvopiuosly go for the steaks and try molleja. Don't ask what it is jus ordr it, its partt of the cow... ENJOY,",
          "Delicious food!! Look for busy parillas. A must do when in Montevideo. Make sure to share if ordering a steak. Bife de ojo (rib eye) is particularly delicious. Over the weekend there is a wait...only at lunch. They do not serve dinner",
          "Walk down the main pedestrian street coming off of Independence Square. Turn rgiht at the end and walk down to the Mercado. not only is this great spot for meat and eats but this is a rapidly changing part of town you need to visit. Ten yerars from now it will be completely",
          "What can I say other then amazing!! Mercado Del Puerto (port market) is quite simply a dinning Mecca containing numerous parrilas. Upon entering we were confronted by the smell of meat in the air and the hustle and bustle of all the different restaurants within the small area",
          "Visiting Montevideo? This is a must go place. The barbecues offering all kind of cuts and vegetables. People from here and there. Sometimes a Cruise stopping by at the port, sometimes business men or football players, or even common people gathering for a nice piece of meat...",
          "What a place! Grill shacks all around and chefs who've cooked meat all their lives showing you how it's done. Food amazing scenery even more so.",
          "Warning - this place is CLOSED AT NIGHT! The market stall restaurants are closed at night and only a few restaurants outside the market are open at night. During the day however, this place is worth a visit. Great meat, although not a cheap eat.",
          "We went to the market for lunch.....I found that it was as much a feast for the eyes as it was for the stomach. All the restaurants were set up with the barbecues pits and all the food arranged ready to be cooked. Was fun to look at them and see how each was a little",
          "Enjoyed the day at the port and sitting down to an asado is a must. Plenty of restaurants to choose from. Only down side was the scarcity of public amenities in such a busy location.",
          "Due to location, this is often the first stop for tourists visiting Montevideo. The ambience is always vibrant and the service has been good for me everytime. Only thing I would say is that the food is very overpriced for what you get. In my opinion there are far better options",
          "In the middle of Ciudad Vieja, by the port, with pedestrian streets in the surroundings, Mercado del Puerto is an interesting view. Plenty of restaurants both outside and inside, the amazing smell of burning wood in the air and the chaos that outs to be called by several waiters",
          "This is a good place to go for a good meat meal.The food here is fresh the service is friendly. You can pick your choice after walking around.",
          "If you are walking around the old city in Montevideo, it will serve you well to walk towards El Mercado del Puerto! Plenty of different reataurants and authentic as it can be. Do you think they make good steaks in Argentina, check this place out!",
          "Go. Just go! This is my review - if you are a foodie/meat lover this is the place for you! GO!Heaven on earth - this is not an exaggeration! The smell is mouth watering and the food is to die for. Go!! P.s We ate at Estancia Del Puerto inside the market - incredible food, great",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you like steak and a good environment. Feels like you are in the ranch of ga\u00fachos in the old Montevideo city.",
          "This place is feast for the senses, vegetarians need not apply. The smell and smoke of parilladas can be well and truly before you even see the beautiful old building. Once in you become overwhelmed by the amazing smells of meats roasting. Eating venues are a plenty but as a",

          "I,m sorry for the couple that had such a bad time in el Mercado del Puerto. Their experience is the exception to the rule here. Ive been in Montevideo for the entire month walking the streets, taking buses, etc. and never had a problem. The Uruguayans are helpful and friendly",
          "Another must do in MVD! The building alone is a slice of UY/MVD history plus you can peruse shops and plenty of restaurants ( parrillas/ steakhouses). I had lunch at the outdoor bar at Palenque (small picanha & stir fry veggies w/ glass of Tannat) and had a wonderful time.",
          "I must warn unprevented tourists. I was told marvels about the place. In fact not only I was cheated I had to pay more than 130 bucks for a small piece ofgrilled beef but also sufferd a street robbery where my wife was injured. Three policemen watched doing absolutely nothing.",
          "I guess anyone should visit this if they wanted to say that know Montevideo. Plenty of tourists, meat, wine, medio y medio and meat again. However, this is not the only place for good meat and food in the city, believe me.",
          "The place is humming when a cruise ship is in so you may have to be aggressive getting a place to sit down. Numerous grills or parrilla serving up many cuts of meat and all excellently done. I had a plate of sausage and meat at Roll2. Mouth watering!!!",
          "Even if you don't love meat as much as Uruguayans and Argentines do, go for the experience of having a huge steak for lunch because it's just part of the culture. All of the \"restaurants\" inside seem pretty much the same and probably are, so we went with one that had a really",
          "Mercado del Puerto is a lovely place and a must visit in Montevideo. A bit pricey but the Adaso is delicious!",
          "The place is all prepared for tourists so that's way it's a little more expensive than the city average, but every single dish you ask will serve at least two very hungry people, so it's definitely worth. Depending on the day there are several talented street artists if you take",
          "Is a very turistic and peculiar place with many barbecue restaurants. Is an old warehouse that know is a barbecue market. I dont recommend eating there, most locals dont eat there because is expensive and not the best meat in town. Just visit it, take pictures and go. If you",

          "You dont have to have a map to find this place. j\\Just follow the smell or barbequed meat over firewood fires and you will find this place if you are around the harbour area. I have only tried 2 of the places inside but to me it looks like you cant really fail to get a good",
          "Not a real market, but rather a large building filled with restaurants.You can smell the grills from a couple blocks away and they smell wonderful. Upon entering, you'll notice each restaurant has a bounty of meats on large a central. We were served by a very nice gentleman! He",
          "For the local market I confess I expected more. It's just a place full of restaurants. We went there at lunch time and there were lots of waiters trying to nail customers. The smell of smoke is very strong everywhere. Besides the restaurants? nothing.",

          "My hotel was near this attraction. This complex of restaurants is open only during the days with things closing down around 5pm. Their main meal is early afternoon and it can be packed during this time. At night, it's a different story. My suggestion is that you walk around",
          "Great to sit at the bar while they BBQ these fresh cuts in front of you. Huge portion sizes and reasonable prices for such quality food. Delicious!",
          "The old port docks have been turned into a huge indoor market full of bars and restaurants. There are a few shops as well. The place is clean and is well decorated. This is a great place to have a meal or just have a drink.",

          "The place is an old market warehouse, with still and glass roof, filled in by lots of \"open air\" restaurants (meaning that inside the warehouse there are no walls and roof between one and the other restaurant) with gorgeous offer of grilled meet. Prices are reasonable, portions",
          "Very good food, particularly anything concerning \"asado\". Very nice to be outside, but be warned that it is definitely more expensive than inside. Best to reserve ahead of time during week-ends. Pleasant to take a stroll all the way to Plaza Zavala and back to walk off all those",
          "Got a mixed grill type but most of it was tripe and sweetbreads which were not the parts we wanted, The steaks looked nice, and our sausage, chicken and pork was sensational. The ribs were too fatty for my liking. I've had better for the price. Also don't split the bill if you",
          "There were lots of stores and restaurants in this area of Montevideo that is located in the old city. We had to walk through some streets that made me hold on tighter to my bag. But nothing happened...",
          "I must starting by saying: it's expensive! I, by myself, spent something around 700 pesos for a picanha beef with fries and a coke. Still, the experience is, indeed, amazing. You can't leave Montevideo without going there.",
          "Mercado del Puerto, located neart the port, in the old city, is a must go if you want to experience a local environment, eat uruguayan meat and have a glass of Tannat, the uruguayan grape. It is a tourist place, therefore a bit overpriced, but worth the visit.",
          "Great venue, classic old building, glass, cast iron, vaulted ceiling and dozens of charcoal bbq restaurants. Steaks, sausages, chorizo, chicken, prawns etc. We enjoyed ourselves a lot down here the beer was some of the best and coldest we have had in Sth America. The flavours",

          "Beef in South America are generally excellent. However our brief experience in Mercado del Puerto in Montevideo was quite disappointing. After shelling out US$50 for a plate of barbeque at one of the counters/bars, my wife and I could only shared a piece of sausage. The rest of",
          "It's s fantastic place for food, especially barbecued meats as the mercado is filled with them and packed with locals as well as cruisers. But, don't go for the shopping or to eat fish - we couldn't find either.",
          "Regretfully nothing has been done to improve this place, which is a very nice glass and iron construction but calls for urgent improvements. We've been there on a Saturday, and the place was crowded with tourists from a cruise ship as well as others that were spending the",
          "We ate at Roldos.We ask for chorizo, morcilla and ri\u00f1on, a ham and cheese sandwich and 3 sodas. Full of fat and tasteless. i ate some and started to feel sick. I didn`t finish. I left the place with $u800 less and starving. Never again!",
          "Great place to eat and very nice place outside and inside you can find places to eat typical port food and parrilla too",
          "This charming building of glass & iron is the old fresh-food market for the city. Although there are a few shops for tourists, most of what you find are restaurants cooking meat over hot coals: Here this is called Parilla. This way of cooking is the main cuisine for all of",
          "didn't eat lunch but it was an experience walking around seeing all the different types of meats ready to be grilled on large pit fires. Also are several good handicraft shops in the market and surrounding streets",
          "You can not go to Montevideo and not go to Mercado del Puerto! No matter if you eat meat or not, this market is a must in town. There are great restaurants that all offer the famous Parrilla, a typical Uruguayan barbecue you will never again forget. Great meat. Nice atmosphere.",
          "The market has a great atmosphere. Recommend timing your visit around lunchtime so you get a chance to enjoy a meal. Great lunchtime option if discovering/wandering the old town. If you're not hungry enough for a full meal I'd recommend picking up an empanadas from the small",
          "Nice place to have lunch if you are walking around the old city of Montevideo. We were there late (around 16:00) and the place seemed to be closing down. Nevertheless we had a nice lunch (seafood mainly). There are a lot of options and the atmosphere was very nice.",

          "This place is central to any trip to Montevideo. The open barbecues are amazing and depending where you eat, it can also be a cheap place. If you sit at a counter to eat, it is cheaper and then can see the cooks at work. However, more difficult to have a chat with friends as all",
          "One of the \"must do\" in Montevideo. Very good place to eat and buy souvenirs at the street. Some street arts are shown at the weekends.",

          "This lovely old building has been converted into a place to eat meat. there are over 20 restaurants each one boasting of having more cuts on the open hearth brazier than the next one. Some of the classier joints have added Lamb and suckling to the normal fare of beef. The locals",
          "Not sure why this is down as Shopping in TA - when we visited it late afternoon, it was all restaurants. We sat at the bar counter at Veronica's & watched it all happening. Scrumptious baby beef & grilled salmon thank you. Wonderful atmosphere. Yes, it's full of tourists, but",
          "The mercado is a cool place to walk through and maybe get a drink but I have not had good luck with the food there. If you're in Ciudad Vieja it is absolutely worth walking through but from my experience and that of friends is that all the restaurants are overpriced, the food",

          "Located at Cuidad vieja, it attracts turists like flies, and turists are treated like them. Overcharged dishes, only meat and french fries or unsalted rice. You have to pay IVA, service, bread...i asked for some salad and got a tomatoe, cut in 4 parts....not worth eating there,",
          "Great atmosphere with handicrafts etc, but lots of choice of food. Ate here twice and enjoyed both times. Once at a bar counter, and another with colleagues. It is touristy, but so pleasant and feels very authentic.",
          "There is less activity in Montevideo on Sundays compared to other days of the week. One place that has more going on Sundays is the Mercado del Puerto. Housed in an historic 19th century building, the structure itself presents an interesting sight itself. There is quite a lot of",
          "This place caters to tourists, but that being said, you do see a lot of traditional Uruguayan grills in the same place and it's interesting to watch and photograph. You can browse the menu of the various restaurants and there will be no shortage of waiters trying to persuade you",
          "the shopping is decent, but the food is outstanding! Come with an appetite and enjoy the delicious food. 10-12 restaurants with open grills and tons of meats being grilled. This was my favorite spot in Montevideo and a can't miss location while in the city.",
          "Mercado del Puerto is next to the Cruise Terminal and it is a must-see. There are plenty of little restaurants, most of them with just seats at the counter. You choose what you like and they cook it in front of you. Most of them are simple and delicious! The location is really",

          "Not expecting much in this touristy area, I was very pleasantly surprised by this collection of small restaurants serving asado and other specialties. Sit at the bar for huge steaks, fries, and local beer at great value! Don't speak Spanish? Just point to what you want to",

          "It's one of the postals of the city, a must go. A lot of stores, restaurants, people... But I must say: the food is very expensive and it's not worth it. If you want to have a good meal, go to one of the restaurants downtown, avoid the Mercado area. BTW, my friend got sick",
          "Well worth a visit even if you don't eat. Seeing and smelling that wonderful meat cooked on the open barbecues is an experience in itself. If you are a meat lover, this is paradise. It's reasonably priced and the quality of the beef in particular makes it a must do trip.",

        "wiki": "Carlos Thays (August 20, 1849 \u2013 January 31, 1934) was a French-Argentine landscape architect, and a student of French landscape architect \u00c9douard Andr\u00e9.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn Jules Charles Thays in Paris, France in 1849, Carlos Thays arrived in Argentina in 1889, after he was recommended by Jean Alphand to Argentine pioneer Miguel Crisol, who contracted Thays to design Sarmiento Park in C\u00f3rdoba. During his time in C\u00f3rdoba Thays became infatuated with the young country and decided to spend the rest of his life in Argentina. After moving to Buenos Aires he was named the city's Director of Parks & Walkways in 1891. This position gave him significant influence over the design of the city's open spaces, and his legacy is still strongly felt in the city's open spaces today.\nMajor projects included tree planting along streets, remodeling and designing public plazas and walkways as well as designing completely new parks and expanding older ones. Major parks and plazas that particularly show Thays influence on Buenos Aires include the parks Centenario, Lezama, Patricios, Barrancas de Belgrano and the plazas Constituci\u00f3n, Congreso, and Mayo. Thays' French heritage is reflected in many of his designs, in so far that Buenos Aires' parks and plazas are often compared to similar designs in Paris.\nOne of Thays' largest undertakings was the Parque Tres de Febrero, a sweeping area of open land covering several square kilometers filled with thousands of trees, flowers, many fountains, and monuments in the barrio of Palermo.\nA pet project of his was the Buenos Aires Botanical Garden, for which he petitioned the city government to set aside land (almost 8 hectares), which he designed in sections to display plants organised by continent, with a large section devoted to the native plants of Argentina, which were ignored in garden-making at the time. The garden has the first Ginkgo biloba planted in Argentina. Completed in 1898, it bears his name, the Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Carlos Thays de la Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires. One greenhouse, was first erected at the Paris Exposition of 1889 and brought in sections from France to be reassembled, one of five in the garden. A brick house in the English Gothic Revival style, in which he lived during the construction and planting of the garden, now houses the herbarium and a small botanical library.\n\nWhile Thays worked primarily in Buenos Aires throughout the years he also worked on many civic projects in other areas of Argentina, remodeling the Parque Sarmiento), C\u00f3rdoba, designing the Parque Urquiza in Parana, Entre Rios, Parque 9 de Julio in San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n, the Parque de la Independencia in Rosario, and the Parque San Martin in Mendoza. Thays also designed the grounds of the luxurious Club Hotel de la Ventana, near Sierra de La Ventana in Buenos Aires Province. Work outside Argentina included the urban planning of the residential neighborhood of Carrasco, aid in the planning of the Parque Rod\u00f3, and the design of the Plaza Cagancha and Plaza Independencia in Montevideo, Uruguay.Thays worked most extensively in Buenos Aires precisely at a period in the city's history where it was growing extremely fast as a result of immigration, especially from Spain and Italy. It is often noted that had Thays not insisted on high standards of design and frequent open spaces, many of the city's current open spaces would probably not exist.\nNext to the Perito Francisco Moreno and other prominent figures founded July 4, 1912 Boy Scouts Association of Argentina.\nThays died in Buenos Aires in 1934.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Four floors, small galleries, good introduction to Torres Garcia's artistry. Certainly not overwhelming in number, made up for by the lack of crowds. Great place for peaceful viewing.",
          "A classic and small museum located at the old city. You can spend a few hours and also visit other places in the old city.",
          "Museums are all free in Montevideo and Museo Torres Garcia is no exception. Best to take advantage of many of them on the same street/neighbourhood. Off a pedestrian walking street from Independza Square. Great museum exhibits, modern and their gift shop worth a visit.",
          "If I had only been able to see his works, I might not have come. But the exhibition by artists from the Chinese family Liu were much more my taste. (The website has lots of info.)",
          "I had seen some of his works before, but only a couple from a MOMA exhibition and they were in the 'universal constructivism' style. In this gallery there are 4 levels with different works on each level. It was very interesting to see the different styles he had painted",
          "It\u00b4s a must visit if one wishes to learn about Uruguayan art and its iconic painter Torres Garc\u00eda. It could make do with some refurbushing, without altering its original style.",
          "Over four floors, through narrative and artworks, the museum depicts the evolution of this talented avant- garde artist who constantly experimented in paintings, writings, and other art forms. Perhaps he might be described as the \u201cPicasso of Latin America.\u201d",
          "J.Torres Garcia was a Uruguayan painter who is best known as the founder of \"Constructive Universalism\". He painted in Europe, was friends with well known painters of the day, before returning to his native country. I could see the influences of Miro and Picasso . Regrettably,in",
          "We used the lift to get to the 5th floor and walked down each floor. The explanatory video about Torres Garc\u00eda was very good as was the main exhibition.",
          "The mural opposite the museum is an invitation to the collection. From figurative to abstract, spread out over 4 floors. This artist definitely deserves more attention from the international community.",
          "Another gem of a museum in Montevideo. On four floors you learn about his influential life and impact on art in Uruguay",
          "If you're struggling for some ideas about where to visit, why not pop in to this lovely boutique gallery set in a restored 3storey home & which tells of the life story and struggles of this interesting artist. To be honest I'd never heard of him but was glad that I took the time",
          "Naive art from early 20C - very typical of this 'experimental' time in art and just simply its not very good art",
          "This small museum is dedicated to one of Uruguay's most famous artists. Each of its three floors features a single gallery devoted to one period of his career. The more iconic images (those featured on tourist merchandise throughout the city) are to be found on the first",
          "I had seen the artist's work before and like it. So I was looking forward to seeing this gallery. It is good but I have seen bigger and better collections by this artist.",
          "Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda is one of the greatest Uruguayan artists and a pillar of Constructivism. The museum has an ample collection that covers all periods of the artist's life and the diverse paths that his creativity explored. A few meters from Plaza Independencia, at the edge",
          "Located on pedestrian street sarandi, near the Independence Square. It keeps in its collection the collection of the Uruguayan plastic artist Torres Garcia. It opens from Monday to Saturday from 10 to 18. There is also a small shop and art bookstore on the site.",
          "Great examples of Torres Garcia artwork. Wonderful colors and gift shop is attached. He had a unique style and one of his most famous works was an upside down South America.",
          "Obviously it depends on your appreciation of Torres Garc\u00eda's work but the size of the museum, the careful arrangement of the pictures the charts explaining the different artistic periods of the painter, the historic buidling... it all adds to a wonderful experience. This is a",
          "I went while in Montevideo for business. The museum has four floors and the entrance hall. The top two floors had an interesting local photography presentation. The two floors devoted to Torres Garcia showed the progression through different stages of work so there is not many",
          "Lovely small museum with 3 large galleries devoted to JTG. Only one had the famous constructivist paintings (saw more in BA) but still really nice. Bought a good wood toy which is a copy of his work. Surely worth a visit if you like 20th C art.",
          "It is nice to visit and see the kind of paintings that the artist did. Since Uruguay is a small and quite young country there are note spectacular museums.",
          "The hotel manager suggested this museum and so glad I stopped in. First off, the art is wonderful and varied. I would suggest taking the old time elevator to the 4th floor and then walking down the carved wooden staircase between floors. All the explanations are in Spanish, but",
          "I was looking forward to the museum because Torres Garc\u00eda is one of my favourite artists. I'm particularly fond of his semi-abstract cityscapes in red, blue, black and yellow, which are what I'm most familiar with. Sadly there are almost none of these in the museum, but it did",
          "If you enjoy 20th century art this is one of two museums to visit in Montevideo. Start here and then continue on to Museo Gurich (they are located close to one another, both on Sarand\u00ed) since Torres Garcia's influence is evident in the younger Zurich's work. I did not have any",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this art museum and it's gift shop. There is an interesting book store next door with an excellent restaurant on the second floor.",

          "My wife and I made a quick visit to Montevideo to check several places of interest to us and to sample the local culture and cuisine. Arriving around 9:30 am on the Buquebus fast boat from Buenos Aires, we quickly checked into our hotel in the old town and headed for our first",
          "Interesting museum but runs a little small. There are not a lot of Information about the artist of its time, influences, etc.",
          "And I was very excited to learn about a famous Uruguayan artist I had never heard of. He has lots of thoughtful toys, portraits and this wonderful exhibit of NYC that makes you feel transported back into the era.",
          "the museum concentrates around the work of the artist who might be a big name in Uruguay but not really well known outside. For art historians it might be interesting to look at the work and compare it to the developments outside of Uruguay though.",

          "it costs 100 peso to visit 3 rooms with paintngs of this artist I never heard of before.Some explanations in spanish, which I think could help understanding the artist and its art. Without the explanation, you see paintings and drawings, sometimes from the same period and",
          "This is a quick visit to see some work by one of Uruguay's notable artists. This small gallery is right off the pedestrian street, and is easy to find, and was one of the few places open during our visits to Montevideo.",
          "I must confess I knew very little of this important Uruguayan artist The building is not modern, but collection is impecable and museum assembled a very significant collection of his works presented in a didactic fashion You have the distinct feeling you have acquired some",
          "It is very small on 3 floors top floor is young artist but I discovered this Uruguay painter which has inspired a whole generation. Perhaps his best painting are at the musee de artes visuals. This museum allows you to learn about his life and the different epochs in his",
          "Torres Garcia is a great painter, possibly the best ever in South America. So we were nonplussed by this museum: very few canvas, a medioocre exhibit, housed in a place that stenches of mold.",
          "This was one of my favorite exhibits while in Montevideo, I'm a big fan of Torres' work so that heavily influences my opinion. While the exhibit is only in Spanish that didn't impact my ability to enjoy spending time viewing his works from various stages of his life.",
          "This museum off Plaza Independencia is an interesting one dedicated to the artist for whom it is named. It is interesting as much for the contemplation of the artist's words as it is for the art itself. The nominal entry fee is paid on the first level and the displays begin in",
          "This is a private museum in the old city devoted to a fascinating artist whose life spanned the first half of the twentieth century and was played out in Europe as well as his home, Uruguay. His ideas about art affected other artists and the education of children. It truly is",
          "Really enjoyed this - interesting to learn about such an important local artist and also gives you a better understanding of the art scattered around the city. However my boyfriend doesn't speak a word of Spanish and could really appreciate it so much - English information would",
          "Joaquin Torres Garcia was both an internationally known and trained abstract artist and an inspiring art teacher, whose pupils (and their circles) continue to influence art in South America. This museum displays a number of interesting works and provides some context to his",
          "A rare find in Montevideo, something cultural\u2026 the entry fee is low, the exhibit is pretty interesting, lots of \"filler\" to make it worth being called a museum of sorts\u2026 Two lines and a triangle don't make for the best art out there! You get what you can get in Montevideo...",
          "I wasn't crazy about the art work, it's not my style, but there are three floors, accessible by stairs, in an old building and you could spend an hour tops going through it. I didn't go in the first time that I went by it since it was full of school kids going on a tour.",
          "It deserves a visit if you are interested in art and history. Interesting paintings. Most interesting: photos of the artist and his familiy, in '20s and '30s",
          "A small museum, but quite a nice collection of Torres-Garcia's works. A reasonably thorough survey of his development and quite conveniently located near the entry to the Old City - certainly worth stopping in.",
          "Nice museum, well managed and cured. As it is named Torres Garc\u00eda works are shown, not necesarily the best but very representative of his work. Nice neighbourhood to go for a walk during the day.",
          "A great showcase of D\u00edaz Yepez, TG's son in law. Lift available only it's hidden by a sculpture and not indicated. 70 pesos entrance seems steep...",
          "The second and third floors of the building contains galleries of Garcia's works. Surprisingly there was little to see. And what was exhibited was not particularly interesting. Instead, my recommendation is to browse through the bookstore on the ground level and use your museum",
          "The museum has an intimate feel with a creaky wooden staircase leading to the two floors of the exhibition. There are not many works, but mostly very good ones that give great insight into a most interesting artist and his development over time. Along with the works - the",
          "I thought this museum provided an interesting perspective on Torres Garcia and the evolution of his style. The works are well presented. It's a pretty small museum, so an hour and a half is plenty to do the whole museum and gift shop. Well worth the time and entry fee.",
          "I first visited Museo Gurvich a little further down Sarandi by the church. I was very impressed with Museo Gurvich and had expectations that Museo Torres Garcia must be even better based on its outer appearance and location. Museo Torres Garcia doesn't even compare because it",
          "My favorite! Torres Garcia is an important uruguayan artist and the museum is very interesting!",
          "Drawings, toys, paintings from different periods. A small and very carefully arranged museum. For a complementary experience I recommend seeing the huge constructivist mural in ATYR, the social security office on the Plaza Matriz (in office hours - steps away from the restaurant",
          "This museum is located along the main pedestrian walkway in the Ciudad Vieja very close to the Plaza de Independecia so very convenient if your planning to visit the Old City.

        "wiki": "Montevideo (Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u03b2i\u02c8\u00f0eo]) is the capital and largest city of Uruguay. According to the 2011 census, the city proper has a population of 1,319,108 (about one-third of the country's total population) in an area of 201 square kilometres (78 sq mi). The southernmost capital city in the Americas, Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the R\u00edo de la Plata.\nThe city was established in 1724 by a Spanish soldier, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, as a strategic move amidst the Spanish-Portuguese dispute over the platine region. It was also under brief British rule in 1807. Montevideo is the seat of the administrative headquarters of Mercosur and ALADI, Latin America's leading trade blocs, a position that entailed comparisons to the role of Brussels in Europe.The 2019 Mercer's report on quality of life, rated Montevideo first in Latin America, a rank the city has consistently held since 2005. As of 2010, Montevideo was the 19th largest city economy in the continent and 9th highest income earner among major cities. In 2020, it has a projected GDP of $49.7 billion, with a per capita of $28,385.In 2018, it was classified as a beta global city ranking eighth in Latin America and 84th in the world. Montevideo hosted every match during the first FIFA World Cup, in 1930. Described as a \"vibrant, eclectic place with a rich cultural life\", and \"a thriving tech center and entrepreneurial culture\", Montevideo ranked eighth in Latin America on the 2013 MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.In 2014, it was also regarded as the fifth most gay-friendly metropolis in the world and the first in Latin America. It is the hub of commerce and higher education in Uruguay as well as its chief port. The city is also the financial hub of Uruguay and the cultural anchor of a metropolitan area with a population of around 2 million.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are several explanations about the word Montevideo. All agree that \"Monte\" refers to the Cerro de Montevideo, the hill situated across the Bay of Montevideo, but there is disagreement about the etymological origin of the \"video\" part.\n\nMonte vide eu (\"I saw a mount\") is the most widespread belief but is rejected by the majority of experts, who consider it unlikely because it involves a mix of dialects. The name would come from a Portuguese expression which means \"I saw a mount\", wrongly pronounced by an anonymous sailor belonging to the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes on catching sight of the Cerro de Montevideo.\nMonte Vidi: This hypothesis comes from the \"Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n\" (Navigational Calendar) of boatswain Francisco de Albo, member of the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes, who wrote, \"Tuesday of the said [month of January 1520] we were on the straits of Cape Santa Mar\u00eda [now Punta del Este], from where the coast runs east to west, and the terrain is sandy, and at the right of the cape there is a mountain like a hat to which we gave the name \"Montevidi\".\" This is the oldest Spanish document that mentions the promontory with a name similar to the one that designates the city, but it does not contain any mention of the alleged cry \"Monte vide eu.\"\nMonte-VI-D-E-O (Monte VI De Este a Oeste): According to Rolando Laguarda Tr\u00edas, professor of history, the Spaniards annotated the geographic location on a map or Portolan chart, so that the mount/hill is the VI (6th) mount observable on the coast, navigating R\u00edo de la Plata from east to west. With the passing of time, these words were unified to \"Montevideo\". No conclusive evidence has been found to confirm this academic hypothesis nor can it be asserted with certainty which were the other five mounts observable before the Cerro.\nMonte Ovidio (Monte Santo Ovidio), a less widespread hypothesis of a religious origin, stems from an interpolation in the aforementioned Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n of Fernando de Albo, where it is asserted \"corruptly now called Santo Vidio\" when they refer to the hat-like mount which they named Monte Vidi (that is, the Cerro de Montevideo). Ovidio (Saint Ovidius) was the third bishop of the Portuguese city of Braga, where he was always revered; a monument to him was erected there in 1505. Given the relationship that the Portuguese had with the discovery and foundation of Montevideo, and despite the fact that this hypothesis, like the previous ones, lacks conclusive documentation, there have been those who linked the name of Santo Ovidio or Vidio (appearing on some maps of the time) with the subsequent derivation of the name \"Montevideo\" given to the region since the early years of the 16th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBetween 1680 and 1683, Portugal founded the city of Colonia do Sacramento in the region across the bay from Buenos Aires. This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca of Portugal built the Montevieu fort.\nA Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were known as Guanches or Canarians. There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name of Jorge Burgues.A census of the city's inhabitants was performed in 1724 and then a plan was drawn delineating the city and designating it as San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo, later shortened to Montevideo. The census counted fifty families of Galician and Canary Islands origin, more than 1000 indigenous people, mostly Guaran\u00ed, as well as Black African slaves of Bantu origin.A few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the R\u00edo de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River, competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata brought it in confrontations with the city of Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was taken over to be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.\nIn 1776, Spain made Montevideo its main naval base (Real Apostadero de Marina) for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, Fernando Po, and the Falklands.Until the end of the 18th century, Montevideo remained a fortified area, today known as Ciudad Vieja.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nOn 3 February 1807, British troops under the command of General Samuel Auchmuty and Admiral Charles Stirling occupied the city during the Battle of Montevideo (1807), but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the same year on 2 September when John Whitelocke was forced to surrender to troops formed by forces of the Banda Oriental\u2014roughly the same area as modern Uruguay\u2014and of Buenos Aires. After this conflict, the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de El\u00edo opposed the new viceroy Santiago de Liniers, and created a government Junta when the Peninsular War started in Spain, in defiance of Liniers. El\u00edo disestablished the Junta when Liniers was replaced by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros.\nDuring the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo. During that year and the next, Uruguayan revolutionary Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain. In 1811, the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo, which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution. The siege was lifted at the end of that year, when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region.The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814. In 1816, Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821, it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil. It was named Imperial City by Emperor Pedro I when the city was part of the Empire of Brazil as capital of the Cisplatina province. Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the Treinta y Tres Orientales (\"Thirty-Three Orientals\") re-established the independence of the region in 1825. Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828, with Montevideo as the nation's capital. In 1829, the demolition of the city's fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja, referred to as the \"Ciudad Nueva\" (\"new city\"). Urban expansion, however, moved very slowly because of the events that followed.\n\nUruguay's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between Manuel Oribe and Fructuoso Rivera, the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the Empire of Brazil under the command of Lavalleja, each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction. Politics were divided between Oribe's Blancos (\"whites\"), represented by the National Party, and Rivera's Colorados (\"reds\"), represented by the Colorado Party, with each party's name taken from the colour of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the Guerra Grande, which lasted until 1851.\nThe city of Montevideo suffered a siege of eight years between 1843 and 1851, during which it was supplied by sea with British and French support. Oribe, with the support of the then conservative Governor of Buenos Aires Province Juan Manuel de Rosas, besieged the Colorados in Montevideo, where the latter were supported by the French Legion, the Italian Legion, the Basque Legion and battalions from Brazil. Finally, in 1851, with the additional support of Argentine rebels who opposed Rosas, the Colorados defeated Oribe. The fighting, however, resumed in 1855, when the Blancos came to power, which they maintained until 1865. Thereafter, the Colorado Party regained power, which they retained until past the middle of the 20th century.\nAfter the end of hostilities, a period of growth and expansion started for the city. In 1853 a stagecoach bus line was established joining Montevideo with the newly formed settlement of Uni\u00f3n and the first natural gas street lights were inaugurated. From 1854 to 1861 the first public sanitation facilities were constructed. In 1856 the Teatro Sol\u00eds was inaugurated, 15 years after the beginning of its construction. By Decree, in December 1861 the areas of Aguada and Cord\u00f3n were incorporated to the growing Ciudad Nueva (New City). In 1866, an underwater telegraph line connected the city with Buenos Aires. The statue of Peace, La Paz, was erected on a column in Plaza Cagancha and the building of the Postal Service as well as the bridge of Paso Molino were inaugurated in 1867.In 1868, the horse-drawn tram company Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tranv\u00edas al Paso del Molino y Cerro created the first lines connecting Montevideo with Uni\u00f3n, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro, at the time called Cosmopolis. In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras. During the same year and the next, the neighbourhoods Col\u00f3n, Nuevo Par\u00eds and La Comercial were founded. The Sunday market of Trist\u00e1n Narvaja Street was established in Cord\u00f3n in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, Bulevar Circunvalaci\u00f3n was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas, going up to the north end of the city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed to Artigas Boulevard (its current name) in 1885. By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area Los Pocitos was incorporated to the Nov\u00edsima Ciudad (Most New City).The first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas operated ones in 1886. The Hip\u00f3dromo de Maro\u00f1as started operating in 1888, and the neighbourhoods of Reus del Sur, Reus del Norte and Conciliaci\u00f3n were inaugurated in 1889. The new building of the School of Arts and Trades, as well as Zabala Square in Ciudad Vieja were inaugurated in 1890, followed by the Italian Hospital in 1891. In the same year, the village of Pe\u00f1arol was founded. Other neighbourhoods that were founded were Belgrano and Belvedere in 1892, Jacinto Vera in 1895 and Trouville in 1897. In 1894 the new port was constructed, and in 1897, the Central Railway Station of Montevideo was inaugurated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, many Europeans (particularly Spaniards and Italians but also thousands from Central Europe) immigrated to the city. In 1908, 30% of the city's population of 300,000 was foreign-born. In that decade the city expanded quickly: new neighbourhoods were created and many separate settlements were annexed to the city, among which were the Villa del Cerro, Pocitos, the Prado and Villa Col\u00f3n. The Rod\u00f3 Park and the Estadio Gran Parque Central were also established, which served as poles of urban development.During the early 20th century, Uruguay saw huge social changes with repercussions primarily in urban areas. Among these changes were the right of divorce (1907) and women's right to vote.The 1910s saw the construction of Montevideo's Rambla; strikes by tram workers, bakers and port workers; the inauguration of electric trams; the creation of the Municipal Intendencias; and the inauguration of the new port.In 1913, the city limits were extended around the entire gulf. The previously independent localities of the Villa del Cerro and La Teja were annexed to Montevideo, becoming two of its neighborhoods.During the 1920s, the equestrian statue of Artigas was installed in Plaza Independencia; the Palacio Legislativo was built; the Spanish Plus Ultra flying boat arrived (the first airplane to fly from Spain to Latin America, 1926); prominent politician and former president Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez died (1929); and ground was broken (1929) for the Estadio Centenario (completed 1930).During World War II, a famous incident involving the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee took place in Punta del Este, 200 kilometers (120 mi) from Montevideo. After the Battle of the River Plate with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy on 13 December 1939, the Graf Spee retreated to Montevideo's port, which was considered neutral at the time. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on 17 December. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. The eagle figurehead of the Graf Spee was salvaged on 10 February 2006; to protect the feelings of those still sensitive to Nazi Germany, the swastika on the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water.\n\nUruguay began to stagnate economically in the mid-1950s; Montevideo began a decline, later exacerbated by widespread social and political violence beginning in 1968 (including the emergence of the guerrilla Movimiento de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional-Tupamaros) and by the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985). There were major problems with supply; the immigration cycle was reversed.\nFrom the 1960s to the end of the dictatorship in 1985, around one hundred people died or disappeared because of the political violence. From 1974 another hundred Uruguayans disappeared also in Argentina. In 1980, the dictatorship proposed a new constitution. The project was submitted to referendum and rejected in the first polls since 1971, with 58% of the votes against and 42% in favour. The result weakened the military and triggered its fall, allowing the return of democracy.In the 1980s, Pope John Paul II visited the city twice. In April 1987, as head of state of Vatican, he signed a mediation agreement for the conflict of the Beagle Channel. He also held a large mass in Tres Cruces, declaring the cross located behind the altar as a monument. In 1988, he returned to the country, visiting Montevideo, Florida, Salto and Melo.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe 2002 Uruguay banking crisis affected several industries of Montevideo. In 2017, the city has maintained 15 years of economic growth, with a GDP of $44 billion, and a GDP per capita of $25,900.Montevideo has consistently been rated as having the highest quality of life of any city in Latin America: by 2015 it held this rank every year during the decade through 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMontevideo is situated on the north shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata, the arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the south coast of Uruguay from the north coast of Argentina; Buenos Aires lies 230 kilometres (140 mi) west on the Argentine side. The Santa Luc\u00eda River forms a natural border between Montevideo and San Jos\u00e9 Department to its west. To the city's north and east is Canelones Department, with the stream of Carrasco forming the eastern natural border. The coastline forming the city's southern border is interspersed with rocky protrusions and sandy beaches. The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbour, the nation's largest and one of the largest in the Southern Cone, and the finest natural port in the region, functioning as a crucial component of the Uruguayan economy and foreign trade. Various streams criss-cross the town and empty into the Bay of Montevideo. Its coastline near the emptying rivers are heavily polluted.The city has an average elevation of 43 metres (141 ft). Its highest elevations are two hills: the Cerro de Montevideo and the Cerro de la Victoria, with the highest point, the peak of Cerro de Montevideo, crowned by a fortress, the Fortaleza del Cerro at a height of 134 m (440 ft). Closest cities by road are Las Piedras to the north and the so-called Ciudad de la Costa (a conglomeration of coastal towns) to the east, both in the range of 20 to 25 km (16 mi) from the city center. The approximate distances to the neighbouring department capitals by road are, 90 km (56 mi) to San Jose de Mayo (San Jose Department) and 46 km (29 mi) to Canelones (Canelones Department).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontevideo enjoys a humid subtropical climate (Cfa, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). The city has mild winters (June to September), warm-hot summers (December to March) and volatile springs (October and November); there are numerous thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout the year, reaching around 950 millimetres (37 in).Winters are generally cool, wet, windy and overcast. During this season, there are bursts of icy and relatively dry winds of continental polar air masses, giving an unpleasant chilly feeling to the everyday life of the city. Frosts occur few times during winter, generally not falling below 28\u00b0 F (-2\u00b0 C) because of the oceanic influence that moderates the temperature; few miles away from the coast, frosts are more common and colder. Rainfall and sleet are a frequent winter occurrence, but snowfall is extremely rare: flurries have been recorded only four times but with no accumulation, the last one on 13 July 1930 during the inaugural match of the World Cup, (the other three snowfalls were in 1850, 1853 and 1917); the alleged 1980 Carrasco snowfall was actually a hailstorm.Summers are warm-hot and humid, with less wind than other seasons. During this season, a moderate wind often blows from the sea in the evenings which has a pleasant cooling effect on the city, in contrast to the more-severe summer heat of nearby cities like Buenos Aires. Heat waves come with the north winds, which bring humid and hot air masses from the tropical interior of the continent. These warm periods are usually followed by thunderstorms, generated by cold fronts of the southwest that lowers temperatures considerably. This phenomenon is regional, and can occur several times all year long.\nMontevideo has an annual average temperature of 16.7 \u00b0C (62.1 \u00b0F). The lowest recorded temperature is \u22125.6 \u00b0C (21.9 \u00b0F) while the highest is 42.8 \u00b0C (109.0 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions and barrios ===\n\nAs of 2010, the city of Montevideo has been divided into 8 political municipalities (Municipios), referred to with the letters from A to G, including CH, each presided over by a mayor elected by the citizens registered in the constituency. This division, according to the Municipality of Montevideo, \"aims to advance political and administrative decentralization in the department of Montevideo, with the aim of deepening the democratic participation of citizens in governance.\" The head of each Municipio is called an alcalde or (if female) alcaldesa.Of much greater importance is the division of the city into 62 barrios: neighbourhoods or wards. Many of the city's barrios\u2014such as Sayago, Ituzaing\u00f3 and Pocitos\u2014were previously geographically separate settlements, later absorbed by the growth of the city. Others grew up around certain industrial sites, including the salt-curing works of Villa del Cerro and the tanneries in Nuevo Par\u00eds. Each barrio has its own identity, geographic location and socio-cultural activities. A neighbourhood of great significance is Ciudad Vieja, that was surrounded by a protective wall until 1829. This area contains most important buildings of the colonial era and early decades of independence.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n\nThe architecture of Montevideo ranges from Neoclassical buildings such as the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral to the Postmodern style of the World Trade Center Montevideo or the 158-metre (518 ft) ANTEL Telecommunication Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the country. The Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the Palacio Salvo dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building facades in the Old Town reflect the city's extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the Legislative Palace, the City Hall, Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower. The most notable sports stadium is the Estadio Centenario within Parque Batlle. Parque Batlle, Parque Rod\u00f3 and Parque Prado are Montevideo's three great parks.The Pocitos district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the \"Edificio Panamericano\" designed by Raul Sichero, and the \"Positano\" and \"El Pilar\" designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis Garc\u00eda Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighbourhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle class residents.\n\n\n==== Palacio Legislativo ====\n\nThe Palacio Legislativo in Aguada, the north of the city centre, is currently the seat of the Uruguayan Parliament. Construction started in 1904 and was sponsored by the government of President Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. It was designed by Italian architects Vittorio Meano and Gaetano Moretti, who planned the building's interior. Among the notable contributors to the project was sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni, who contributed numerous reliefs and allegorical sculptures.\n\n\n==== World Trade Center Montevideo ====\n\nWorld Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998, but work was completed in 2009. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998. It has 22 floors and 17,100 square metres of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and 27,000 square metres (290,000 sq ft) of space. The 6,300-square-metre (68,000 sq ft) World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a centre of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St. Among the establishments on the plaza are Burger King, Walrus, Bamboo, Asia de Cuba, Gardenia Mvd, and La Claraboya Cafe.\nThe Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social place. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor Pablo Atchugarry. World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and 53,500 square metres (576,000 sq ft) of space is under construction as of 2010.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications Tower ====\n\nTorre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the 158 metres (518 ft), 37-floor headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company, ANTEL, and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect Carlos Ott. It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by American Bridge and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.\nWhen its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40 million, plus US$25 million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65 million price into US$102 million.\n\n\n==== Ciudad Vieja (Old City) ====\n\nCiudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent barrio of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and night-clubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.\n\nMontevideo's most important plaza is Plaza Independencia, located between Ciudad Vieja and downtown Montevideo. It starts with the Gateway of The Citadel at one end and ends at the beginning of 18 de Julio Avenue. It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city. Several notable buildings are located here.  The Sol\u00eds Theatre is Uruguay's oldest theatre. It was built in 1856 and is currently owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theatre, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by Philippe Starck. The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theatre reopened in August of that year. The plaza is also the site of the offices of the President of Uruguay (both the Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower). The Artigas Mausoleum is located at the centre of the plaza. Statues include that of Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, hero of Uruguay's independence movement; an honour guard keeps vigil at the Mausoleum.Palacio Salvo, at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands 100 metres (330 ft) high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confiter\u00eda La Giralda, renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez wrote his tango \"La Cumparsita\" (1917.) Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.Also of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (or Plaza Matriz). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the Cabildo\u2014the seat of colonial government\u2014and the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral. The cathedral is the burial place of Fructuoso Rivera, Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Venancio Flores. Another notable square is Plaza Zabala with the equestrian statue of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On its south side, Palacio Taranco, once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto, another major tourist destination.\n\n\n==== Parque Batlle ====\n\nParque Batlle (formerly: Parque de los Aliados, translation: \"Park of the Allies\") is a major public central park, located south of Avenida Italia and north of Avenue Rivera. Along with Parque Prado and Parque Rod\u00f3 it is one of three large parks that dominate Montevideo. The park and surrounding area constitute one of the 62 neighbourhoods (barrios) of the city. The barrio of Parque Batlle is one of seven coastal barrios, the others being Buceo, Carrasco, Malvin, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, and Punta Gorda. The current barrio of Parque Battle includes four former districts: Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and Batlle Park itself and borders the neighbourhoods of La Blanqueada, Tres Cruces, Pocitos and Buceo. It has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income. Villa Dolores, a subdistrict of Parque Batlle, took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Do\u00f1a Dolores Pereira de Rossel. On their grounds, they started a private collection of animals that became a zoological garden and was passed to the city in 1919; in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises.\n\nParque Batlle is named in honour of Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915. The park was originally proposed by an Act of March 1907, which also projected wide boulevards and avenues. French landscape architect, Carlos Thays, began the plantings in 1911. In 1918, the park was named Parque de los Aliados, following the victory of the Allies of World War I. On 5 May 1930, after significant expansion, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, in memory of the prominent politician and president, who had died in 1929. The park was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975. As of 2010, the park covers an area of 60 hectares (150 acres) and is considered the \"lung\" of the Montevideo city due to the large variety of trees planted here.The Estadio Centenario, the national football stadium, opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, and later hosted several other sporting grounds of note (see Sports).\nIn 1934, sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni's \"La Carreta\", a bronze monument on granite base, was installed on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario. One of several statues in the park, it depicts yoked oxen pulling a loaded wagon. It was designated a national monument in 1976. Another statue on the same side of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron.\nOn the west side of Parque Batlle, on Artigas Boulevard, the 1938 Obelisk of Montevideo is a monument dedicated to those who created the first Constitution. The work of sculptor Jos\u00e9 Luis Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn (1891\u20131975), it is a three-sided granite obelisk, 40 metres (130 ft) tall, with bronze statues on its three sides, representing \"Law\", \"Liberty\", and \"Force\", respectively. It has been a National Heritage Site since 1976.\n\n\n==== Parque Prado ====\n\nEstablished in 1873, the largest of Montevideo's six main public parks is the 1.06-square-kilometre (260-acre) Parque Prado. Located in the northern part of the city, the Miguelete Creek flows through the park and the neighbourhood and of the same name. It is surrounded by the avenues Agraciada, Obes Lucas, Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez, Luis Alberto de Herrera and by the streets Castro and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyes.\nThe most frequented areas of the park are the Rosedal, a public rose garden with pergolas, the Botanical Garden, the area around the Hotel del Prado, as well as the Rural del Prado, a seasonal cattle and farm animal fairground. The Rosedal contains four pergolas, eight domes, and a fountain; its 12,000 roses were imported from France in 1910. There are several jogging paths along the Miguelete river.\nThe Presidential Residence is located behind the Botanical Gardens. Established in 1930, Juan Manuel Blanes Museum is situated in the Palladian villa, a National Heritage Site since 1975, and includes a Japanese garden. The Professor Atilio Lombardo Museum and Botanical Gardens were established in 1902. The National Institute of Physical Climatology and its observatory are also in the Prado.\n\n\n==== Parque Rod\u00f3 ====\n\nParque Rod\u00f3 is both a barrio (neighbourhood) of Montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighbourhood itself and belongs to Punta Carretas. The name \"Rod\u00f3\" commemorates Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, an important Uruguayan writer whose monument is in the southern side of the main park. The park was conceived as a French-style city park. Apart from the main park area which is delimited by Sarmiento Avenue to the south, Parque Rod\u00f3 includes an amusement park; the Estadio Luis Franzini, belonging to Defensor Sporting; the front lawn of the Faculty of Engineering and a strip west of the Club de Golf de Punta Carretas that includes the Canteras (\"quarry\") del Parque Rod\u00f3, the Teatro de Verano (\"summer theatre\") and the Lago (\"lake\") del Parque Rod\u00f3.On the east side of the main park area is the National Museum of Visual Arts. On this side, a street market takes place every Sunday. On the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children. An area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography. West of the park, across the coastal avenue Rambla Presidente Wilson, stretches Ramirez Beach. Directly west of the main park are, and belonging to Parque Rod\u00f3 barrio, is the former Parque Hotel, now called Edif\u00edcio Mercosur, seat of the parliament of the members countries of the Mercosur. During the guerilla war the Tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area, including the old hotel.\n\n\n==== Forts ====\nThe first set of subsidiary forts were planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at Colonia del Sacramento. However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship Nossa Senhora de Oliveara. They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.\n\n\n===== Fortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro) =====\n\nFortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839. It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931 and has housed a military museum since 1916. Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.\n\n\n==== Punta Brava Lighthouse ====\n\nPunta Brava Lighthouse (Faro Punta Brava), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876. The lighthouse is 21 metres (69 ft) high and its light reaches 24 km (15 mi) away, with a flash every ten seconds. In 1962, the lighthouse became electric. The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Ingl\u00e9s Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Luc\u00eda River.\n\n\n==== Rambla of Montevideo ====\n\nThe Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word rambla is \"avenue\" or \"watercourse\", but in the Americas it is mostly used as \"coastal avenue\", and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the R\u00edo de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas (\"United Nations\"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.\n\nThe Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even\u2014in a special area\u2014skateboard. Its 27-kilometre (17 mi) length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.Montevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city. Its best known beaches are Ram\u00edrez, Pocitos, Carrasco, Buceo and Malv\u00edn. Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.\n\n\n==== Cemeteries ====\n\nThere are five large cemeteries in Montevideo, all administered by the \"F\u00fanebre y Necr\u00f3polis\" annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Juan Manuel Blanes, Fran\u00e7ois Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont (Isidore Ducasse), Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, and Juan Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn.\nThe other large cemeteries are the Cementerio del Buceo, Cementerio del Cerro, and Cementerio Paso Molino.\nThe British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Brit\u00e1nico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighborhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Mr. Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors, contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine, Henry de Costa, is buried here.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nIn 1860, Montevideo had 57,913 inhabitants including a number of people of African origin who had been brought as slaves and had gained their freedom around the middle of the century. By 1880, the population had quadrupled, mainly because of the great European immigration. In 1908, its population had grown massively to 309,331 inhabitants. In the course of the 20th century the city continued to receive large numbers of European immigrants, especially Spanish and Italian, followed by French, Germans, English, Irish, Swiss, Austrians, Poles, Dutch, Greek, Hungarians, Russians, Croats, Lebanese, Armenians, and Jews of various origins. The last wave of immigrants occurred between 1945 and 1955.According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay's total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of \u22121.5 per thousand. Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975\u20131985, which showed a rate of \u22125.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004. However, mortality continued to fall with life expectancy at birth for both sexes increasing by 1.73 years.In the census of 2011, Montevideo had a population of 1,319,108.\nSource: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica de Uruguay\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Intendencia de Montevideo ===\n\nThe Municipality of Montevideo was first created by a legal act of 18 December 1908. The municipality's first mayor (1909\u20131911) was Daniel Mu\u00f1oz. Municipalities were abolished by the Uruguayan Constitution of 1918, effectively restored during the 1933 military coup of Gabriel Terra, and formally restored by the 1934 Constitution. The 1952 Constitution again decided to abolish the municipalities; it came into effect in February 1955. Municipalities were replaced by departmental councils, which consisted of a collegiate executive board with 7 members from Montevideo and 5 from the interior region. However, municipalities were revived under the 1967 Constitution and have operated continuously since that time.\nSince 1990, Montevideo has been partially decentralized into 18 areas; administration and services for each area is provided by its Zonal Community Center (Centro Comunal Zonal, CCZ), which is subordinate to the Municipality of Montevideo. The boundaries of the municipal districts of Montevideo were created on 12 July 1993, and successively amended on 19 October 1993, 6 June 1994 and 10 November 1994.\nThe city government of Montevideo performs several functions, including maintaining communications with the public, promoting culture, organizing society, caring for the environment and regulating traffic. Its headquarters is the Palacio Municipal on 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro area of Montevideo.Another body, the Junta Departamental, or the Congress of Montevideo, governs the Department of Montevideo. The Junta, composed of 31 unsalaried elected members, is responsible for such things as the freedom of the citizens, the regulation of cultural activities, the naming of streets and public places, and the placement of monuments; it also responds to proposals of the Intendant in various circumstances. Its seat is the architecturally remarkable Casa de Francisco G\u00f3mez in Ciudad Vieja.A 2016 private ranking named Subnational Legislative Online Opening Index measured the data availability in official websites, scoring Montevideo as the second most open district nationally at 17.50 points.\n\n\n=== Intendants of Montevideo ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn recent years Montevideo nightlife has moved to Parque Rod\u00f3, where a large concentration of buildings cater for the recreational interests of young people during the night time. Under a presidential decree of 1 March 2006 smoking is prohibited in any public place with roofing, and there is a prohibition on the sale of alcohol in certain businesses from 21.00 to 9.00.Montevideo has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Literature since December 2015.\n\n\n=== The arts ===\nMontevideo has a very rich architectural heritage and an impressive number of writers, artists, and musicians. Uruguayan tango is a unique form of dance that originated in the neighbourhoods of Montevideo towards the end of the 1800s. Tango, candombe and murga are the three main styles of music in this city. The city is also the centre of the cinema of Uruguay, which includes commercial, documentary and experimental films. There are two movie theatre companies running seven cinemas, around ten independent ones and four art film cinemas in the city. The theatre of Uruguay is admired inside and outside Uruguayan borders. The Sol\u00eds Theatre is the most prominent theatre in Uruguay and the oldest in South America. There are several notable theatrical companies and thousands of professional actors and amateurs. Montevideo playwrights produce dozens of works each year; of major note are Mauricio Rosencof, Ana Magnabosco and Ricardo Prieto. \n\n\n==== Visual arts ====\n\nThe daily newspaper El Pa\u00eds sponsors the Virtual Museum of contemporary Uruguayan art. The director and curator of the Museum presents exhibitions in \"virtual spaces, supplemented by information, biographies, texts in English and Spanish\".In the early 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo, one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a \"hotbed of resistance\". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nThe first public library in Montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of Father Jos\u00e9 Manuel P\u00e9rez Castellano, who died in 1815. Its promoter, director and organizer was Father D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga, who also made a considerable donation along with donations from Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Guerra, as well as others from the Convent of San Francisco in Salta. In 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes. The current building of the National Library of Uruguay (Biblioteca P\u00fablica de Uruguay) was designed by Luis Crespi in the Neoclassical style and occupies an area of 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). Construction began in 1926 and it was finally inaugurated in 1964. Its current collection amounts to roughly 900,000 volumes.\n\n\n===== Authors =====\n\nThe city has a long and rich literary tradition. Although Uruguayan literature is not limited to the authors of the capital (Horacio Quiroga was born in Salto and Mario Benedetti in Paso de los Toros, for instance), Montevideo has been and is the centre of the editorial and creative activity of literature.\nIn 1900, the city had a remarkable group of writers, including Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Julio Herrera y Reissig, Delmira Agustini and Felisberto Hern\u00e1ndez. Montevideo was then called the \"Atenas del Plata\" or the \"Athens of the Rio de la Plata\".\n\nAmong the outstanding authors of Montevideo of the second half of the 20th century are Juan Carlos Onetti, Antonio Larreta, Eduardo Galeano, Marosa di Giorgio and Cristina Peri Rossi.A new generation of writers have become known internationally in recent years. These include Eduardo Espina (essayist and poet), Fernando Butazzoni (novelist), Rafael Courtoisie (poet) and Hugo Burel (short story writer and novelist).\n\n\n==== Music ====\nIn Montevideo, as throughout the Rio de Plata region, the most popular forms of music are tango, milonga and vals criollo. Many notable songs originated in Montevideo including \"El Tango supremo\", La Cumparsita\", La Milonga\", \"La Pu\u00f1alada\" and \"Desde el Alma\", composed by notable Montevideo musicians such as Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez, Pint\u00edn Castellanos and Rosita Melo. Tango is deeply ingrained in the cultural life of the city and is the theme for many of the bars and restaurants in the city. Fun Fun' Bar, established in 1935, is one of the most important places for tango in Uruguay as is El Farolito, located in the old part of the city and Joventango, Caf\u00e9 Las Musas, Garufa and Vieja Viola. The city is also home to the Montevideo Jazz Festival and has the Bancaria Jazz Club bar catering for jazz enthusiasts.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe center of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto (\"Port Market\"). Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. A torta frita is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the centre for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt. Montevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Recreation ===\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nA Cultural Centre of Spain, as well as Asturian and cultural centres, testify to Montevideo's considerable Spanish heritage. Montevideo also has important museums including Museo Torres Garc\u00eda, Museo Jos\u00e9 Gurvich, Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales and Museo Juan Manuel Blanes etc.\nThe Montevideo Cabildo was the seat of government during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata. It is located in front of Constitution Square, in Ciudad Vieja. Built between 1804 and 1869 in Neoclassical style, with a series of Doric and Ionic columns, it became a National Heritage Site in 1975. In 1958, the Municipal Historic Museum and Archive was inaugurated here. It features three permanent city museum exhibitions, as well as temporary art exhibitions, cultural events, seminars, symposiums and forums.\n\nThe Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo's first theatre (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules-L\u00e9on Chifflot who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site. The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts, ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th\u201318th century from the area of present-day Iran. The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government.\n\nThe National History Museum of Montevideo is located in the historical residence of General Fructuoso Rivera. It exhibits artifacts related to the history of Uruguay. In a process begun in 1998, the National Museum of Natural History (1837) and the National Museum of Anthropology (1981), merged in 2001, becoming the National Museum of Natural History and Anthropology. In July 2009, the two institutions again became independent. The Historical Museum has annexed eight historical houses in the city, five of which are located in the Ciudad Vieja. One of them, on the same block with the main building, is the historic residence of Antonio Montero, which houses the Museo Romantico.\n\nThe Museo Torres Garc\u00eda is located in the Old Town, and exhibits Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda's unusual portraits of historical icons and cubist paintings akin to those of Picasso and Braque. The museum was established by Manolita Pi\u00f1a Torres, the widow of Torres Garcia, after his death in 1949. She also set up the Garc\u00eda Torres Foundation, a private non-profit organization that organizes the paintings, drawings, original writings, archives, objects and furniture designed by the painter as well as the photographs, magazines and publications related to him.\n\nThere are several other important art museums in Montevideo. The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rod\u00f3 has Uruguay's largest collection of paintings. The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930, the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay, significant with regard to the fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes. In back of the museum is a Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp. The Museo de Historia del Arte, located in the Palacio Municipal, features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period. The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial, in the Ciudad Vieja, has preserved collections of the archaeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archaeologist Antonio Taddei. These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America, painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Museo de Arte Contempo has small but impressive exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture.There are also other types of museums in the city. The Museo del Gaucho y de la Moneda, located in the Centro, has distinctive displays of the historical culture of Uruguay's gauchos, their horse gear, silver work and mate (tea), gourds, and bombillas (drinking straws) in odd designs. The Museo Naval, is located on the eastern waterfront in Buceo and offers exhibits depicting the maritime history of Uruguay. The Museo del Autom\u00f3vil, belonging to the Automobile Club of Uruguay, has a rich collection of vintage cars which includes a 1910 Hupmobile. The Museo y Parque Fernando Garc\u00eda in Carrasco, a transport and automobile museum, includes old horse carriages and some early automobiles. The Castillo Pittamiglio, with an unusual fa\u00e7ade, highlights the eccentric legacy of Humberto Pittamiglio, local alchemist and architect.\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\n\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is home to a number of festivals and carnivals including a Gaucho festival when people ride through the streets on horseback in traditional gaucho gear. The major annual festival is the annual Montevideo Carnival which is part of the national festival of Carnival Week, celebrated throughout Uruguay, with central activities in the capital, Montevideo. Officially, the public holiday lasts for two days on Carnival Monday and Shrove Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, but due to the prominence of the festival, most shops and businesses close for the entire week.\nDuring carnival there are many open-air stage performances and competitions and the streets and houses are vibrantly decorated. \"Tablados\" or popular scenes, both fixed and movable, are erected in the whole city. Notable displays include \"Desfile de las Llamadas\" (\"Parade of the Calls\"), which is a grand united parade held on the south part of downtown, where it used to be a common ritual back in the early 20th century. Due to the scale of the festival, preparation begins as early as December with an election of the \"zonal beauty queens\" to appear in the carnival.\n\n\n==== Sports ====\n\nEstadio Centenario, the national football stadium in Parque Batlle, was opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay's first constitution. In this World Cup, Uruguay won the title game against Argentina by 4 goals to 2. The stadium has 70,000 seats. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums, along with Maracan\u00e3, Wembley Stadium, San Siro, Estadio Azteca, and Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. A museum located within the football stadium has exhibits of memorabilia from Uruguay's 1930 and 1950 World Cup championships. Museum tickets give access to the stadium, stands, locker rooms and playing field.Between 1935 and 1938, the athletics track and the municipal velodrome were completed within Parque Batlle. The Tabar\u00e9 Athletic Club is occasionally made over as a carnival theatre using impermanent materials.\n\nToday the vast majority of teams in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n come from Montevideo, including Nacional, Pe\u00f1arol, Central Espa\u00f1ol, Cerrito, Cerro, Danubio, Defensor Sporting, Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9nix, Liverpool, Wanderers, Racing, River Plate, Club Atl\u00e9tico Torque and Rampla Juniors.\nBesides Estadio Centenario, other stadiums include Estadio Campeon del Siglo, Pe\u00f1arol, Gran Parque Central, Belvedere, Complejo Rentistas, Jardines del Hip\u00f3dromo, Jos\u00e9 Pedro Damiani, \"La Bombonera\", Luis Franzini, Luis Tr\u00f3ccoli and the park stadiums of Abraham Paladino, Alfredo V\u00edctor Viera, Omar Saroldi, Jos\u00e9 Nasazzi, Osvaldo Roberto, Maracan\u00e1 and Palermo.\nThe city has a tradition as host of major international basketball tournaments including the official 1967 FIBA World Cup and the 1988 1997 and 2017 editions of the official Americas Basketball Championship.\nThe Uruguayan Basketball League is headquartered in Montevideo and most of its teams are from the city, including Defensor Sporting, Bigu\u00e1, Aguada, Goes, Malv\u00edn, Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tica, and Trouville. Montevideo is also a centre of rugby; equestrianism, which regained importance in Montevideo after the Maro\u00f1as Racecourse reopened; golf, with the Club de Punta Carretas; and yachting, with the Puerto del Buceo, an ideal place to moor yachts. The Golf Club of Punta Carretas was founded in 1894 covers all the area encircled by the west side of Bulevar Artigas, the Rambla (Montevideo's promenade) and the Parque Rod\u00f3 (Fun Fair).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChurch and state are officially separated since 1916 in Uruguay. The religion with most followers in Montevideo is Roman Catholicism and has been so since the foundation of the city. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montevideo was created as the Apostolic Vicariate of Montevideo in 1830. The vicariate was promoted to the Diocese of Montevideo on 13 July 1878. Pope Leo XIII elevated it to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese on 14 April 1897. The new archdiocese became the Metropolitan of the suffragan sees of Canelones, Florida, Maldonado\u2013Punta del Este, Melo, Mercedes, Minas, Salto, San Jos\u00e9 de Mayo, Tacuaremb\u00f3.\nMontevideo is the only archdiocese in Uruguay and, as its Ordinary, the archbishop is also Primate of the Catholic Church in Uruguay. The archdiocese's mother church and thus seat of its archbishop is Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n y San Felipe y Santiago. As of 2010, the current Archbishop of Montevideo is Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet, SDB, since his appointment on 11 February 2014.Other religious faiths in Montevideo are Protestantism, Umbanda, Judaism, and there are many people who define themselves as Atheists and Agnostics, while others profess \"believing in God but without religion\".\n\n\n==== Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral ====\n\nThe Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Roman Catholic church of Montevideo. It is located in Ciudad Vieja, immediately across Constitution Square from the Cabildo. In 1740 a brick church was built on the site. In 1790, the foundation was laid for the current neoclassical structure. The church was consecrated in 1804. Bicentennial celebrations were held in 2004.\nIn 1897, Pope Leo XIII elevated the church to Metropolitan Cathedral status. Important ceremonies are conducted under the direction of the Archbishop of Montevideo. Weddings and choral concerts are held here and the parish priest conducts the routine functions of the cathedral. In the 19th century, its precincts were also used as a burial place of famous people who died in the city. For decades, the prison and the nearby Punta Carretas parish church were the only major buildings in the neighbourhood.\n\n\n==== Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n ====\n\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (\"Our Lady of the Sacred Heart\"), also known as Iglesia Punta Carretas (\"Punta Carretas Church\"), was built between 1917 and 1927 in the Romanesque Revival style. The church was originally part of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, but is presently in the parish of the Ecclesiastic Curia. Its location is at the corner of Solano Garc\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 Ellauri. It has a nave and aisles. The roof has many vaults. During the construction of the Punta Carretas Shopping complex, major cracks developed in the structure of the church as a result of differential foundation settlement.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is the economic and political centre of the country. Most of the largest and wealthiest businesses in Uruguay have their headquarters in the city. Since the 1990s the city has undergone rapid economic development and modernization, including two of Uruguay's most important buildings\u2014the World Trade Center Montevideo (1998), and Telecommunications Tower (2000), the headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company ANTEL, increasing the city's integration into the global marketplace.The Port of Montevideo, in the northern part of Ciudad Vieja, is one of the major ports of South America and plays a very important role in the city's economy. The port has been growing rapidly and consistently at an average annual rate of 14 percent due to an increase in foreign trade. The city has received a US$20 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to modernize the port, increase its size and efficiency, and enable lower maritime and river transportation costs.The most important state-owned companies headquartered in Montevideo are: AFE (railways), ANCAP (Energy), Administracion Nacional de Puertos (Ports), ANTEL (telecommunications), BHU (savings and loan), BROU (bank), BSE (insurance), OSE (water & sewage), UTE (electricity). These companies operate under public law, using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called Ente Autonomo (\"autonomous entity\"). The government also owns part of other companies operating under private law, such as those owned wholly or partially by the CND (National Development Corporation).\nBanking has traditionally been one of the strongest service export sectors in Uruguay: the country was once dubbed \"the Switzerland of America\", mainly for its banking sector and stability, although that stability has been threatened in the 21st century by the recent global economic climate. The largest bank in Uruguay is Banco Republica (BROU), based in Montevideo. Almost 20 private banks, most of them branches of international banks, operate in the country (Banco Santander, BBVA, ABN AMRO, Citibank, among others). There are also a myriad of brokers and financial-services bureaus, among them Ficus Capital, Galfin Sociedad de Bolsa, Europa Sociedad de Bolsa, Dar\u00edo Cukier, GBU, Horde\u00f1ana & Asociados Sociedad de Bolsa, etc.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism accounts for much of Uruguay's economy. Tourism in Montevideo is centered in the Ciudad Vieja area, which includes the city's oldest buildings, several museums, art galleries, and nightclubs, with Sarand\u00ed Street and the Mercado del Puerto being the most frequented venues of the old city. On the edge of Ciudad Vieja, Plaza Independencia is surrounded by many sights, including the Sol\u00eds Theatre and the Palacio Salvo; the plaza also constitutes one end of 18 de Julio Avenue, the city's most important tourist destination outside of Ciudad Vieja. Apart from being a shopping street, the avenue is noted for its Art Deco buildings, three important public squares, the Gaucho Museum, the Palacio Municipal and many other sights. The avenue leads to the Obelisk of Montevideo; beyond that is Parque Batlle, which along with the Parque Prado is another important tourist destination. Along the coast, the Fortaleza del Cerro, the Rambla (the coastal avenue), 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) of sandy beaches, and Punta Gorda attract many tourists, as do the Barrio Sur and Palermo barrios.The Ministry of Tourism offers a two-and-a-half-hour city tour and the Montevideo Tourist Guide Association offers guided tours in English, Italian, Portuguese and German. Apart from these, many private companies offer organized city tours.\nMost tourists to the city come from Argentina, Brazil and Europe, with the number of visitors from elsewhere in Latin America and from the United States growing every year, thanks to an increasing number of international airline arrivals at Carrasco International Airport as well as cruises that arrive into the port of Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\nMontevideo has over 50 hotels, mostly located in the city centre or along the beachfront of the Rambla de Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nMontevideo is the heartland of retailing in Uruguay. The city has become the principal centre of business and real estate, including many expensive buildings and modern towers for residences and offices, surrounded by extensive green spaces. In 1985, the first shopping centre in Rio de la Plata, Montevideo Shopping was built. In 1994, with building of three more shopping complexes such as the Shopping Tres Cruces, Portones Shopping, and Punta Carretas Shopping, the business map of the city changed dramatically. The creation of shopping complexes brought a major change in the habits of the people of Montevideo. Global firms such as McDonald's and Burger King etc. are firmly established in Montevideo.\nApart from the big shopping complexes, the main retailing venues of the city are: most of 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro and Cord\u00f3n barrios, a length of Agraciada Avenue in the Paso de Molino area of Belvedere, a length of Arenal Grande St. and the\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nOut of the 100 radio stations found in Uruguay, 40 of them are in Montevideo. The city has a vibrant artistic and literary community. The press enjoyed full freedom until the advent of the Civic-military dictatorship (1973\u20131985); this freedom returned on 1 March 1985, as part of the restoration of democracy.\nSome of the important newspapers published in the city are: Brecha, La Republica, El Observador, El Pa\u00eds, Gaceta Comercial and La Diaria. El D\u00eda was the most prestigious paper in Uruguay, founded in 1886 by Jos\u00e9 Batlle, who would later go on to become President of Uruguay. The paper ceased production in the early 1990s. All television stations have their headquarters in Montevideo, for example: Saeta Channel 10, Teledoce, Channel 4 and National Television (Channel 5)\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte (DNT), part of the national Ministry of Transport and Public Works, is responsible for the organization and development of Montevideo's transport infrastructure. A bus service network covers the entire city. An international bus station, the Tres Cruces Bus Station, is located on the lower level of the Tres Cruces Shopping Center, on the side of Artigas Boulevard. This terminal, along with the Baltazar Brum Bus Terminal (or Rio Branco Terminal) by the Port of Montevideo, handles the long distance and intercity bus routes connecting to destinations within Uruguay.\n\nThe State Railways Administration of Uruguay (AFE) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the Empalme Olmos, San Jose and Florida. These lines operate to major suburban areas of Canelones, San Jos\u00e9 and Florida. Within the Montevideo city limits, local trains stop at Lorenzo Carnelli, Yatai (Step Mill), Sayago, Columbus (line to San Jose and Florida), Pe\u00f1arol and Manga (line Empalme Olmos) stations. The historic 19th century General Artigas Central Station located in the neighbourhood of Aguada, six blocks from the central business district, was abandoned 1 March 2003 and remains closed. A new station, 500 metres (1,600 ft) north of the old one and part of the Tower of Communications modern complex, has taken over the rail traffic.Carrasco International Airport (IATA: MVD, ICAO: SUMU), which serves Montevideo, is located 19 km (12 mi) from the city centre. Several international airlines operate there. The airport serves over 1,500,000 passengers annually. \u00c1ngel S. Adami Airport is a private airport operated by minor charter companies.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Montevideo, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 65 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 18% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.2 km, while 6% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nThe port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbour entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of R\u00edo de la Plata, Buenos Aires.\nThe main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, until the 21st century, physical changes had ceased, and since that time the area had degraded due to national economic stagnation.The port's proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.Every year more than one hundred cruises arrive, bringing tourists to Montevideo by public or private tours.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Public education ===\nThe University of the Republic is the country's largest and most important university, with a student body of 81,774, according to the census of 2007. It was founded on 18 July 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its current Rector is Dr. Rodrigo Arocena. The university houses 14 faculties (departments) and various institutes and schools. Many eminent Uruguayans have graduated from this university, including Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Jos\u00e9 Luis Massera, Gabriel Paternain, Mario Wschebor, Roman Fresnedo Siri, Carlos Ott and Eladio Dieste\nThe process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time.\n\n\n=== Private education ===\nThe largest private university in Uruguay, is also located in Montevideo. ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942, and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996, becoming the second private educational institution in the country to achieve that status. It is a member of World ORT, an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nThe university has about 8,000 students, distributed among 5 faculties and institutes, mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering. Its current rector as of 2010 is Dr. Jorge A. Gr\u00fcnberg.\nThe Montevideo Crandon Institute is an American School of missionary origin and the main Methodist educational institution in Uruguay. Founded in 1879 and supported by the Women's Society of the Methodist Church of the United States, it is one of the most traditional and emblematic institutions in the city inculcating John Wesley's values. Its alumni include presidents, senators, ambassadors and Nobel Prize winners, along with musicians, scientists, and others. The Montevideo Crandon Institute boasts of being the first academic institution in South America where a home economics course was taught.\n\nThe Christian Brothers of Ireland Stella Maris College is a private, co-educational, not-for-profit Catholic school located in the wealthy residential southeastern neighbourhood of Carrasco. Established in 1955, it is regarded as one of the best high schools in the country, blending a rigorous curriculum with strong extracurricular activities. The school's headmaster, history professor Juan Pedro Toni, is a member of the Stella Maris Board of Governors and the school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Its long list of distinguished former pupils includes economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school's alumni club.\nAlso in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo, one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, founded in 1908 with \"the object of giving children a complete education, both intellectual and moral, based upon the ideas and principles of the best schools in The British Isles\".\nThe School is governed by the Board of Governors, elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay, whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay. Prominent alumni include former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry Herr\u00e1n and Gabriel Gurm\u00e9ndez Armand-Ugon.\nLocated in Cordon, St.Brendan's school, previously named St.Catherine's is a non-profit civil association, which has a solid institutional culture with a clear vision of the future. It is knowned for being one of the best schools in the country, joining students from the wealthiest parts of Montevideo, such us, Punta Carretas, Pocitos, Malvin and Carrasco.\nSt. Brendan's School is a bilingual, non-denominational school that promotes a pedagogical constructivist approach focused on the child as a whole. In this approach, understanding is built from the connections children make between their own prior knowledge and the learning experiences, thus developing critical thinking skills. It is also the only school in the country implementing the three International Baccalaureate Programmes. These are:\n\nDiploma Programme \u2013 Pre-University course for students aged 16 to 19. The Diploma Programme is a two-year curriculum.\nMYP -Middle Years Programme. For students aged 12 to 16.\nPYP \u2013 Primary Years Programme. For students aged 3 to 12.Other educational institutions of note include Colegio Ingles, Instituto Preuniversitario Salesiano Juan XXIII, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Montevideo, Ivy Thomas, German School of Montevideo and Colegio Preuniversitario Ciudad de San Felipe.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nIn Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by polyclinics and hospitals or sanatorios. The term hospital is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while sanatorio is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.\n\n\n=== Public hospitals ===\nHospital de Cl\u00ednicas \"Dr. Manuel Quintela\" is a University Hospital attached to the University of the Republic, and is located on Avenida Italia. It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928\u20131929 and has a surface area of 110,000 square metres (1,200,000 sq ft) on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr. Hugo Villar, who was a considerable influence on the institution.\nHospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaran\u00ed and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of Jos\u00e9 Toribio (son of Tom\u00e1s Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaran\u00ed street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaran\u00ed and 25 de Mayo) and Juli\u00e1n Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Est\u00e9vez in 1798.Hospital Pereira Rossell was founded in 1908 and was built on land donated in late 1900 by Alexis Rossell y Rius and Dolores Pereira de Rossell. It was the city's first pediatric hospital, and shortly afterwards the addition of an obstetric and gynaecological clinic in 1915 made it the first maternity hospital as well. Later, the hospital received a donation from Dr. Enrique Pouey for a radiotherapy unit.\nHospital Vilardeb\u00f3 is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist Teodoro Vilardeb\u00f3 Matuliche, it opened 21 May 1880. The hospital was originally one of the best of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel. It has an emergency service, outpatient, clinic and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others. The average patient age is 30 years; more than half of the patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.\nOther public polyclinics and hospitals of note include the Hospital Saint Bois, founded 18 November 1928, which consists of a General Hospital and Eye Hospital; the Pasteur Hospital in La Uni\u00f3n neighbourhood; the Hospital Espa\u00f1ol, which was founded in 1886, passed to the private sector in the 20th century, closed in 2004 and was restored and reinaugurated in 2007 as the municipal Juan Jose Crottogini Polyclinic; the National Cancer Institute; and the National Institute of Trauma and Orthopedics.\n\n\n=== Private healthcare ===\nPrivate healthcare is offered by many private health insurance companies, each of which has one or more polyclinics and owns or is associated with one or more hospitals. Private medical facilities of note include the Hospital Brit\u00e1nico, the Italian Hospital of Montevideo, Mutualista CASMU's Sanatoria I, II, III and IV, the Evangelical Hospital, M\u00e9dica Uruguaya, Sanatorio de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, Sanatorios del C\u00edrculo Cat\u00f3lico, Sanatorio Casa de Galicia and Sanatorio GREMCA.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nMontevideo is twinned with:\n\nMontevideo is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities since 12 October 1982.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nAlbes, Edward.

        "wiki": "Juan Manuel Blanes Municipal Museum of the Arts (Spanish: Museo de Bellas Artes Juan Manuel Blanes) is the name of a municipal museum in Prado, Montevideo, Uruguay.\n\n\n== Location and history ==\n\nThe Juan Manuel Blanes Municipal Museum of the Arts is located at Avenida Millan 4015, in the neighbourhood of Prado, Montevideo, in a Palladian villa designated a National Heritage Site in 1975. The villa was originally designed in 1870 by Juan Alberto Capurro, an engineer trained at the Turin Polytechnic, for the then-owner Dr. Juan Battista Raffo. The surrounding garden reveals elements of French landscape design. The municipality acquired the villa in 1929, when it commissioned the architect Eugenio Baroffio to renovate and expand the building. Baroffio maintained the eclecticism of the original design, leaving the facade intact. The museum was founded in 1930, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay, and named after the patriotic Uruguayan artist, Juan Manuel Blanes.\n\n\n== Park and gardens ==\nThis property has a big park full of ancient trees, on the shore of the Miguelete Creek.\nBehind the museum can be found the Japanese Garden.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe museum displays Uruguayan art ranging from the nation's founding to the present day, including the works of Juan Manuel Blanes, Pedro Figari, Rafael Barradas, Jos\u00e9 C\u00faneo, and Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\n\n== Hours and operation ==\nThe museum is open from noon to 5:45 p.m. every day from Tuesday through Sunday. It does not charge admission.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Uruguay\nParque Prado\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Montevideo (Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u03b2i\u02c8\u00f0eo]) is the capital and largest city of Uruguay. According to the 2011 census, the city proper has a population of 1,319,108 (about one-third of the country's total population) in an area of 201 square kilometres (78 sq mi). The southernmost capital city in the Americas, Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the R\u00edo de la Plata.\nThe city was established in 1724 by a Spanish soldier, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, as a strategic move amidst the Spanish-Portuguese dispute over the platine region. It was also under brief British rule in 1807. Montevideo is the seat of the administrative headquarters of Mercosur and ALADI, Latin America's leading trade blocs, a position that entailed comparisons to the role of Brussels in Europe.The 2019 Mercer's report on quality of life, rated Montevideo first in Latin America, a rank the city has consistently held since 2005. As of 2010, Montevideo was the 19th largest city economy in the continent and 9th highest income earner among major cities. In 2020, it has a projected GDP of $49.7 billion, with a per capita of $28,385.In 2018, it was classified as a beta global city ranking eighth in Latin America and 84th in the world. Montevideo hosted every match during the first FIFA World Cup, in 1930. Described as a \"vibrant, eclectic place with a rich cultural life\", and \"a thriving tech center and entrepreneurial culture\", Montevideo ranked eighth in Latin America on the 2013 MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.In 2014, it was also regarded as the fifth most gay-friendly metropolis in the world and the first in Latin America. It is the hub of commerce and higher education in Uruguay as well as its chief port. The city is also the financial hub of Uruguay and the cultural anchor of a metropolitan area with a population of around 2 million.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are several explanations about the word Montevideo. All agree that \"Monte\" refers to the Cerro de Montevideo, the hill situated across the Bay of Montevideo, but there is disagreement about the etymological origin of the \"video\" part.\n\nMonte vide eu (\"I saw a mount\") is the most widespread belief but is rejected by the majority of experts, who consider it unlikely because it involves a mix of dialects. The name would come from a Portuguese expression which means \"I saw a mount\", wrongly pronounced by an anonymous sailor belonging to the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes on catching sight of the Cerro de Montevideo.\nMonte Vidi: This hypothesis comes from the \"Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n\" (Navigational Calendar) of boatswain Francisco de Albo, member of the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes, who wrote, \"Tuesday of the said [month of January 1520] we were on the straits of Cape Santa Mar\u00eda [now Punta del Este], from where the coast runs east to west, and the terrain is sandy, and at the right of the cape there is a mountain like a hat to which we gave the name \"Montevidi\".\" This is the oldest Spanish document that mentions the promontory with a name similar to the one that designates the city, but it does not contain any mention of the alleged cry \"Monte vide eu.\"\nMonte-VI-D-E-O (Monte VI De Este a Oeste): According to Rolando Laguarda Tr\u00edas, professor of history, the Spaniards annotated the geographic location on a map or Portolan chart, so that the mount/hill is the VI (6th) mount observable on the coast, navigating R\u00edo de la Plata from east to west. With the passing of time, these words were unified to \"Montevideo\". No conclusive evidence has been found to confirm this academic hypothesis nor can it be asserted with certainty which were the other five mounts observable before the Cerro.\nMonte Ovidio (Monte Santo Ovidio), a less widespread hypothesis of a religious origin, stems from an interpolation in the aforementioned Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n of Fernando de Albo, where it is asserted \"corruptly now called Santo Vidio\" when they refer to the hat-like mount which they named Monte Vidi (that is, the Cerro de Montevideo). Ovidio (Saint Ovidius) was the third bishop of the Portuguese city of Braga, where he was always revered; a monument to him was erected there in 1505. Given the relationship that the Portuguese had with the discovery and foundation of Montevideo, and despite the fact that this hypothesis, like the previous ones, lacks conclusive documentation, there have been those who linked the name of Santo Ovidio or Vidio (appearing on some maps of the time) with the subsequent derivation of the name \"Montevideo\" given to the region since the early years of the 16th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBetween 1680 and 1683, Portugal founded the city of Colonia do Sacramento in the region across the bay from Buenos Aires. This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca of Portugal built the Montevieu fort.\nA Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were known as Guanches or Canarians. There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name of Jorge Burgues.A census of the city's inhabitants was performed in 1724 and then a plan was drawn delineating the city and designating it as San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo, later shortened to Montevideo. The census counted fifty families of Galician and Canary Islands origin, more than 1000 indigenous people, mostly Guaran\u00ed, as well as Black African slaves of Bantu origin.A few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the R\u00edo de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River, competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata brought it in confrontations with the city of Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was taken over to be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.\nIn 1776, Spain made Montevideo its main naval base (Real Apostadero de Marina) for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, Fernando Po, and the Falklands.Until the end of the 18th century, Montevideo remained a fortified area, today known as Ciudad Vieja.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nOn 3 February 1807, British troops under the command of General Samuel Auchmuty and Admiral Charles Stirling occupied the city during the Battle of Montevideo (1807), but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the same year on 2 September when John Whitelocke was forced to surrender to troops formed by forces of the Banda Oriental\u2014roughly the same area as modern Uruguay\u2014and of Buenos Aires. After this conflict, the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de El\u00edo opposed the new viceroy Santiago de Liniers, and created a government Junta when the Peninsular War started in Spain, in defiance of Liniers. El\u00edo disestablished the Junta when Liniers was replaced by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros.\nDuring the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo. During that year and the next, Uruguayan revolutionary Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain. In 1811, the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo, which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution. The siege was lifted at the end of that year, when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region.The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814. In 1816, Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821, it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil. It was named Imperial City by Emperor Pedro I when the city was part of the Empire of Brazil as capital of the Cisplatina province. Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the Treinta y Tres Orientales (\"Thirty-Three Orientals\") re-established the independence of the region in 1825. Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828, with Montevideo as the nation's capital. In 1829, the demolition of the city's fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja, referred to as the \"Ciudad Nueva\" (\"new city\"). Urban expansion, however, moved very slowly because of the events that followed.\n\nUruguay's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between Manuel Oribe and Fructuoso Rivera, the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the Empire of Brazil under the command of Lavalleja, each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction. Politics were divided between Oribe's Blancos (\"whites\"), represented by the National Party, and Rivera's Colorados (\"reds\"), represented by the Colorado Party, with each party's name taken from the colour of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the Guerra Grande, which lasted until 1851.\nThe city of Montevideo suffered a siege of eight years between 1843 and 1851, during which it was supplied by sea with British and French support. Oribe, with the support of the then conservative Governor of Buenos Aires Province Juan Manuel de Rosas, besieged the Colorados in Montevideo, where the latter were supported by the French Legion, the Italian Legion, the Basque Legion and battalions from Brazil. Finally, in 1851, with the additional support of Argentine rebels who opposed Rosas, the Colorados defeated Oribe. The fighting, however, resumed in 1855, when the Blancos came to power, which they maintained until 1865. Thereafter, the Colorado Party regained power, which they retained until past the middle of the 20th century.\nAfter the end of hostilities, a period of growth and expansion started for the city. In 1853 a stagecoach bus line was established joining Montevideo with the newly formed settlement of Uni\u00f3n and the first natural gas street lights were inaugurated. From 1854 to 1861 the first public sanitation facilities were constructed. In 1856 the Teatro Sol\u00eds was inaugurated, 15 years after the beginning of its construction. By Decree, in December 1861 the areas of Aguada and Cord\u00f3n were incorporated to the growing Ciudad Nueva (New City). In 1866, an underwater telegraph line connected the city with Buenos Aires. The statue of Peace, La Paz, was erected on a column in Plaza Cagancha and the building of the Postal Service as well as the bridge of Paso Molino were inaugurated in 1867.In 1868, the horse-drawn tram company Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tranv\u00edas al Paso del Molino y Cerro created the first lines connecting Montevideo with Uni\u00f3n, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro, at the time called Cosmopolis. In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras. During the same year and the next, the neighbourhoods Col\u00f3n, Nuevo Par\u00eds and La Comercial were founded. The Sunday market of Trist\u00e1n Narvaja Street was established in Cord\u00f3n in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, Bulevar Circunvalaci\u00f3n was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas, going up to the north end of the city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed to Artigas Boulevard (its current name) in 1885. By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area Los Pocitos was incorporated to the Nov\u00edsima Ciudad (Most New City).The first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas operated ones in 1886. The Hip\u00f3dromo de Maro\u00f1as started operating in 1888, and the neighbourhoods of Reus del Sur, Reus del Norte and Conciliaci\u00f3n were inaugurated in 1889. The new building of the School of Arts and Trades, as well as Zabala Square in Ciudad Vieja were inaugurated in 1890, followed by the Italian Hospital in 1891. In the same year, the village of Pe\u00f1arol was founded. Other neighbourhoods that were founded were Belgrano and Belvedere in 1892, Jacinto Vera in 1895 and Trouville in 1897. In 1894 the new port was constructed, and in 1897, the Central Railway Station of Montevideo was inaugurated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, many Europeans (particularly Spaniards and Italians but also thousands from Central Europe) immigrated to the city. In 1908, 30% of the city's population of 300,000 was foreign-born. In that decade the city expanded quickly: new neighbourhoods were created and many separate settlements were annexed to the city, among which were the Villa del Cerro, Pocitos, the Prado and Villa Col\u00f3n. The Rod\u00f3 Park and the Estadio Gran Parque Central were also established, which served as poles of urban development.During the early 20th century, Uruguay saw huge social changes with repercussions primarily in urban areas. Among these changes were the right of divorce (1907) and women's right to vote.The 1910s saw the construction of Montevideo's Rambla; strikes by tram workers, bakers and port workers; the inauguration of electric trams; the creation of the Municipal Intendencias; and the inauguration of the new port.In 1913, the city limits were extended around the entire gulf. The previously independent localities of the Villa del Cerro and La Teja were annexed to Montevideo, becoming two of its neighborhoods.During the 1920s, the equestrian statue of Artigas was installed in Plaza Independencia; the Palacio Legislativo was built; the Spanish Plus Ultra flying boat arrived (the first airplane to fly from Spain to Latin America, 1926); prominent politician and former president Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez died (1929); and ground was broken (1929) for the Estadio Centenario (completed 1930).During World War II, a famous incident involving the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee took place in Punta del Este, 200 kilometers (120 mi) from Montevideo. After the Battle of the River Plate with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy on 13 December 1939, the Graf Spee retreated to Montevideo's port, which was considered neutral at the time. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on 17 December. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. The eagle figurehead of the Graf Spee was salvaged on 10 February 2006; to protect the feelings of those still sensitive to Nazi Germany, the swastika on the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water.\n\nUruguay began to stagnate economically in the mid-1950s; Montevideo began a decline, later exacerbated by widespread social and political violence beginning in 1968 (including the emergence of the guerrilla Movimiento de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional-Tupamaros) and by the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985). There were major problems with supply; the immigration cycle was reversed.\nFrom the 1960s to the end of the dictatorship in 1985, around one hundred people died or disappeared because of the political violence. From 1974 another hundred Uruguayans disappeared also in Argentina. In 1980, the dictatorship proposed a new constitution. The project was submitted to referendum and rejected in the first polls since 1971, with 58% of the votes against and 42% in favour. The result weakened the military and triggered its fall, allowing the return of democracy.In the 1980s, Pope John Paul II visited the city twice. In April 1987, as head of state of Vatican, he signed a mediation agreement for the conflict of the Beagle Channel. He also held a large mass in Tres Cruces, declaring the cross located behind the altar as a monument. In 1988, he returned to the country, visiting Montevideo, Florida, Salto and Melo.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe 2002 Uruguay banking crisis affected several industries of Montevideo. In 2017, the city has maintained 15 years of economic growth, with a GDP of $44 billion, and a GDP per capita of $25,900.Montevideo has consistently been rated as having the highest quality of life of any city in Latin America: by 2015 it held this rank every year during the decade through 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMontevideo is situated on the north shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata, the arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the south coast of Uruguay from the north coast of Argentina; Buenos Aires lies 230 kilometres (140 mi) west on the Argentine side. The Santa Luc\u00eda River forms a natural border between Montevideo and San Jos\u00e9 Department to its west. To the city's north and east is Canelones Department, with the stream of Carrasco forming the eastern natural border. The coastline forming the city's southern border is interspersed with rocky protrusions and sandy beaches. The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbour, the nation's largest and one of the largest in the Southern Cone, and the finest natural port in the region, functioning as a crucial component of the Uruguayan economy and foreign trade. Various streams criss-cross the town and empty into the Bay of Montevideo. Its coastline near the emptying rivers are heavily polluted.The city has an average elevation of 43 metres (141 ft). Its highest elevations are two hills: the Cerro de Montevideo and the Cerro de la Victoria, with the highest point, the peak of Cerro de Montevideo, crowned by a fortress, the Fortaleza del Cerro at a height of 134 m (440 ft). Closest cities by road are Las Piedras to the north and the so-called Ciudad de la Costa (a conglomeration of coastal towns) to the east, both in the range of 20 to 25 km (16 mi) from the city center. The approximate distances to the neighbouring department capitals by road are, 90 km (56 mi) to San Jose de Mayo (San Jose Department) and 46 km (29 mi) to Canelones (Canelones Department).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontevideo enjoys a humid subtropical climate (Cfa, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). The city has mild winters (June to September), warm-hot summers (December to March) and volatile springs (October and November); there are numerous thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout the year, reaching around 950 millimetres (37 in).Winters are generally cool, wet, windy and overcast. During this season, there are bursts of icy and relatively dry winds of continental polar air masses, giving an unpleasant chilly feeling to the everyday life of the city. Frosts occur few times during winter, generally not falling below 28\u00b0 F (-2\u00b0 C) because of the oceanic influence that moderates the temperature; few miles away from the coast, frosts are more common and colder. Rainfall and sleet are a frequent winter occurrence, but snowfall is extremely rare: flurries have been recorded only four times but with no accumulation, the last one on 13 July 1930 during the inaugural match of the World Cup, (the other three snowfalls were in 1850, 1853 and 1917); the alleged 1980 Carrasco snowfall was actually a hailstorm.Summers are warm-hot and humid, with less wind than other seasons. During this season, a moderate wind often blows from the sea in the evenings which has a pleasant cooling effect on the city, in contrast to the more-severe summer heat of nearby cities like Buenos Aires. Heat waves come with the north winds, which bring humid and hot air masses from the tropical interior of the continent. These warm periods are usually followed by thunderstorms, generated by cold fronts of the southwest that lowers temperatures considerably. This phenomenon is regional, and can occur several times all year long.\nMontevideo has an annual average temperature of 16.7 \u00b0C (62.1 \u00b0F). The lowest recorded temperature is \u22125.6 \u00b0C (21.9 \u00b0F) while the highest is 42.8 \u00b0C (109.0 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions and barrios ===\n\nAs of 2010, the city of Montevideo has been divided into 8 political municipalities (Municipios), referred to with the letters from A to G, including CH, each presided over by a mayor elected by the citizens registered in the constituency. This division, according to the Municipality of Montevideo, \"aims to advance political and administrative decentralization in the department of Montevideo, with the aim of deepening the democratic participation of citizens in governance.\" The head of each Municipio is called an alcalde or (if female) alcaldesa.Of much greater importance is the division of the city into 62 barrios: neighbourhoods or wards. Many of the city's barrios\u2014such as Sayago, Ituzaing\u00f3 and Pocitos\u2014were previously geographically separate settlements, later absorbed by the growth of the city. Others grew up around certain industrial sites, including the salt-curing works of Villa del Cerro and the tanneries in Nuevo Par\u00eds. Each barrio has its own identity, geographic location and socio-cultural activities. A neighbourhood of great significance is Ciudad Vieja, that was surrounded by a protective wall until 1829. This area contains most important buildings of the colonial era and early decades of independence.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n\nThe architecture of Montevideo ranges from Neoclassical buildings such as the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral to the Postmodern style of the World Trade Center Montevideo or the 158-metre (518 ft) ANTEL Telecommunication Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the country. The Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the Palacio Salvo dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building facades in the Old Town reflect the city's extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the Legislative Palace, the City Hall, Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower. The most notable sports stadium is the Estadio Centenario within Parque Batlle. Parque Batlle, Parque Rod\u00f3 and Parque Prado are Montevideo's three great parks.The Pocitos district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the \"Edificio Panamericano\" designed by Raul Sichero, and the \"Positano\" and \"El Pilar\" designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis Garc\u00eda Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighbourhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle class residents.\n\n\n==== Palacio Legislativo ====\n\nThe Palacio Legislativo in Aguada, the north of the city centre, is currently the seat of the Uruguayan Parliament. Construction started in 1904 and was sponsored by the government of President Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. It was designed by Italian architects Vittorio Meano and Gaetano Moretti, who planned the building's interior. Among the notable contributors to the project was sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni, who contributed numerous reliefs and allegorical sculptures.\n\n\n==== World Trade Center Montevideo ====\n\nWorld Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998, but work was completed in 2009. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998. It has 22 floors and 17,100 square metres of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and 27,000 square metres (290,000 sq ft) of space. The 6,300-square-metre (68,000 sq ft) World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a centre of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St. Among the establishments on the plaza are Burger King, Walrus, Bamboo, Asia de Cuba, Gardenia Mvd, and La Claraboya Cafe.\nThe Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social place. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor Pablo Atchugarry. World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and 53,500 square metres (576,000 sq ft) of space is under construction as of 2010.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications Tower ====\n\nTorre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the 158 metres (518 ft), 37-floor headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company, ANTEL, and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect Carlos Ott. It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by American Bridge and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.\nWhen its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40 million, plus US$25 million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65 million price into US$102 million.\n\n\n==== Ciudad Vieja (Old City) ====\n\nCiudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent barrio of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and night-clubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.\n\nMontevideo's most important plaza is Plaza Independencia, located between Ciudad Vieja and downtown Montevideo. It starts with the Gateway of The Citadel at one end and ends at the beginning of 18 de Julio Avenue. It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city. Several notable buildings are located here.  The Sol\u00eds Theatre is Uruguay's oldest theatre. It was built in 1856 and is currently owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theatre, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by Philippe Starck. The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theatre reopened in August of that year. The plaza is also the site of the offices of the President of Uruguay (both the Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower). The Artigas Mausoleum is located at the centre of the plaza. Statues include that of Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, hero of Uruguay's independence movement; an honour guard keeps vigil at the Mausoleum.Palacio Salvo, at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands 100 metres (330 ft) high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confiter\u00eda La Giralda, renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez wrote his tango \"La Cumparsita\" (1917.) Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.Also of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (or Plaza Matriz). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the Cabildo\u2014the seat of colonial government\u2014and the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral. The cathedral is the burial place of Fructuoso Rivera, Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Venancio Flores. Another notable square is Plaza Zabala with the equestrian statue of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On its south side, Palacio Taranco, once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto, another major tourist destination.\n\n\n==== Parque Batlle ====\n\nParque Batlle (formerly: Parque de los Aliados, translation: \"Park of the Allies\") is a major public central park, located south of Avenida Italia and north of Avenue Rivera. Along with Parque Prado and Parque Rod\u00f3 it is one of three large parks that dominate Montevideo. The park and surrounding area constitute one of the 62 neighbourhoods (barrios) of the city. The barrio of Parque Batlle is one of seven coastal barrios, the others being Buceo, Carrasco, Malvin, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, and Punta Gorda. The current barrio of Parque Battle includes four former districts: Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and Batlle Park itself and borders the neighbourhoods of La Blanqueada, Tres Cruces, Pocitos and Buceo. It has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income. Villa Dolores, a subdistrict of Parque Batlle, took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Do\u00f1a Dolores Pereira de Rossel. On their grounds, they started a private collection of animals that became a zoological garden and was passed to the city in 1919; in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises.\n\nParque Batlle is named in honour of Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915. The park was originally proposed by an Act of March 1907, which also projected wide boulevards and avenues. French landscape architect, Carlos Thays, began the plantings in 1911. In 1918, the park was named Parque de los Aliados, following the victory of the Allies of World War I. On 5 May 1930, after significant expansion, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, in memory of the prominent politician and president, who had died in 1929. The park was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975. As of 2010, the park covers an area of 60 hectares (150 acres) and is considered the \"lung\" of the Montevideo city due to the large variety of trees planted here.The Estadio Centenario, the national football stadium, opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, and later hosted several other sporting grounds of note (see Sports).\nIn 1934, sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni's \"La Carreta\", a bronze monument on granite base, was installed on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario. One of several statues in the park, it depicts yoked oxen pulling a loaded wagon. It was designated a national monument in 1976. Another statue on the same side of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron.\nOn the west side of Parque Batlle, on Artigas Boulevard, the 1938 Obelisk of Montevideo is a monument dedicated to those who created the first Constitution. The work of sculptor Jos\u00e9 Luis Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn (1891\u20131975), it is a three-sided granite obelisk, 40 metres (130 ft) tall, with bronze statues on its three sides, representing \"Law\", \"Liberty\", and \"Force\", respectively. It has been a National Heritage Site since 1976.\n\n\n==== Parque Prado ====\n\nEstablished in 1873, the largest of Montevideo's six main public parks is the 1.06-square-kilometre (260-acre) Parque Prado. Located in the northern part of the city, the Miguelete Creek flows through the park and the neighbourhood and of the same name. It is surrounded by the avenues Agraciada, Obes Lucas, Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez, Luis Alberto de Herrera and by the streets Castro and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyes.\nThe most frequented areas of the park are the Rosedal, a public rose garden with pergolas, the Botanical Garden, the area around the Hotel del Prado, as well as the Rural del Prado, a seasonal cattle and farm animal fairground. The Rosedal contains four pergolas, eight domes, and a fountain; its 12,000 roses were imported from France in 1910. There are several jogging paths along the Miguelete river.\nThe Presidential Residence is located behind the Botanical Gardens. Established in 1930, Juan Manuel Blanes Museum is situated in the Palladian villa, a National Heritage Site since 1975, and includes a Japanese garden. The Professor Atilio Lombardo Museum and Botanical Gardens were established in 1902. The National Institute of Physical Climatology and its observatory are also in the Prado.\n\n\n==== Parque Rod\u00f3 ====\n\nParque Rod\u00f3 is both a barrio (neighbourhood) of Montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighbourhood itself and belongs to Punta Carretas. The name \"Rod\u00f3\" commemorates Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, an important Uruguayan writer whose monument is in the southern side of the main park. The park was conceived as a French-style city park. Apart from the main park area which is delimited by Sarmiento Avenue to the south, Parque Rod\u00f3 includes an amusement park; the Estadio Luis Franzini, belonging to Defensor Sporting; the front lawn of the Faculty of Engineering and a strip west of the Club de Golf de Punta Carretas that includes the Canteras (\"quarry\") del Parque Rod\u00f3, the Teatro de Verano (\"summer theatre\") and the Lago (\"lake\") del Parque Rod\u00f3.On the east side of the main park area is the National Museum of Visual Arts. On this side, a street market takes place every Sunday. On the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children. An area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography. West of the park, across the coastal avenue Rambla Presidente Wilson, stretches Ramirez Beach. Directly west of the main park are, and belonging to Parque Rod\u00f3 barrio, is the former Parque Hotel, now called Edif\u00edcio Mercosur, seat of the parliament of the members countries of the Mercosur. During the guerilla war the Tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area, including the old hotel.\n\n\n==== Forts ====\nThe first set of subsidiary forts were planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at Colonia del Sacramento. However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship Nossa Senhora de Oliveara. They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.\n\n\n===== Fortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro) =====\n\nFortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839. It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931 and has housed a military museum since 1916. Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.\n\n\n==== Punta Brava Lighthouse ====\n\nPunta Brava Lighthouse (Faro Punta Brava), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876. The lighthouse is 21 metres (69 ft) high and its light reaches 24 km (15 mi) away, with a flash every ten seconds. In 1962, the lighthouse became electric. The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Ingl\u00e9s Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Luc\u00eda River.\n\n\n==== Rambla of Montevideo ====\n\nThe Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word rambla is \"avenue\" or \"watercourse\", but in the Americas it is mostly used as \"coastal avenue\", and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the R\u00edo de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas (\"United Nations\"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.\n\nThe Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even\u2014in a special area\u2014skateboard. Its 27-kilometre (17 mi) length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.Montevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city. Its best known beaches are Ram\u00edrez, Pocitos, Carrasco, Buceo and Malv\u00edn. Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.\n\n\n==== Cemeteries ====\n\nThere are five large cemeteries in Montevideo, all administered by the \"F\u00fanebre y Necr\u00f3polis\" annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Juan Manuel Blanes, Fran\u00e7ois Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont (Isidore Ducasse), Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, and Juan Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn.\nThe other large cemeteries are the Cementerio del Buceo, Cementerio del Cerro, and Cementerio Paso Molino.\nThe British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Brit\u00e1nico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighborhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Mr. Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors, contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine, Henry de Costa, is buried here.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nIn 1860, Montevideo had 57,913 inhabitants including a number of people of African origin who had been brought as slaves and had gained their freedom around the middle of the century. By 1880, the population had quadrupled, mainly because of the great European immigration. In 1908, its population had grown massively to 309,331 inhabitants. In the course of the 20th century the city continued to receive large numbers of European immigrants, especially Spanish and Italian, followed by French, Germans, English, Irish, Swiss, Austrians, Poles, Dutch, Greek, Hungarians, Russians, Croats, Lebanese, Armenians, and Jews of various origins. The last wave of immigrants occurred between 1945 and 1955.According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay's total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of \u22121.5 per thousand. Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975\u20131985, which showed a rate of \u22125.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004. However, mortality continued to fall with life expectancy at birth for both sexes increasing by 1.73 years.In the census of 2011, Montevideo had a population of 1,319,108.\nSource: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica de Uruguay\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Intendencia de Montevideo ===\n\nThe Municipality of Montevideo was first created by a legal act of 18 December 1908. The municipality's first mayor (1909\u20131911) was Daniel Mu\u00f1oz. Municipalities were abolished by the Uruguayan Constitution of 1918, effectively restored during the 1933 military coup of Gabriel Terra, and formally restored by the 1934 Constitution. The 1952 Constitution again decided to abolish the municipalities; it came into effect in February 1955. Municipalities were replaced by departmental councils, which consisted of a collegiate executive board with 7 members from Montevideo and 5 from the interior region. However, municipalities were revived under the 1967 Constitution and have operated continuously since that time.\nSince 1990, Montevideo has been partially decentralized into 18 areas; administration and services for each area is provided by its Zonal Community Center (Centro Comunal Zonal, CCZ), which is subordinate to the Municipality of Montevideo. The boundaries of the municipal districts of Montevideo were created on 12 July 1993, and successively amended on 19 October 1993, 6 June 1994 and 10 November 1994.\nThe city government of Montevideo performs several functions, including maintaining communications with the public, promoting culture, organizing society, caring for the environment and regulating traffic. Its headquarters is the Palacio Municipal on 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro area of Montevideo.Another body, the Junta Departamental, or the Congress of Montevideo, governs the Department of Montevideo. The Junta, composed of 31 unsalaried elected members, is responsible for such things as the freedom of the citizens, the regulation of cultural activities, the naming of streets and public places, and the placement of monuments; it also responds to proposals of the Intendant in various circumstances. Its seat is the architecturally remarkable Casa de Francisco G\u00f3mez in Ciudad Vieja.A 2016 private ranking named Subnational Legislative Online Opening Index measured the data availability in official websites, scoring Montevideo as the second most open district nationally at 17.50 points.\n\n\n=== Intendants of Montevideo ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn recent years Montevideo nightlife has moved to Parque Rod\u00f3, where a large concentration of buildings cater for the recreational interests of young people during the night time. Under a presidential decree of 1 March 2006 smoking is prohibited in any public place with roofing, and there is a prohibition on the sale of alcohol in certain businesses from 21.00 to 9.00.Montevideo has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Literature since December 2015.\n\n\n=== The arts ===\nMontevideo has a very rich architectural heritage and an impressive number of writers, artists, and musicians. Uruguayan tango is a unique form of dance that originated in the neighbourhoods of Montevideo towards the end of the 1800s. Tango, candombe and murga are the three main styles of music in this city. The city is also the centre of the cinema of Uruguay, which includes commercial, documentary and experimental films. There are two movie theatre companies running seven cinemas, around ten independent ones and four art film cinemas in the city. The theatre of Uruguay is admired inside and outside Uruguayan borders. The Sol\u00eds Theatre is the most prominent theatre in Uruguay and the oldest in South America. There are several notable theatrical companies and thousands of professional actors and amateurs. Montevideo playwrights produce dozens of works each year; of major note are Mauricio Rosencof, Ana Magnabosco and Ricardo Prieto. \n\n\n==== Visual arts ====\n\nThe daily newspaper El Pa\u00eds sponsors the Virtual Museum of contemporary Uruguayan art. The director and curator of the Museum presents exhibitions in \"virtual spaces, supplemented by information, biographies, texts in English and Spanish\".In the early 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo, one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a \"hotbed of resistance\". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nThe first public library in Montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of Father Jos\u00e9 Manuel P\u00e9rez Castellano, who died in 1815. Its promoter, director and organizer was Father D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga, who also made a considerable donation along with donations from Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Guerra, as well as others from the Convent of San Francisco in Salta. In 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes. The current building of the National Library of Uruguay (Biblioteca P\u00fablica de Uruguay) was designed by Luis Crespi in the Neoclassical style and occupies an area of 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). Construction began in 1926 and it was finally inaugurated in 1964. Its current collection amounts to roughly 900,000 volumes.\n\n\n===== Authors =====\n\nThe city has a long and rich literary tradition. Although Uruguayan literature is not limited to the authors of the capital (Horacio Quiroga was born in Salto and Mario Benedetti in Paso de los Toros, for instance), Montevideo has been and is the centre of the editorial and creative activity of literature.\nIn 1900, the city had a remarkable group of writers, including Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Julio Herrera y Reissig, Delmira Agustini and Felisberto Hern\u00e1ndez. Montevideo was then called the \"Atenas del Plata\" or the \"Athens of the Rio de la Plata\".\n\nAmong the outstanding authors of Montevideo of the second half of the 20th century are Juan Carlos Onetti, Antonio Larreta, Eduardo Galeano, Marosa di Giorgio and Cristina Peri Rossi.A new generation of writers have become known internationally in recent years. These include Eduardo Espina (essayist and poet), Fernando Butazzoni (novelist), Rafael Courtoisie (poet) and Hugo Burel (short story writer and novelist).\n\n\n==== Music ====\nIn Montevideo, as throughout the Rio de Plata region, the most popular forms of music are tango, milonga and vals criollo. Many notable songs originated in Montevideo including \"El Tango supremo\", La Cumparsita\", La Milonga\", \"La Pu\u00f1alada\" and \"Desde el Alma\", composed by notable Montevideo musicians such as Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez, Pint\u00edn Castellanos and Rosita Melo. Tango is deeply ingrained in the cultural life of the city and is the theme for many of the bars and restaurants in the city. Fun Fun' Bar, established in 1935, is one of the most important places for tango in Uruguay as is El Farolito, located in the old part of the city and Joventango, Caf\u00e9 Las Musas, Garufa and Vieja Viola. The city is also home to the Montevideo Jazz Festival and has the Bancaria Jazz Club bar catering for jazz enthusiasts.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe center of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto (\"Port Market\"). Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. A torta frita is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the centre for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt. Montevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Recreation ===\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nA Cultural Centre of Spain, as well as Asturian and cultural centres, testify to Montevideo's considerable Spanish heritage. Montevideo also has important museums including Museo Torres Garc\u00eda, Museo Jos\u00e9 Gurvich, Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales and Museo Juan Manuel Blanes etc.\nThe Montevideo Cabildo was the seat of government during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata. It is located in front of Constitution Square, in Ciudad Vieja. Built between 1804 and 1869 in Neoclassical style, with a series of Doric and Ionic columns, it became a National Heritage Site in 1975. In 1958, the Municipal Historic Museum and Archive was inaugurated here. It features three permanent city museum exhibitions, as well as temporary art exhibitions, cultural events, seminars, symposiums and forums.\n\nThe Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo's first theatre (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules-L\u00e9on Chifflot who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site. The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts, ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th\u201318th century from the area of present-day Iran. The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government.\n\nThe National History Museum of Montevideo is located in the historical residence of General Fructuoso Rivera. It exhibits artifacts related to the history of Uruguay. In a process begun in 1998, the National Museum of Natural History (1837) and the National Museum of Anthropology (1981), merged in 2001, becoming the National Museum of Natural History and Anthropology. In July 2009, the two institutions again became independent. The Historical Museum has annexed eight historical houses in the city, five of which are located in the Ciudad Vieja. One of them, on the same block with the main building, is the historic residence of Antonio Montero, which houses the Museo Romantico.\n\nThe Museo Torres Garc\u00eda is located in the Old Town, and exhibits Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda's unusual portraits of historical icons and cubist paintings akin to those of Picasso and Braque. The museum was established by Manolita Pi\u00f1a Torres, the widow of Torres Garcia, after his death in 1949. She also set up the Garc\u00eda Torres Foundation, a private non-profit organization that organizes the paintings, drawings, original writings, archives, objects and furniture designed by the painter as well as the photographs, magazines and publications related to him.\n\nThere are several other important art museums in Montevideo. The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rod\u00f3 has Uruguay's largest collection of paintings. The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930, the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay, significant with regard to the fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes. In back of the museum is a Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp. The Museo de Historia del Arte, located in the Palacio Municipal, features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period. The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial, in the Ciudad Vieja, has preserved collections of the archaeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archaeologist Antonio Taddei. These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America, painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Museo de Arte Contempo has small but impressive exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture.There are also other types of museums in the city. The Museo del Gaucho y de la Moneda, located in the Centro, has distinctive displays of the historical culture of Uruguay's gauchos, their horse gear, silver work and mate (tea), gourds, and bombillas (drinking straws) in odd designs. The Museo Naval, is located on the eastern waterfront in Buceo and offers exhibits depicting the maritime history of Uruguay. The Museo del Autom\u00f3vil, belonging to the Automobile Club of Uruguay, has a rich collection of vintage cars which includes a 1910 Hupmobile. The Museo y Parque Fernando Garc\u00eda in Carrasco, a transport and automobile museum, includes old horse carriages and some early automobiles. The Castillo Pittamiglio, with an unusual fa\u00e7ade, highlights the eccentric legacy of Humberto Pittamiglio, local alchemist and architect.\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\n\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is home to a number of festivals and carnivals including a Gaucho festival when people ride through the streets on horseback in traditional gaucho gear. The major annual festival is the annual Montevideo Carnival which is part of the national festival of Carnival Week, celebrated throughout Uruguay, with central activities in the capital, Montevideo. Officially, the public holiday lasts for two days on Carnival Monday and Shrove Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, but due to the prominence of the festival, most shops and businesses close for the entire week.\nDuring carnival there are many open-air stage performances and competitions and the streets and houses are vibrantly decorated. \"Tablados\" or popular scenes, both fixed and movable, are erected in the whole city. Notable displays include \"Desfile de las Llamadas\" (\"Parade of the Calls\"), which is a grand united parade held on the south part of downtown, where it used to be a common ritual back in the early 20th century. Due to the scale of the festival, preparation begins as early as December with an election of the \"zonal beauty queens\" to appear in the carnival.\n\n\n==== Sports ====\n\nEstadio Centenario, the national football stadium in Parque Batlle, was opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay's first constitution. In this World Cup, Uruguay won the title game against Argentina by 4 goals to 2. The stadium has 70,000 seats. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums, along with Maracan\u00e3, Wembley Stadium, San Siro, Estadio Azteca, and Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. A museum located within the football stadium has exhibits of memorabilia from Uruguay's 1930 and 1950 World Cup championships. Museum tickets give access to the stadium, stands, locker rooms and playing field.Between 1935 and 1938, the athletics track and the municipal velodrome were completed within Parque Batlle. The Tabar\u00e9 Athletic Club is occasionally made over as a carnival theatre using impermanent materials.\n\nToday the vast majority of teams in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n come from Montevideo, including Nacional, Pe\u00f1arol, Central Espa\u00f1ol, Cerrito, Cerro, Danubio, Defensor Sporting, Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9nix, Liverpool, Wanderers, Racing, River Plate, Club Atl\u00e9tico Torque and Rampla Juniors.\nBesides Estadio Centenario, other stadiums include Estadio Campeon del Siglo, Pe\u00f1arol, Gran Parque Central, Belvedere, Complejo Rentistas, Jardines del Hip\u00f3dromo, Jos\u00e9 Pedro Damiani, \"La Bombonera\", Luis Franzini, Luis Tr\u00f3ccoli and the park stadiums of Abraham Paladino, Alfredo V\u00edctor Viera, Omar Saroldi, Jos\u00e9 Nasazzi, Osvaldo Roberto, Maracan\u00e1 and Palermo.\nThe city has a tradition as host of major international basketball tournaments including the official 1967 FIBA World Cup and the 1988 1997 and 2017 editions of the official Americas Basketball Championship.\nThe Uruguayan Basketball League is headquartered in Montevideo and most of its teams are from the city, including Defensor Sporting, Bigu\u00e1, Aguada, Goes, Malv\u00edn, Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tica, and Trouville. Montevideo is also a centre of rugby; equestrianism, which regained importance in Montevideo after the Maro\u00f1as Racecourse reopened; golf, with the Club de Punta Carretas; and yachting, with the Puerto del Buceo, an ideal place to moor yachts. The Golf Club of Punta Carretas was founded in 1894 covers all the area encircled by the west side of Bulevar Artigas, the Rambla (Montevideo's promenade) and the Parque Rod\u00f3 (Fun Fair).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChurch and state are officially separated since 1916 in Uruguay. The religion with most followers in Montevideo is Roman Catholicism and has been so since the foundation of the city. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montevideo was created as the Apostolic Vicariate of Montevideo in 1830. The vicariate was promoted to the Diocese of Montevideo on 13 July 1878. Pope Leo XIII elevated it to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese on 14 April 1897. The new archdiocese became the Metropolitan of the suffragan sees of Canelones, Florida, Maldonado\u2013Punta del Este, Melo, Mercedes, Minas, Salto, San Jos\u00e9 de Mayo, Tacuaremb\u00f3.\nMontevideo is the only archdiocese in Uruguay and, as its Ordinary, the archbishop is also Primate of the Catholic Church in Uruguay. The archdiocese's mother church and thus seat of its archbishop is Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n y San Felipe y Santiago. As of 2010, the current Archbishop of Montevideo is Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet, SDB, since his appointment on 11 February 2014.Other religious faiths in Montevideo are Protestantism, Umbanda, Judaism, and there are many people who define themselves as Atheists and Agnostics, while others profess \"believing in God but without religion\".\n\n\n==== Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral ====\n\nThe Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Roman Catholic church of Montevideo. It is located in Ciudad Vieja, immediately across Constitution Square from the Cabildo. In 1740 a brick church was built on the site. In 1790, the foundation was laid for the current neoclassical structure. The church was consecrated in 1804. Bicentennial celebrations were held in 2004.\nIn 1897, Pope Leo XIII elevated the church to Metropolitan Cathedral status. Important ceremonies are conducted under the direction of the Archbishop of Montevideo. Weddings and choral concerts are held here and the parish priest conducts the routine functions of the cathedral. In the 19th century, its precincts were also used as a burial place of famous people who died in the city. For decades, the prison and the nearby Punta Carretas parish church were the only major buildings in the neighbourhood.\n\n\n==== Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n ====\n\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (\"Our Lady of the Sacred Heart\"), also known as Iglesia Punta Carretas (\"Punta Carretas Church\"), was built between 1917 and 1927 in the Romanesque Revival style. The church was originally part of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, but is presently in the parish of the Ecclesiastic Curia. Its location is at the corner of Solano Garc\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 Ellauri. It has a nave and aisles. The roof has many vaults. During the construction of the Punta Carretas Shopping complex, major cracks developed in the structure of the church as a result of differential foundation settlement.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is the economic and political centre of the country. Most of the largest and wealthiest businesses in Uruguay have their headquarters in the city. Since the 1990s the city has undergone rapid economic development and modernization, including two of Uruguay's most important buildings\u2014the World Trade Center Montevideo (1998), and Telecommunications Tower (2000), the headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company ANTEL, increasing the city's integration into the global marketplace.The Port of Montevideo, in the northern part of Ciudad Vieja, is one of the major ports of South America and plays a very important role in the city's economy. The port has been growing rapidly and consistently at an average annual rate of 14 percent due to an increase in foreign trade. The city has received a US$20 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to modernize the port, increase its size and efficiency, and enable lower maritime and river transportation costs.The most important state-owned companies headquartered in Montevideo are: AFE (railways), ANCAP (Energy), Administracion Nacional de Puertos (Ports), ANTEL (telecommunications), BHU (savings and loan), BROU (bank), BSE (insurance), OSE (water & sewage), UTE (electricity). These companies operate under public law, using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called Ente Autonomo (\"autonomous entity\"). The government also owns part of other companies operating under private law, such as those owned wholly or partially by the CND (National Development Corporation).\nBanking has traditionally been one of the strongest service export sectors in Uruguay: the country was once dubbed \"the Switzerland of America\", mainly for its banking sector and stability, although that stability has been threatened in the 21st century by the recent global economic climate. The largest bank in Uruguay is Banco Republica (BROU), based in Montevideo. Almost 20 private banks, most of them branches of international banks, operate in the country (Banco Santander, BBVA, ABN AMRO, Citibank, among others). There are also a myriad of brokers and financial-services bureaus, among them Ficus Capital, Galfin Sociedad de Bolsa, Europa Sociedad de Bolsa, Dar\u00edo Cukier, GBU, Horde\u00f1ana & Asociados Sociedad de Bolsa, etc.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism accounts for much of Uruguay's economy. Tourism in Montevideo is centered in the Ciudad Vieja area, which includes the city's oldest buildings, several museums, art galleries, and nightclubs, with Sarand\u00ed Street and the Mercado del Puerto being the most frequented venues of the old city. On the edge of Ciudad Vieja, Plaza Independencia is surrounded by many sights, including the Sol\u00eds Theatre and the Palacio Salvo; the plaza also constitutes one end of 18 de Julio Avenue, the city's most important tourist destination outside of Ciudad Vieja. Apart from being a shopping street, the avenue is noted for its Art Deco buildings, three important public squares, the Gaucho Museum, the Palacio Municipal and many other sights. The avenue leads to the Obelisk of Montevideo; beyond that is Parque Batlle, which along with the Parque Prado is another important tourist destination. Along the coast, the Fortaleza del Cerro, the Rambla (the coastal avenue), 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) of sandy beaches, and Punta Gorda attract many tourists, as do the Barrio Sur and Palermo barrios.The Ministry of Tourism offers a two-and-a-half-hour city tour and the Montevideo Tourist Guide Association offers guided tours in English, Italian, Portuguese and German. Apart from these, many private companies offer organized city tours.\nMost tourists to the city come from Argentina, Brazil and Europe, with the number of visitors from elsewhere in Latin America and from the United States growing every year, thanks to an increasing number of international airline arrivals at Carrasco International Airport as well as cruises that arrive into the port of Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\nMontevideo has over 50 hotels, mostly located in the city centre or along the beachfront of the Rambla de Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nMontevideo is the heartland of retailing in Uruguay. The city has become the principal centre of business and real estate, including many expensive buildings and modern towers for residences and offices, surrounded by extensive green spaces. In 1985, the first shopping centre in Rio de la Plata, Montevideo Shopping was built. In 1994, with building of three more shopping complexes such as the Shopping Tres Cruces, Portones Shopping, and Punta Carretas Shopping, the business map of the city changed dramatically. The creation of shopping complexes brought a major change in the habits of the people of Montevideo. Global firms such as McDonald's and Burger King etc. are firmly established in Montevideo.\nApart from the big shopping complexes, the main retailing venues of the city are: most of 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro and Cord\u00f3n barrios, a length of Agraciada Avenue in the Paso de Molino area of Belvedere, a length of Arenal Grande St. and the\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nOut of the 100 radio stations found in Uruguay, 40 of them are in Montevideo. The city has a vibrant artistic and literary community. The press enjoyed full freedom until the advent of the Civic-military dictatorship (1973\u20131985); this freedom returned on 1 March 1985, as part of the restoration of democracy.\nSome of the important newspapers published in the city are: Brecha, La Republica, El Observador, El Pa\u00eds, Gaceta Comercial and La Diaria. El D\u00eda was the most prestigious paper in Uruguay, founded in 1886 by Jos\u00e9 Batlle, who would later go on to become President of Uruguay. The paper ceased production in the early 1990s. All television stations have their headquarters in Montevideo, for example: Saeta Channel 10, Teledoce, Channel 4 and National Television (Channel 5)\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte (DNT), part of the national Ministry of Transport and Public Works, is responsible for the organization and development of Montevideo's transport infrastructure. A bus service network covers the entire city. An international bus station, the Tres Cruces Bus Station, is located on the lower level of the Tres Cruces Shopping Center, on the side of Artigas Boulevard. This terminal, along with the Baltazar Brum Bus Terminal (or Rio Branco Terminal) by the Port of Montevideo, handles the long distance and intercity bus routes connecting to destinations within Uruguay.\n\nThe State Railways Administration of Uruguay (AFE) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the Empalme Olmos, San Jose and Florida. These lines operate to major suburban areas of Canelones, San Jos\u00e9 and Florida. Within the Montevideo city limits, local trains stop at Lorenzo Carnelli, Yatai (Step Mill), Sayago, Columbus (line to San Jose and Florida), Pe\u00f1arol and Manga (line Empalme Olmos) stations. The historic 19th century General Artigas Central Station located in the neighbourhood of Aguada, six blocks from the central business district, was abandoned 1 March 2003 and remains closed. A new station, 500 metres (1,600 ft) north of the old one and part of the Tower of Communications modern complex, has taken over the rail traffic.Carrasco International Airport (IATA: MVD, ICAO: SUMU), which serves Montevideo, is located 19 km (12 mi) from the city centre. Several international airlines operate there. The airport serves over 1,500,000 passengers annually. \u00c1ngel S. Adami Airport is a private airport operated by minor charter companies.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Montevideo, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 65 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 18% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.2 km, while 6% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nThe port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbour entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of R\u00edo de la Plata, Buenos Aires.\nThe main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, until the 21st century, physical changes had ceased, and since that time the area had degraded due to national economic stagnation.The port's proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.Every year more than one hundred cruises arrive, bringing tourists to Montevideo by public or private tours.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Public education ===\nThe University of the Republic is the country's largest and most important university, with a student body of 81,774, according to the census of 2007. It was founded on 18 July 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its current Rector is Dr. Rodrigo Arocena. The university houses 14 faculties (departments) and various institutes and schools. Many eminent Uruguayans have graduated from this university, including Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Jos\u00e9 Luis Massera, Gabriel Paternain, Mario Wschebor, Roman Fresnedo Siri, Carlos Ott and Eladio Dieste\nThe process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time.\n\n\n=== Private education ===\nThe largest private university in Uruguay, is also located in Montevideo. ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942, and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996, becoming the second private educational institution in the country to achieve that status. It is a member of World ORT, an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nThe university has about 8,000 students, distributed among 5 faculties and institutes, mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering. Its current rector as of 2010 is Dr. Jorge A. Gr\u00fcnberg.\nThe Montevideo Crandon Institute is an American School of missionary origin and the main Methodist educational institution in Uruguay. Founded in 1879 and supported by the Women's Society of the Methodist Church of the United States, it is one of the most traditional and emblematic institutions in the city inculcating John Wesley's values. Its alumni include presidents, senators, ambassadors and Nobel Prize winners, along with musicians, scientists, and others. The Montevideo Crandon Institute boasts of being the first academic institution in South America where a home economics course was taught.\n\nThe Christian Brothers of Ireland Stella Maris College is a private, co-educational, not-for-profit Catholic school located in the wealthy residential southeastern neighbourhood of Carrasco. Established in 1955, it is regarded as one of the best high schools in the country, blending a rigorous curriculum with strong extracurricular activities. The school's headmaster, history professor Juan Pedro Toni, is a member of the Stella Maris Board of Governors and the school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Its long list of distinguished former pupils includes economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school's alumni club.\nAlso in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo, one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, founded in 1908 with \"the object of giving children a complete education, both intellectual and moral, based upon the ideas and principles of the best schools in The British Isles\".\nThe School is governed by the Board of Governors, elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay, whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay. Prominent alumni include former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry Herr\u00e1n and Gabriel Gurm\u00e9ndez Armand-Ugon.\nLocated in Cordon, St.Brendan's school, previously named St.Catherine's is a non-profit civil association, which has a solid institutional culture with a clear vision of the future. It is knowned for being one of the best schools in the country, joining students from the wealthiest parts of Montevideo, such us, Punta Carretas, Pocitos, Malvin and Carrasco.\nSt. Brendan's School is a bilingual, non-denominational school that promotes a pedagogical constructivist approach focused on the child as a whole. In this approach, understanding is built from the connections children make between their own prior knowledge and the learning experiences, thus developing critical thinking skills. It is also the only school in the country implementing the three International Baccalaureate Programmes. These are:\n\nDiploma Programme \u2013 Pre-University course for students aged 16 to 19. The Diploma Programme is a two-year curriculum.\nMYP -Middle Years Programme. For students aged 12 to 16.\nPYP \u2013 Primary Years Programme. For students aged 3 to 12.Other educational institutions of note include Colegio Ingles, Instituto Preuniversitario Salesiano Juan XXIII, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Montevideo, Ivy Thomas, German School of Montevideo and Colegio Preuniversitario Ciudad de San Felipe.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nIn Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by polyclinics and hospitals or sanatorios. The term hospital is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while sanatorio is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.\n\n\n=== Public hospitals ===\nHospital de Cl\u00ednicas \"Dr. Manuel Quintela\" is a University Hospital attached to the University of the Republic, and is located on Avenida Italia. It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928\u20131929 and has a surface area of 110,000 square metres (1,200,000 sq ft) on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr. Hugo Villar, who was a considerable influence on the institution.\nHospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaran\u00ed and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of Jos\u00e9 Toribio (son of Tom\u00e1s Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaran\u00ed street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaran\u00ed and 25 de Mayo) and Juli\u00e1n Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Est\u00e9vez in 1798.Hospital Pereira Rossell was founded in 1908 and was built on land donated in late 1900 by Alexis Rossell y Rius and Dolores Pereira de Rossell. It was the city's first pediatric hospital, and shortly afterwards the addition of an obstetric and gynaecological clinic in 1915 made it the first maternity hospital as well. Later, the hospital received a donation from Dr. Enrique Pouey for a radiotherapy unit.\nHospital Vilardeb\u00f3 is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist Teodoro Vilardeb\u00f3 Matuliche, it opened 21 May 1880. The hospital was originally one of the best of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel. It has an emergency service, outpatient, clinic and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others. The average patient age is 30 years; more than half of the patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.\nOther public polyclinics and hospitals of note include the Hospital Saint Bois, founded 18 November 1928, which consists of a General Hospital and Eye Hospital; the Pasteur Hospital in La Uni\u00f3n neighbourhood; the Hospital Espa\u00f1ol, which was founded in 1886, passed to the private sector in the 20th century, closed in 2004 and was restored and reinaugurated in 2007 as the municipal Juan Jose Crottogini Polyclinic; the National Cancer Institute; and the National Institute of Trauma and Orthopedics.\n\n\n=== Private healthcare ===\nPrivate healthcare is offered by many private health insurance companies, each of which has one or more polyclinics and owns or is associated with one or more hospitals. Private medical facilities of note include the Hospital Brit\u00e1nico, the Italian Hospital of Montevideo, Mutualista CASMU's Sanatoria I, II, III and IV, the Evangelical Hospital, M\u00e9dica Uruguaya, Sanatorio de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, Sanatorios del C\u00edrculo Cat\u00f3lico, Sanatorio Casa de Galicia and Sanatorio GREMCA.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nMontevideo is twinned with:\n\nMontevideo is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities since 12 October 1982.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nAlbes, Edward.

        "wiki": "Montevideo (Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u03b2i\u02c8\u00f0eo]) is the capital and largest city of Uruguay. According to the 2011 census, the city proper has a population of 1,319,108 (about one-third of the country's total population) in an area of 201 square kilometres (78 sq mi). The southernmost capital city in the Americas, Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the R\u00edo de la Plata.\nThe city was established in 1724 by a Spanish soldier, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, as a strategic move amidst the Spanish-Portuguese dispute over the platine region. It was also under brief British rule in 1807. Montevideo is the seat of the administrative headquarters of Mercosur and ALADI, Latin America's leading trade blocs, a position that entailed comparisons to the role of Brussels in Europe.The 2019 Mercer's report on quality of life, rated Montevideo first in Latin America, a rank the city has consistently held since 2005. As of 2010, Montevideo was the 19th largest city economy in the continent and 9th highest income earner among major cities. In 2020, it has a projected GDP of $49.7 billion, with a per capita of $28,385.In 2018, it was classified as a beta global city ranking eighth in Latin America and 84th in the world. Montevideo hosted every match during the first FIFA World Cup, in 1930. Described as a \"vibrant, eclectic place with a rich cultural life\", and \"a thriving tech center and entrepreneurial culture\", Montevideo ranked eighth in Latin America on the 2013 MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.In 2014, it was also regarded as the fifth most gay-friendly metropolis in the world and the first in Latin America. It is the hub of commerce and higher education in Uruguay as well as its chief port. The city is also the financial hub of Uruguay and the cultural anchor of a metropolitan area with a population of around 2 million.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are several explanations about the word Montevideo. All agree that \"Monte\" refers to the Cerro de Montevideo, the hill situated across the Bay of Montevideo, but there is disagreement about the etymological origin of the \"video\" part.\n\nMonte vide eu (\"I saw a mount\") is the most widespread belief but is rejected by the majority of experts, who consider it unlikely because it involves a mix of dialects. The name would come from a Portuguese expression which means \"I saw a mount\", wrongly pronounced by an anonymous sailor belonging to the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes on catching sight of the Cerro de Montevideo.\nMonte Vidi: This hypothesis comes from the \"Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n\" (Navigational Calendar) of boatswain Francisco de Albo, member of the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes, who wrote, \"Tuesday of the said [month of January 1520] we were on the straits of Cape Santa Mar\u00eda [now Punta del Este], from where the coast runs east to west, and the terrain is sandy, and at the right of the cape there is a mountain like a hat to which we gave the name \"Montevidi\".\" This is the oldest Spanish document that mentions the promontory with a name similar to the one that designates the city, but it does not contain any mention of the alleged cry \"Monte vide eu.\"\nMonte-VI-D-E-O (Monte VI De Este a Oeste): According to Rolando Laguarda Tr\u00edas, professor of history, the Spaniards annotated the geographic location on a map or Portolan chart, so that the mount/hill is the VI (6th) mount observable on the coast, navigating R\u00edo de la Plata from east to west. With the passing of time, these words were unified to \"Montevideo\". No conclusive evidence has been found to confirm this academic hypothesis nor can it be asserted with certainty which were the other five mounts observable before the Cerro.\nMonte Ovidio (Monte Santo Ovidio), a less widespread hypothesis of a religious origin, stems from an interpolation in the aforementioned Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n of Fernando de Albo, where it is asserted \"corruptly now called Santo Vidio\" when they refer to the hat-like mount which they named Monte Vidi (that is, the Cerro de Montevideo). Ovidio (Saint Ovidius) was the third bishop of the Portuguese city of Braga, where he was always revered; a monument to him was erected there in 1505. Given the relationship that the Portuguese had with the discovery and foundation of Montevideo, and despite the fact that this hypothesis, like the previous ones, lacks conclusive documentation, there have been those who linked the name of Santo Ovidio or Vidio (appearing on some maps of the time) with the subsequent derivation of the name \"Montevideo\" given to the region since the early years of the 16th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBetween 1680 and 1683, Portugal founded the city of Colonia do Sacramento in the region across the bay from Buenos Aires. This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca of Portugal built the Montevieu fort.\nA Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were known as Guanches or Canarians. There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name of Jorge Burgues.A census of the city's inhabitants was performed in 1724 and then a plan was drawn delineating the city and designating it as San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo, later shortened to Montevideo. The census counted fifty families of Galician and Canary Islands origin, more than 1000 indigenous people, mostly Guaran\u00ed, as well as Black African slaves of Bantu origin.A few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the R\u00edo de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River, competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata brought it in confrontations with the city of Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was taken over to be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.\nIn 1776, Spain made Montevideo its main naval base (Real Apostadero de Marina) for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, Fernando Po, and the Falklands.Until the end of the 18th century, Montevideo remained a fortified area, today known as Ciudad Vieja.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nOn 3 February 1807, British troops under the command of General Samuel Auchmuty and Admiral Charles Stirling occupied the city during the Battle of Montevideo (1807), but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the same year on 2 September when John Whitelocke was forced to surrender to troops formed by forces of the Banda Oriental\u2014roughly the same area as modern Uruguay\u2014and of Buenos Aires. After this conflict, the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de El\u00edo opposed the new viceroy Santiago de Liniers, and created a government Junta when the Peninsular War started in Spain, in defiance of Liniers. El\u00edo disestablished the Junta when Liniers was replaced by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros.\nDuring the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo. During that year and the next, Uruguayan revolutionary Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain. In 1811, the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo, which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution. The siege was lifted at the end of that year, when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region.The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814. In 1816, Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821, it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil. It was named Imperial City by Emperor Pedro I when the city was part of the Empire of Brazil as capital of the Cisplatina province. Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the Treinta y Tres Orientales (\"Thirty-Three Orientals\") re-established the independence of the region in 1825. Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828, with Montevideo as the nation's capital. In 1829, the demolition of the city's fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja, referred to as the \"Ciudad Nueva\" (\"new city\"). Urban expansion, however, moved very slowly because of the events that followed.\n\nUruguay's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between Manuel Oribe and Fructuoso Rivera, the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the Empire of Brazil under the command of Lavalleja, each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction. Politics were divided between Oribe's Blancos (\"whites\"), represented by the National Party, and Rivera's Colorados (\"reds\"), represented by the Colorado Party, with each party's name taken from the colour of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the Guerra Grande, which lasted until 1851.\nThe city of Montevideo suffered a siege of eight years between 1843 and 1851, during which it was supplied by sea with British and French support. Oribe, with the support of the then conservative Governor of Buenos Aires Province Juan Manuel de Rosas, besieged the Colorados in Montevideo, where the latter were supported by the French Legion, the Italian Legion, the Basque Legion and battalions from Brazil. Finally, in 1851, with the additional support of Argentine rebels who opposed Rosas, the Colorados defeated Oribe. The fighting, however, resumed in 1855, when the Blancos came to power, which they maintained until 1865. Thereafter, the Colorado Party regained power, which they retained until past the middle of the 20th century.\nAfter the end of hostilities, a period of growth and expansion started for the city. In 1853 a stagecoach bus line was established joining Montevideo with the newly formed settlement of Uni\u00f3n and the first natural gas street lights were inaugurated. From 1854 to 1861 the first public sanitation facilities were constructed. In 1856 the Teatro Sol\u00eds was inaugurated, 15 years after the beginning of its construction. By Decree, in December 1861 the areas of Aguada and Cord\u00f3n were incorporated to the growing Ciudad Nueva (New City). In 1866, an underwater telegraph line connected the city with Buenos Aires. The statue of Peace, La Paz, was erected on a column in Plaza Cagancha and the building of the Postal Service as well as the bridge of Paso Molino were inaugurated in 1867.In 1868, the horse-drawn tram company Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tranv\u00edas al Paso del Molino y Cerro created the first lines connecting Montevideo with Uni\u00f3n, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro, at the time called Cosmopolis. In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras. During the same year and the next, the neighbourhoods Col\u00f3n, Nuevo Par\u00eds and La Comercial were founded. The Sunday market of Trist\u00e1n Narvaja Street was established in Cord\u00f3n in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, Bulevar Circunvalaci\u00f3n was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas, going up to the north end of the city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed to Artigas Boulevard (its current name) in 1885. By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area Los Pocitos was incorporated to the Nov\u00edsima Ciudad (Most New City).The first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas operated ones in 1886. The Hip\u00f3dromo de Maro\u00f1as started operating in 1888, and the neighbourhoods of Reus del Sur, Reus del Norte and Conciliaci\u00f3n were inaugurated in 1889. The new building of the School of Arts and Trades, as well as Zabala Square in Ciudad Vieja were inaugurated in 1890, followed by the Italian Hospital in 1891. In the same year, the village of Pe\u00f1arol was founded. Other neighbourhoods that were founded were Belgrano and Belvedere in 1892, Jacinto Vera in 1895 and Trouville in 1897. In 1894 the new port was constructed, and in 1897, the Central Railway Station of Montevideo was inaugurated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, many Europeans (particularly Spaniards and Italians but also thousands from Central Europe) immigrated to the city. In 1908, 30% of the city's population of 300,000 was foreign-born. In that decade the city expanded quickly: new neighbourhoods were created and many separate settlements were annexed to the city, among which were the Villa del Cerro, Pocitos, the Prado and Villa Col\u00f3n. The Rod\u00f3 Park and the Estadio Gran Parque Central were also established, which served as poles of urban development.During the early 20th century, Uruguay saw huge social changes with repercussions primarily in urban areas. Among these changes were the right of divorce (1907) and women's right to vote.The 1910s saw the construction of Montevideo's Rambla; strikes by tram workers, bakers and port workers; the inauguration of electric trams; the creation of the Municipal Intendencias; and the inauguration of the new port.In 1913, the city limits were extended around the entire gulf. The previously independent localities of the Villa del Cerro and La Teja were annexed to Montevideo, becoming two of its neighborhoods.During the 1920s, the equestrian statue of Artigas was installed in Plaza Independencia; the Palacio Legislativo was built; the Spanish Plus Ultra flying boat arrived (the first airplane to fly from Spain to Latin America, 1926); prominent politician and former president Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez died (1929); and ground was broken (1929) for the Estadio Centenario (completed 1930).During World War II, a famous incident involving the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee took place in Punta del Este, 200 kilometers (120 mi) from Montevideo. After the Battle of the River Plate with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy on 13 December 1939, the Graf Spee retreated to Montevideo's port, which was considered neutral at the time. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on 17 December. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. The eagle figurehead of the Graf Spee was salvaged on 10 February 2006; to protect the feelings of those still sensitive to Nazi Germany, the swastika on the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water.\n\nUruguay began to stagnate economically in the mid-1950s; Montevideo began a decline, later exacerbated by widespread social and political violence beginning in 1968 (including the emergence of the guerrilla Movimiento de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional-Tupamaros) and by the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985). There were major problems with supply; the immigration cycle was reversed.\nFrom the 1960s to the end of the dictatorship in 1985, around one hundred people died or disappeared because of the political violence. From 1974 another hundred Uruguayans disappeared also in Argentina. In 1980, the dictatorship proposed a new constitution. The project was submitted to referendum and rejected in the first polls since 1971, with 58% of the votes against and 42% in favour. The result weakened the military and triggered its fall, allowing the return of democracy.In the 1980s, Pope John Paul II visited the city twice. In April 1987, as head of state of Vatican, he signed a mediation agreement for the conflict of the Beagle Channel. He also held a large mass in Tres Cruces, declaring the cross located behind the altar as a monument. In 1988, he returned to the country, visiting Montevideo, Florida, Salto and Melo.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe 2002 Uruguay banking crisis affected several industries of Montevideo. In 2017, the city has maintained 15 years of economic growth, with a GDP of $44 billion, and a GDP per capita of $25,900.Montevideo has consistently been rated as having the highest quality of life of any city in Latin America: by 2015 it held this rank every year during the decade through 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMontevideo is situated on the north shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata, the arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the south coast of Uruguay from the north coast of Argentina; Buenos Aires lies 230 kilometres (140 mi) west on the Argentine side. The Santa Luc\u00eda River forms a natural border between Montevideo and San Jos\u00e9 Department to its west. To the city's north and east is Canelones Department, with the stream of Carrasco forming the eastern natural border. The coastline forming the city's southern border is interspersed with rocky protrusions and sandy beaches. The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbour, the nation's largest and one of the largest in the Southern Cone, and the finest natural port in the region, functioning as a crucial component of the Uruguayan economy and foreign trade. Various streams criss-cross the town and empty into the Bay of Montevideo. Its coastline near the emptying rivers are heavily polluted.The city has an average elevation of 43 metres (141 ft). Its highest elevations are two hills: the Cerro de Montevideo and the Cerro de la Victoria, with the highest point, the peak of Cerro de Montevideo, crowned by a fortress, the Fortaleza del Cerro at a height of 134 m (440 ft). Closest cities by road are Las Piedras to the north and the so-called Ciudad de la Costa (a conglomeration of coastal towns) to the east, both in the range of 20 to 25 km (16 mi) from the city center. The approximate distances to the neighbouring department capitals by road are, 90 km (56 mi) to San Jose de Mayo (San Jose Department) and 46 km (29 mi) to Canelones (Canelones Department).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontevideo enjoys a humid subtropical climate (Cfa, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). The city has mild winters (June to September), warm-hot summers (December to March) and volatile springs (October and November); there are numerous thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout the year, reaching around 950 millimetres (37 in).Winters are generally cool, wet, windy and overcast. During this season, there are bursts of icy and relatively dry winds of continental polar air masses, giving an unpleasant chilly feeling to the everyday life of the city. Frosts occur few times during winter, generally not falling below 28\u00b0 F (-2\u00b0 C) because of the oceanic influence that moderates the temperature; few miles away from the coast, frosts are more common and colder. Rainfall and sleet are a frequent winter occurrence, but snowfall is extremely rare: flurries have been recorded only four times but with no accumulation, the last one on 13 July 1930 during the inaugural match of the World Cup, (the other three snowfalls were in 1850, 1853 and 1917); the alleged 1980 Carrasco snowfall was actually a hailstorm.Summers are warm-hot and humid, with less wind than other seasons. During this season, a moderate wind often blows from the sea in the evenings which has a pleasant cooling effect on the city, in contrast to the more-severe summer heat of nearby cities like Buenos Aires. Heat waves come with the north winds, which bring humid and hot air masses from the tropical interior of the continent. These warm periods are usually followed by thunderstorms, generated by cold fronts of the southwest that lowers temperatures considerably. This phenomenon is regional, and can occur several times all year long.\nMontevideo has an annual average temperature of 16.7 \u00b0C (62.1 \u00b0F). The lowest recorded temperature is \u22125.6 \u00b0C (21.9 \u00b0F) while the highest is 42.8 \u00b0C (109.0 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions and barrios ===\n\nAs of 2010, the city of Montevideo has been divided into 8 political municipalities (Municipios), referred to with the letters from A to G, including CH, each presided over by a mayor elected by the citizens registered in the constituency. This division, according to the Municipality of Montevideo, \"aims to advance political and administrative decentralization in the department of Montevideo, with the aim of deepening the democratic participation of citizens in governance.\" The head of each Municipio is called an alcalde or (if female) alcaldesa.Of much greater importance is the division of the city into 62 barrios: neighbourhoods or wards. Many of the city's barrios\u2014such as Sayago, Ituzaing\u00f3 and Pocitos\u2014were previously geographically separate settlements, later absorbed by the growth of the city. Others grew up around certain industrial sites, including the salt-curing works of Villa del Cerro and the tanneries in Nuevo Par\u00eds. Each barrio has its own identity, geographic location and socio-cultural activities. A neighbourhood of great significance is Ciudad Vieja, that was surrounded by a protective wall until 1829. This area contains most important buildings of the colonial era and early decades of independence.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n\nThe architecture of Montevideo ranges from Neoclassical buildings such as the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral to the Postmodern style of the World Trade Center Montevideo or the 158-metre (518 ft) ANTEL Telecommunication Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the country. The Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the Palacio Salvo dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building facades in the Old Town reflect the city's extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the Legislative Palace, the City Hall, Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower. The most notable sports stadium is the Estadio Centenario within Parque Batlle. Parque Batlle, Parque Rod\u00f3 and Parque Prado are Montevideo's three great parks.The Pocitos district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the \"Edificio Panamericano\" designed by Raul Sichero, and the \"Positano\" and \"El Pilar\" designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis Garc\u00eda Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighbourhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle class residents.\n\n\n==== Palacio Legislativo ====\n\nThe Palacio Legislativo in Aguada, the north of the city centre, is currently the seat of the Uruguayan Parliament. Construction started in 1904 and was sponsored by the government of President Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. It was designed by Italian architects Vittorio Meano and Gaetano Moretti, who planned the building's interior. Among the notable contributors to the project was sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni, who contributed numerous reliefs and allegorical sculptures.\n\n\n==== World Trade Center Montevideo ====\n\nWorld Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998, but work was completed in 2009. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998. It has 22 floors and 17,100 square metres of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and 27,000 square metres (290,000 sq ft) of space. The 6,300-square-metre (68,000 sq ft) World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a centre of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St. Among the establishments on the plaza are Burger King, Walrus, Bamboo, Asia de Cuba, Gardenia Mvd, and La Claraboya Cafe.\nThe Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social place. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor Pablo Atchugarry. World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and 53,500 square metres (576,000 sq ft) of space is under construction as of 2010.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications Tower ====\n\nTorre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the 158 metres (518 ft), 37-floor headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company, ANTEL, and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect Carlos Ott. It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by American Bridge and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.\nWhen its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40 million, plus US$25 million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65 million price into US$102 million.\n\n\n==== Ciudad Vieja (Old City) ====\n\nCiudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent barrio of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and night-clubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.\n\nMontevideo's most important plaza is Plaza Independencia, located between Ciudad Vieja and downtown Montevideo. It starts with the Gateway of The Citadel at one end and ends at the beginning of 18 de Julio Avenue. It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city. Several notable buildings are located here.  The Sol\u00eds Theatre is Uruguay's oldest theatre. It was built in 1856 and is currently owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theatre, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by Philippe Starck. The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theatre reopened in August of that year. The plaza is also the site of the offices of the President of Uruguay (both the Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower). The Artigas Mausoleum is located at the centre of the plaza. Statues include that of Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, hero of Uruguay's independence movement; an honour guard keeps vigil at the Mausoleum.Palacio Salvo, at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands 100 metres (330 ft) high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confiter\u00eda La Giralda, renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez wrote his tango \"La Cumparsita\" (1917.) Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.Also of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (or Plaza Matriz). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the Cabildo\u2014the seat of colonial government\u2014and the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral. The cathedral is the burial place of Fructuoso Rivera, Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Venancio Flores. Another notable square is Plaza Zabala with the equestrian statue of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On its south side, Palacio Taranco, once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto, another major tourist destination.\n\n\n==== Parque Batlle ====\n\nParque Batlle (formerly: Parque de los Aliados, translation: \"Park of the Allies\") is a major public central park, located south of Avenida Italia and north of Avenue Rivera. Along with Parque Prado and Parque Rod\u00f3 it is one of three large parks that dominate Montevideo. The park and surrounding area constitute one of the 62 neighbourhoods (barrios) of the city. The barrio of Parque Batlle is one of seven coastal barrios, the others being Buceo, Carrasco, Malvin, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, and Punta Gorda. The current barrio of Parque Battle includes four former districts: Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and Batlle Park itself and borders the neighbourhoods of La Blanqueada, Tres Cruces, Pocitos and Buceo. It has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income. Villa Dolores, a subdistrict of Parque Batlle, took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Do\u00f1a Dolores Pereira de Rossel. On their grounds, they started a private collection of animals that became a zoological garden and was passed to the city in 1919; in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises.\n\nParque Batlle is named in honour of Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915. The park was originally proposed by an Act of March 1907, which also projected wide boulevards and avenues. French landscape architect, Carlos Thays, began the plantings in 1911. In 1918, the park was named Parque de los Aliados, following the victory of the Allies of World War I. On 5 May 1930, after significant expansion, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, in memory of the prominent politician and president, who had died in 1929. The park was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975. As of 2010, the park covers an area of 60 hectares (150 acres) and is considered the \"lung\" of the Montevideo city due to the large variety of trees planted here.The Estadio Centenario, the national football stadium, opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, and later hosted several other sporting grounds of note (see Sports).\nIn 1934, sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni's \"La Carreta\", a bronze monument on granite base, was installed on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario. One of several statues in the park, it depicts yoked oxen pulling a loaded wagon. It was designated a national monument in 1976. Another statue on the same side of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron.\nOn the west side of Parque Batlle, on Artigas Boulevard, the 1938 Obelisk of Montevideo is a monument dedicated to those who created the first Constitution. The work of sculptor Jos\u00e9 Luis Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn (1891\u20131975), it is a three-sided granite obelisk, 40 metres (130 ft) tall, with bronze statues on its three sides, representing \"Law\", \"Liberty\", and \"Force\", respectively. It has been a National Heritage Site since 1976.\n\n\n==== Parque Prado ====\n\nEstablished in 1873, the largest of Montevideo's six main public parks is the 1.06-square-kilometre (260-acre) Parque Prado. Located in the northern part of the city, the Miguelete Creek flows through the park and the neighbourhood and of the same name. It is surrounded by the avenues Agraciada, Obes Lucas, Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez, Luis Alberto de Herrera and by the streets Castro and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyes.\nThe most frequented areas of the park are the Rosedal, a public rose garden with pergolas, the Botanical Garden, the area around the Hotel del Prado, as well as the Rural del Prado, a seasonal cattle and farm animal fairground. The Rosedal contains four pergolas, eight domes, and a fountain; its 12,000 roses were imported from France in 1910. There are several jogging paths along the Miguelete river.\nThe Presidential Residence is located behind the Botanical Gardens. Established in 1930, Juan Manuel Blanes Museum is situated in the Palladian villa, a National Heritage Site since 1975, and includes a Japanese garden. The Professor Atilio Lombardo Museum and Botanical Gardens were established in 1902. The National Institute of Physical Climatology and its observatory are also in the Prado.\n\n\n==== Parque Rod\u00f3 ====\n\nParque Rod\u00f3 is both a barrio (neighbourhood) of Montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighbourhood itself and belongs to Punta Carretas. The name \"Rod\u00f3\" commemorates Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, an important Uruguayan writer whose monument is in the southern side of the main park. The park was conceived as a French-style city park. Apart from the main park area which is delimited by Sarmiento Avenue to the south, Parque Rod\u00f3 includes an amusement park; the Estadio Luis Franzini, belonging to Defensor Sporting; the front lawn of the Faculty of Engineering and a strip west of the Club de Golf de Punta Carretas that includes the Canteras (\"quarry\") del Parque Rod\u00f3, the Teatro de Verano (\"summer theatre\") and the Lago (\"lake\") del Parque Rod\u00f3.On the east side of the main park area is the National Museum of Visual Arts. On this side, a street market takes place every Sunday. On the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children. An area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography. West of the park, across the coastal avenue Rambla Presidente Wilson, stretches Ramirez Beach. Directly west of the main park are, and belonging to Parque Rod\u00f3 barrio, is the former Parque Hotel, now called Edif\u00edcio Mercosur, seat of the parliament of the members countries of the Mercosur. During the guerilla war the Tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area, including the old hotel.\n\n\n==== Forts ====\nThe first set of subsidiary forts were planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at Colonia del Sacramento. However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship Nossa Senhora de Oliveara. They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.\n\n\n===== Fortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro) =====\n\nFortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839. It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931 and has housed a military museum since 1916. Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.\n\n\n==== Punta Brava Lighthouse ====\n\nPunta Brava Lighthouse (Faro Punta Brava), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876. The lighthouse is 21 metres (69 ft) high and its light reaches 24 km (15 mi) away, with a flash every ten seconds. In 1962, the lighthouse became electric. The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Ingl\u00e9s Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Luc\u00eda River.\n\n\n==== Rambla of Montevideo ====\n\nThe Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word rambla is \"avenue\" or \"watercourse\", but in the Americas it is mostly used as \"coastal avenue\", and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the R\u00edo de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas (\"United Nations\"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.\n\nThe Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even\u2014in a special area\u2014skateboard. Its 27-kilometre (17 mi) length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.Montevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city. Its best known beaches are Ram\u00edrez, Pocitos, Carrasco, Buceo and Malv\u00edn. Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.\n\n\n==== Cemeteries ====\n\nThere are five large cemeteries in Montevideo, all administered by the \"F\u00fanebre y Necr\u00f3polis\" annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Juan Manuel Blanes, Fran\u00e7ois Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont (Isidore Ducasse), Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, and Juan Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn.\nThe other large cemeteries are the Cementerio del Buceo, Cementerio del Cerro, and Cementerio Paso Molino.\nThe British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Brit\u00e1nico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighborhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Mr. Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors, contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine, Henry de Costa, is buried here.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nIn 1860, Montevideo had 57,913 inhabitants including a number of people of African origin who had been brought as slaves and had gained their freedom around the middle of the century. By 1880, the population had quadrupled, mainly because of the great European immigration. In 1908, its population had grown massively to 309,331 inhabitants. In the course of the 20th century the city continued to receive large numbers of European immigrants, especially Spanish and Italian, followed by French, Germans, English, Irish, Swiss, Austrians, Poles, Dutch, Greek, Hungarians, Russians, Croats, Lebanese, Armenians, and Jews of various origins. The last wave of immigrants occurred between 1945 and 1955.According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay's total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of \u22121.5 per thousand. Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975\u20131985, which showed a rate of \u22125.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004. However, mortality continued to fall with life expectancy at birth for both sexes increasing by 1.73 years.In the census of 2011, Montevideo had a population of 1,319,108.\nSource: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica de Uruguay\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Intendencia de Montevideo ===\n\nThe Municipality of Montevideo was first created by a legal act of 18 December 1908. The municipality's first mayor (1909\u20131911) was Daniel Mu\u00f1oz. Municipalities were abolished by the Uruguayan Constitution of 1918, effectively restored during the 1933 military coup of Gabriel Terra, and formally restored by the 1934 Constitution. The 1952 Constitution again decided to abolish the municipalities; it came into effect in February 1955. Municipalities were replaced by departmental councils, which consisted of a collegiate executive board with 7 members from Montevideo and 5 from the interior region. However, municipalities were revived under the 1967 Constitution and have operated continuously since that time.\nSince 1990, Montevideo has been partially decentralized into 18 areas; administration and services for each area is provided by its Zonal Community Center (Centro Comunal Zonal, CCZ), which is subordinate to the Municipality of Montevideo. The boundaries of the municipal districts of Montevideo were created on 12 July 1993, and successively amended on 19 October 1993, 6 June 1994 and 10 November 1994.\nThe city government of Montevideo performs several functions, including maintaining communications with the public, promoting culture, organizing society, caring for the environment and regulating traffic. Its headquarters is the Palacio Municipal on 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro area of Montevideo.Another body, the Junta Departamental, or the Congress of Montevideo, governs the Department of Montevideo. The Junta, composed of 31 unsalaried elected members, is responsible for such things as the freedom of the citizens, the regulation of cultural activities, the naming of streets and public places, and the placement of monuments; it also responds to proposals of the Intendant in various circumstances. Its seat is the architecturally remarkable Casa de Francisco G\u00f3mez in Ciudad Vieja.A 2016 private ranking named Subnational Legislative Online Opening Index measured the data availability in official websites, scoring Montevideo as the second most open district nationally at 17.50 points.\n\n\n=== Intendants of Montevideo ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn recent years Montevideo nightlife has moved to Parque Rod\u00f3, where a large concentration of buildings cater for the recreational interests of young people during the night time. Under a presidential decree of 1 March 2006 smoking is prohibited in any public place with roofing, and there is a prohibition on the sale of alcohol in certain businesses from 21.00 to 9.00.Montevideo has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Literature since December 2015.\n\n\n=== The arts ===\nMontevideo has a very rich architectural heritage and an impressive number of writers, artists, and musicians. Uruguayan tango is a unique form of dance that originated in the neighbourhoods of Montevideo towards the end of the 1800s. Tango, candombe and murga are the three main styles of music in this city. The city is also the centre of the cinema of Uruguay, which includes commercial, documentary and experimental films. There are two movie theatre companies running seven cinemas, around ten independent ones and four art film cinemas in the city. The theatre of Uruguay is admired inside and outside Uruguayan borders. The Sol\u00eds Theatre is the most prominent theatre in Uruguay and the oldest in South America. There are several notable theatrical companies and thousands of professional actors and amateurs. Montevideo playwrights produce dozens of works each year; of major note are Mauricio Rosencof, Ana Magnabosco and Ricardo Prieto. \n\n\n==== Visual arts ====\n\nThe daily newspaper El Pa\u00eds sponsors the Virtual Museum of contemporary Uruguayan art. The director and curator of the Museum presents exhibitions in \"virtual spaces, supplemented by information, biographies, texts in English and Spanish\".In the early 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo, one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a \"hotbed of resistance\". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nThe first public library in Montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of Father Jos\u00e9 Manuel P\u00e9rez Castellano, who died in 1815. Its promoter, director and organizer was Father D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga, who also made a considerable donation along with donations from Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Guerra, as well as others from the Convent of San Francisco in Salta. In 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes. The current building of the National Library of Uruguay (Biblioteca P\u00fablica de Uruguay) was designed by Luis Crespi in the Neoclassical style and occupies an area of 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). Construction began in 1926 and it was finally inaugurated in 1964. Its current collection amounts to roughly 900,000 volumes.\n\n\n===== Authors =====\n\nThe city has a long and rich literary tradition. Although Uruguayan literature is not limited to the authors of the capital (Horacio Quiroga was born in Salto and Mario Benedetti in Paso de los Toros, for instance), Montevideo has been and is the centre of the editorial and creative activity of literature.\nIn 1900, the city had a remarkable group of writers, including Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Julio Herrera y Reissig, Delmira Agustini and Felisberto Hern\u00e1ndez. Montevideo was then called the \"Atenas del Plata\" or the \"Athens of the Rio de la Plata\".\n\nAmong the outstanding authors of Montevideo of the second half of the 20th century are Juan Carlos Onetti, Antonio Larreta, Eduardo Galeano, Marosa di Giorgio and Cristina Peri Rossi.A new generation of writers have become known internationally in recent years. These include Eduardo Espina (essayist and poet), Fernando Butazzoni (novelist), Rafael Courtoisie (poet) and Hugo Burel (short story writer and novelist).\n\n\n==== Music ====\nIn Montevideo, as throughout the Rio de Plata region, the most popular forms of music are tango, milonga and vals criollo. Many notable songs originated in Montevideo including \"El Tango supremo\", La Cumparsita\", La Milonga\", \"La Pu\u00f1alada\" and \"Desde el Alma\", composed by notable Montevideo musicians such as Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez, Pint\u00edn Castellanos and Rosita Melo. Tango is deeply ingrained in the cultural life of the city and is the theme for many of the bars and restaurants in the city. Fun Fun' Bar, established in 1935, is one of the most important places for tango in Uruguay as is El Farolito, located in the old part of the city and Joventango, Caf\u00e9 Las Musas, Garufa and Vieja Viola. The city is also home to the Montevideo Jazz Festival and has the Bancaria Jazz Club bar catering for jazz enthusiasts.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe center of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto (\"Port Market\"). Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. A torta frita is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the centre for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt. Montevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Recreation ===\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nA Cultural Centre of Spain, as well as Asturian and cultural centres, testify to Montevideo's considerable Spanish heritage. Montevideo also has important museums including Museo Torres Garc\u00eda, Museo Jos\u00e9 Gurvich, Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales and Museo Juan Manuel Blanes etc.\nThe Montevideo Cabildo was the seat of government during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata. It is located in front of Constitution Square, in Ciudad Vieja. Built between 1804 and 1869 in Neoclassical style, with a series of Doric and Ionic columns, it became a National Heritage Site in 1975. In 1958, the Municipal Historic Museum and Archive was inaugurated here. It features three permanent city museum exhibitions, as well as temporary art exhibitions, cultural events, seminars, symposiums and forums.\n\nThe Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo's first theatre (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules-L\u00e9on Chifflot who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site. The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts, ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th\u201318th century from the area of present-day Iran. The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government.\n\nThe National History Museum of Montevideo is located in the historical residence of General Fructuoso Rivera. It exhibits artifacts related to the history of Uruguay. In a process begun in 1998, the National Museum of Natural History (1837) and the National Museum of Anthropology (1981), merged in 2001, becoming the National Museum of Natural History and Anthropology. In July 2009, the two institutions again became independent. The Historical Museum has annexed eight historical houses in the city, five of which are located in the Ciudad Vieja. One of them, on the same block with the main building, is the historic residence of Antonio Montero, which houses the Museo Romantico.\n\nThe Museo Torres Garc\u00eda is located in the Old Town, and exhibits Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda's unusual portraits of historical icons and cubist paintings akin to those of Picasso and Braque. The museum was established by Manolita Pi\u00f1a Torres, the widow of Torres Garcia, after his death in 1949. She also set up the Garc\u00eda Torres Foundation, a private non-profit organization that organizes the paintings, drawings, original writings, archives, objects and furniture designed by the painter as well as the photographs, magazines and publications related to him.\n\nThere are several other important art museums in Montevideo. The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rod\u00f3 has Uruguay's largest collection of paintings. The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930, the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay, significant with regard to the fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes. In back of the museum is a Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp. The Museo de Historia del Arte, located in the Palacio Municipal, features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period. The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial, in the Ciudad Vieja, has preserved collections of the archaeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archaeologist Antonio Taddei. These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America, painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Museo de Arte Contempo has small but impressive exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture.There are also other types of museums in the city. The Museo del Gaucho y de la Moneda, located in the Centro, has distinctive displays of the historical culture of Uruguay's gauchos, their horse gear, silver work and mate (tea), gourds, and bombillas (drinking straws) in odd designs. The Museo Naval, is located on the eastern waterfront in Buceo and offers exhibits depicting the maritime history of Uruguay. The Museo del Autom\u00f3vil, belonging to the Automobile Club of Uruguay, has a rich collection of vintage cars which includes a 1910 Hupmobile. The Museo y Parque Fernando Garc\u00eda in Carrasco, a transport and automobile museum, includes old horse carriages and some early automobiles. The Castillo Pittamiglio, with an unusual fa\u00e7ade, highlights the eccentric legacy of Humberto Pittamiglio, local alchemist and architect.\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\n\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is home to a number of festivals and carnivals including a Gaucho festival when people ride through the streets on horseback in traditional gaucho gear. The major annual festival is the annual Montevideo Carnival which is part of the national festival of Carnival Week, celebrated throughout Uruguay, with central activities in the capital, Montevideo. Officially, the public holiday lasts for two days on Carnival Monday and Shrove Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, but due to the prominence of the festival, most shops and businesses close for the entire week.\nDuring carnival there are many open-air stage performances and competitions and the streets and houses are vibrantly decorated. \"Tablados\" or popular scenes, both fixed and movable, are erected in the whole city. Notable displays include \"Desfile de las Llamadas\" (\"Parade of the Calls\"), which is a grand united parade held on the south part of downtown, where it used to be a common ritual back in the early 20th century. Due to the scale of the festival, preparation begins as early as December with an election of the \"zonal beauty queens\" to appear in the carnival.\n\n\n==== Sports ====\n\nEstadio Centenario, the national football stadium in Parque Batlle, was opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay's first constitution. In this World Cup, Uruguay won the title game against Argentina by 4 goals to 2. The stadium has 70,000 seats. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums, along with Maracan\u00e3, Wembley Stadium, San Siro, Estadio Azteca, and Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. A museum located within the football stadium has exhibits of memorabilia from Uruguay's 1930 and 1950 World Cup championships. Museum tickets give access to the stadium, stands, locker rooms and playing field.Between 1935 and 1938, the athletics track and the municipal velodrome were completed within Parque Batlle. The Tabar\u00e9 Athletic Club is occasionally made over as a carnival theatre using impermanent materials.\n\nToday the vast majority of teams in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n come from Montevideo, including Nacional, Pe\u00f1arol, Central Espa\u00f1ol, Cerrito, Cerro, Danubio, Defensor Sporting, Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9nix, Liverpool, Wanderers, Racing, River Plate, Club Atl\u00e9tico Torque and Rampla Juniors.\nBesides Estadio Centenario, other stadiums include Estadio Campeon del Siglo, Pe\u00f1arol, Gran Parque Central, Belvedere, Complejo Rentistas, Jardines del Hip\u00f3dromo, Jos\u00e9 Pedro Damiani, \"La Bombonera\", Luis Franzini, Luis Tr\u00f3ccoli and the park stadiums of Abraham Paladino, Alfredo V\u00edctor Viera, Omar Saroldi, Jos\u00e9 Nasazzi, Osvaldo Roberto, Maracan\u00e1 and Palermo.\nThe city has a tradition as host of major international basketball tournaments including the official 1967 FIBA World Cup and the 1988 1997 and 2017 editions of the official Americas Basketball Championship.\nThe Uruguayan Basketball League is headquartered in Montevideo and most of its teams are from the city, including Defensor Sporting, Bigu\u00e1, Aguada, Goes, Malv\u00edn, Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tica, and Trouville. Montevideo is also a centre of rugby; equestrianism, which regained importance in Montevideo after the Maro\u00f1as Racecourse reopened; golf, with the Club de Punta Carretas; and yachting, with the Puerto del Buceo, an ideal place to moor yachts. The Golf Club of Punta Carretas was founded in 1894 covers all the area encircled by the west side of Bulevar Artigas, the Rambla (Montevideo's promenade) and the Parque Rod\u00f3 (Fun Fair).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChurch and state are officially separated since 1916 in Uruguay. The religion with most followers in Montevideo is Roman Catholicism and has been so since the foundation of the city. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montevideo was created as the Apostolic Vicariate of Montevideo in 1830. The vicariate was promoted to the Diocese of Montevideo on 13 July 1878. Pope Leo XIII elevated it to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese on 14 April 1897. The new archdiocese became the Metropolitan of the suffragan sees of Canelones, Florida, Maldonado\u2013Punta del Este, Melo, Mercedes, Minas, Salto, San Jos\u00e9 de Mayo, Tacuaremb\u00f3.\nMontevideo is the only archdiocese in Uruguay and, as its Ordinary, the archbishop is also Primate of the Catholic Church in Uruguay. The archdiocese's mother church and thus seat of its archbishop is Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n y San Felipe y Santiago. As of 2010, the current Archbishop of Montevideo is Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet, SDB, since his appointment on 11 February 2014.Other religious faiths in Montevideo are Protestantism, Umbanda, Judaism, and there are many people who define themselves as Atheists and Agnostics, while others profess \"believing in God but without religion\".\n\n\n==== Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral ====\n\nThe Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Roman Catholic church of Montevideo. It is located in Ciudad Vieja, immediately across Constitution Square from the Cabildo. In 1740 a brick church was built on the site. In 1790, the foundation was laid for the current neoclassical structure. The church was consecrated in 1804. Bicentennial celebrations were held in 2004.\nIn 1897, Pope Leo XIII elevated the church to Metropolitan Cathedral status. Important ceremonies are conducted under the direction of the Archbishop of Montevideo. Weddings and choral concerts are held here and the parish priest conducts the routine functions of the cathedral. In the 19th century, its precincts were also used as a burial place of famous people who died in the city. For decades, the prison and the nearby Punta Carretas parish church were the only major buildings in the neighbourhood.\n\n\n==== Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n ====\n\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (\"Our Lady of the Sacred Heart\"), also known as Iglesia Punta Carretas (\"Punta Carretas Church\"), was built between 1917 and 1927 in the Romanesque Revival style. The church was originally part of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, but is presently in the parish of the Ecclesiastic Curia. Its location is at the corner of Solano Garc\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 Ellauri. It has a nave and aisles. The roof has many vaults. During the construction of the Punta Carretas Shopping complex, major cracks developed in the structure of the church as a result of differential foundation settlement.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is the economic and political centre of the country. Most of the largest and wealthiest businesses in Uruguay have their headquarters in the city. Since the 1990s the city has undergone rapid economic development and modernization, including two of Uruguay's most important buildings\u2014the World Trade Center Montevideo (1998), and Telecommunications Tower (2000), the headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company ANTEL, increasing the city's integration into the global marketplace.The Port of Montevideo, in the northern part of Ciudad Vieja, is one of the major ports of South America and plays a very important role in the city's economy. The port has been growing rapidly and consistently at an average annual rate of 14 percent due to an increase in foreign trade. The city has received a US$20 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to modernize the port, increase its size and efficiency, and enable lower maritime and river transportation costs.The most important state-owned companies headquartered in Montevideo are: AFE (railways), ANCAP (Energy), Administracion Nacional de Puertos (Ports), ANTEL (telecommunications), BHU (savings and loan), BROU (bank), BSE (insurance), OSE (water & sewage), UTE (electricity). These companies operate under public law, using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called Ente Autonomo (\"autonomous entity\"). The government also owns part of other companies operating under private law, such as those owned wholly or partially by the CND (National Development Corporation).\nBanking has traditionally been one of the strongest service export sectors in Uruguay: the country was once dubbed \"the Switzerland of America\", mainly for its banking sector and stability, although that stability has been threatened in the 21st century by the recent global economic climate. The largest bank in Uruguay is Banco Republica (BROU), based in Montevideo. Almost 20 private banks, most of them branches of international banks, operate in the country (Banco Santander, BBVA, ABN AMRO, Citibank, among others). There are also a myriad of brokers and financial-services bureaus, among them Ficus Capital, Galfin Sociedad de Bolsa, Europa Sociedad de Bolsa, Dar\u00edo Cukier, GBU, Horde\u00f1ana & Asociados Sociedad de Bolsa, etc.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism accounts for much of Uruguay's economy. Tourism in Montevideo is centered in the Ciudad Vieja area, which includes the city's oldest buildings, several museums, art galleries, and nightclubs, with Sarand\u00ed Street and the Mercado del Puerto being the most frequented venues of the old city. On the edge of Ciudad Vieja, Plaza Independencia is surrounded by many sights, including the Sol\u00eds Theatre and the Palacio Salvo; the plaza also constitutes one end of 18 de Julio Avenue, the city's most important tourist destination outside of Ciudad Vieja. Apart from being a shopping street, the avenue is noted for its Art Deco buildings, three important public squares, the Gaucho Museum, the Palacio Municipal and many other sights. The avenue leads to the Obelisk of Montevideo; beyond that is Parque Batlle, which along with the Parque Prado is another important tourist destination. Along the coast, the Fortaleza del Cerro, the Rambla (the coastal avenue), 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) of sandy beaches, and Punta Gorda attract many tourists, as do the Barrio Sur and Palermo barrios.The Ministry of Tourism offers a two-and-a-half-hour city tour and the Montevideo Tourist Guide Association offers guided tours in English, Italian, Portuguese and German. Apart from these, many private companies offer organized city tours.\nMost tourists to the city come from Argentina, Brazil and Europe, with the number of visitors from elsewhere in Latin America and from the United States growing every year, thanks to an increasing number of international airline arrivals at Carrasco International Airport as well as cruises that arrive into the port of Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\nMontevideo has over 50 hotels, mostly located in the city centre or along the beachfront of the Rambla de Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nMontevideo is the heartland of retailing in Uruguay. The city has become the principal centre of business and real estate, including many expensive buildings and modern towers for residences and offices, surrounded by extensive green spaces. In 1985, the first shopping centre in Rio de la Plata, Montevideo Shopping was built. In 1994, with building of three more shopping complexes such as the Shopping Tres Cruces, Portones Shopping, and Punta Carretas Shopping, the business map of the city changed dramatically. The creation of shopping complexes brought a major change in the habits of the people of Montevideo. Global firms such as McDonald's and Burger King etc. are firmly established in Montevideo.\nApart from the big shopping complexes, the main retailing venues of the city are: most of 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro and Cord\u00f3n barrios, a length of Agraciada Avenue in the Paso de Molino area of Belvedere, a length of Arenal Grande St. and the\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nOut of the 100 radio stations found in Uruguay, 40 of them are in Montevideo. The city has a vibrant artistic and literary community. The press enjoyed full freedom until the advent of the Civic-military dictatorship (1973\u20131985); this freedom returned on 1 March 1985, as part of the restoration of democracy.\nSome of the important newspapers published in the city are: Brecha, La Republica, El Observador, El Pa\u00eds, Gaceta Comercial and La Diaria. El D\u00eda was the most prestigious paper in Uruguay, founded in 1886 by Jos\u00e9 Batlle, who would later go on to become President of Uruguay. The paper ceased production in the early 1990s. All television stations have their headquarters in Montevideo, for example: Saeta Channel 10, Teledoce, Channel 4 and National Television (Channel 5)\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte (DNT), part of the national Ministry of Transport and Public Works, is responsible for the organization and development of Montevideo's transport infrastructure. A bus service network covers the entire city. An international bus station, the Tres Cruces Bus Station, is located on the lower level of the Tres Cruces Shopping Center, on the side of Artigas Boulevard. This terminal, along with the Baltazar Brum Bus Terminal (or Rio Branco Terminal) by the Port of Montevideo, handles the long distance and intercity bus routes connecting to destinations within Uruguay.\n\nThe State Railways Administration of Uruguay (AFE) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the Empalme Olmos, San Jose and Florida. These lines operate to major suburban areas of Canelones, San Jos\u00e9 and Florida. Within the Montevideo city limits, local trains stop at Lorenzo Carnelli, Yatai (Step Mill), Sayago, Columbus (line to San Jose and Florida), Pe\u00f1arol and Manga (line Empalme Olmos) stations. The historic 19th century General Artigas Central Station located in the neighbourhood of Aguada, six blocks from the central business district, was abandoned 1 March 2003 and remains closed. A new station, 500 metres (1,600 ft) north of the old one and part of the Tower of Communications modern complex, has taken over the rail traffic.Carrasco International Airport (IATA: MVD, ICAO: SUMU), which serves Montevideo, is located 19 km (12 mi) from the city centre. Several international airlines operate there. The airport serves over 1,500,000 passengers annually. \u00c1ngel S. Adami Airport is a private airport operated by minor charter companies.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Montevideo, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 65 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 18% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.2 km, while 6% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nThe port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbour entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of R\u00edo de la Plata, Buenos Aires.\nThe main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, until the 21st century, physical changes had ceased, and since that time the area had degraded due to national economic stagnation.The port's proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.Every year more than one hundred cruises arrive, bringing tourists to Montevideo by public or private tours.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Public education ===\nThe University of the Republic is the country's largest and most important university, with a student body of 81,774, according to the census of 2007. It was founded on 18 July 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its current Rector is Dr. Rodrigo Arocena. The university houses 14 faculties (departments) and various institutes and schools. Many eminent Uruguayans have graduated from this university, including Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Jos\u00e9 Luis Massera, Gabriel Paternain, Mario Wschebor, Roman Fresnedo Siri, Carlos Ott and Eladio Dieste\nThe process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time.\n\n\n=== Private education ===\nThe largest private university in Uruguay, is also located in Montevideo. ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942, and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996, becoming the second private educational institution in the country to achieve that status. It is a member of World ORT, an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nThe university has about 8,000 students, distributed among 5 faculties and institutes, mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering. Its current rector as of 2010 is Dr. Jorge A. Gr\u00fcnberg.\nThe Montevideo Crandon Institute is an American School of missionary origin and the main Methodist educational institution in Uruguay. Founded in 1879 and supported by the Women's Society of the Methodist Church of the United States, it is one of the most traditional and emblematic institutions in the city inculcating John Wesley's values. Its alumni include presidents, senators, ambassadors and Nobel Prize winners, along with musicians, scientists, and others. The Montevideo Crandon Institute boasts of being the first academic institution in South America where a home economics course was taught.\n\nThe Christian Brothers of Ireland Stella Maris College is a private, co-educational, not-for-profit Catholic school located in the wealthy residential southeastern neighbourhood of Carrasco. Established in 1955, it is regarded as one of the best high schools in the country, blending a rigorous curriculum with strong extracurricular activities. The school's headmaster, history professor Juan Pedro Toni, is a member of the Stella Maris Board of Governors and the school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Its long list of distinguished former pupils includes economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school's alumni club.\nAlso in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo, one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, founded in 1908 with \"the object of giving children a complete education, both intellectual and moral, based upon the ideas and principles of the best schools in The British Isles\".\nThe School is governed by the Board of Governors, elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay, whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay. Prominent alumni include former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry Herr\u00e1n and Gabriel Gurm\u00e9ndez Armand-Ugon.\nLocated in Cordon, St.Brendan's school, previously named St.Catherine's is a non-profit civil association, which has a solid institutional culture with a clear vision of the future. It is knowned for being one of the best schools in the country, joining students from the wealthiest parts of Montevideo, such us, Punta Carretas, Pocitos, Malvin and Carrasco.\nSt. Brendan's School is a bilingual, non-denominational school that promotes a pedagogical constructivist approach focused on the child as a whole. In this approach, understanding is built from the connections children make between their own prior knowledge and the learning experiences, thus developing critical thinking skills. It is also the only school in the country implementing the three International Baccalaureate Programmes. These are:\n\nDiploma Programme \u2013 Pre-University course for students aged 16 to 19. The Diploma Programme is a two-year curriculum.\nMYP -Middle Years Programme. For students aged 12 to 16.\nPYP \u2013 Primary Years Programme. For students aged 3 to 12.Other educational institutions of note include Colegio Ingles, Instituto Preuniversitario Salesiano Juan XXIII, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Montevideo, Ivy Thomas, German School of Montevideo and Colegio Preuniversitario Ciudad de San Felipe.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nIn Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by polyclinics and hospitals or sanatorios. The term hospital is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while sanatorio is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.\n\n\n=== Public hospitals ===\nHospital de Cl\u00ednicas \"Dr. Manuel Quintela\" is a University Hospital attached to the University of the Republic, and is located on Avenida Italia. It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928\u20131929 and has a surface area of 110,000 square metres (1,200,000 sq ft) on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr. Hugo Villar, who was a considerable influence on the institution.\nHospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaran\u00ed and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of Jos\u00e9 Toribio (son of Tom\u00e1s Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaran\u00ed street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaran\u00ed and 25 de Mayo) and Juli\u00e1n Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Est\u00e9vez in 1798.Hospital Pereira Rossell was founded in 1908 and was built on land donated in late 1900 by Alexis Rossell y Rius and Dolores Pereira de Rossell. It was the city's first pediatric hospital, and shortly afterwards the addition of an obstetric and gynaecological clinic in 1915 made it the first maternity hospital as well. Later, the hospital received a donation from Dr. Enrique Pouey for a radiotherapy unit.\nHospital Vilardeb\u00f3 is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist Teodoro Vilardeb\u00f3 Matuliche, it opened 21 May 1880. The hospital was originally one of the best of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel. It has an emergency service, outpatient, clinic and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others. The average patient age is 30 years; more than half of the patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.\nOther public polyclinics and hospitals of note include the Hospital Saint Bois, founded 18 November 1928, which consists of a General Hospital and Eye Hospital; the Pasteur Hospital in La Uni\u00f3n neighbourhood; the Hospital Espa\u00f1ol, which was founded in 1886, passed to the private sector in the 20th century, closed in 2004 and was restored and reinaugurated in 2007 as the municipal Juan Jose Crottogini Polyclinic; the National Cancer Institute; and the National Institute of Trauma and Orthopedics.\n\n\n=== Private healthcare ===\nPrivate healthcare is offered by many private health insurance companies, each of which has one or more polyclinics and owns or is associated with one or more hospitals. Private medical facilities of note include the Hospital Brit\u00e1nico, the Italian Hospital of Montevideo, Mutualista CASMU's Sanatoria I, II, III and IV, the Evangelical Hospital, M\u00e9dica Uruguaya, Sanatorio de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, Sanatorios del C\u00edrculo Cat\u00f3lico, Sanatorio Casa de Galicia and Sanatorio GREMCA.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nMontevideo is twinned with:\n\nMontevideo is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities since 12 October 1982.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nAlbes, Edward.

        "wiki": "Montevideo (Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u03b2i\u02c8\u00f0eo]) is the capital and largest city of Uruguay. According to the 2011 census, the city proper has a population of 1,319,108 (about one-third of the country's total population) in an area of 201 square kilometres (78 sq mi). The southernmost capital city in the Americas, Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the R\u00edo de la Plata.\nThe city was established in 1724 by a Spanish soldier, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, as a strategic move amidst the Spanish-Portuguese dispute over the platine region. It was also under brief British rule in 1807. Montevideo is the seat of the administrative headquarters of Mercosur and ALADI, Latin America's leading trade blocs, a position that entailed comparisons to the role of Brussels in Europe.The 2019 Mercer's report on quality of life, rated Montevideo first in Latin America, a rank the city has consistently held since 2005. As of 2010, Montevideo was the 19th largest city economy in the continent and 9th highest income earner among major cities. In 2020, it has a projected GDP of $49.7 billion, with a per capita of $28,385.In 2018, it was classified as a beta global city ranking eighth in Latin America and 84th in the world. Montevideo hosted every match during the first FIFA World Cup, in 1930. Described as a \"vibrant, eclectic place with a rich cultural life\", and \"a thriving tech center and entrepreneurial culture\", Montevideo ranked eighth in Latin America on the 2013 MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.In 2014, it was also regarded as the fifth most gay-friendly metropolis in the world and the first in Latin America. It is the hub of commerce and higher education in Uruguay as well as its chief port. The city is also the financial hub of Uruguay and the cultural anchor of a metropolitan area with a population of around 2 million.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are several explanations about the word Montevideo. All agree that \"Monte\" refers to the Cerro de Montevideo, the hill situated across the Bay of Montevideo, but there is disagreement about the etymological origin of the \"video\" part.\n\nMonte vide eu (\"I saw a mount\") is the most widespread belief but is rejected by the majority of experts, who consider it unlikely because it involves a mix of dialects. The name would come from a Portuguese expression which means \"I saw a mount\", wrongly pronounced by an anonymous sailor belonging to the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes on catching sight of the Cerro de Montevideo.\nMonte Vidi: This hypothesis comes from the \"Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n\" (Navigational Calendar) of boatswain Francisco de Albo, member of the expedition of Fernando de Magallanes, who wrote, \"Tuesday of the said [month of January 1520] we were on the straits of Cape Santa Mar\u00eda [now Punta del Este], from where the coast runs east to west, and the terrain is sandy, and at the right of the cape there is a mountain like a hat to which we gave the name \"Montevidi\".\" This is the oldest Spanish document that mentions the promontory with a name similar to the one that designates the city, but it does not contain any mention of the alleged cry \"Monte vide eu.\"\nMonte-VI-D-E-O (Monte VI De Este a Oeste): According to Rolando Laguarda Tr\u00edas, professor of history, the Spaniards annotated the geographic location on a map or Portolan chart, so that the mount/hill is the VI (6th) mount observable on the coast, navigating R\u00edo de la Plata from east to west. With the passing of time, these words were unified to \"Montevideo\". No conclusive evidence has been found to confirm this academic hypothesis nor can it be asserted with certainty which were the other five mounts observable before the Cerro.\nMonte Ovidio (Monte Santo Ovidio), a less widespread hypothesis of a religious origin, stems from an interpolation in the aforementioned Diario de Navegaci\u00f3n of Fernando de Albo, where it is asserted \"corruptly now called Santo Vidio\" when they refer to the hat-like mount which they named Monte Vidi (that is, the Cerro de Montevideo). Ovidio (Saint Ovidius) was the third bishop of the Portuguese city of Braga, where he was always revered; a monument to him was erected there in 1505. Given the relationship that the Portuguese had with the discovery and foundation of Montevideo, and despite the fact that this hypothesis, like the previous ones, lacks conclusive documentation, there have been those who linked the name of Santo Ovidio or Vidio (appearing on some maps of the time) with the subsequent derivation of the name \"Montevideo\" given to the region since the early years of the 16th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBetween 1680 and 1683, Portugal founded the city of Colonia do Sacramento in the region across the bay from Buenos Aires. This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca of Portugal built the Montevieu fort.\nA Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were known as Guanches or Canarians. There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name of Jorge Burgues.A census of the city's inhabitants was performed in 1724 and then a plan was drawn delineating the city and designating it as San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo, later shortened to Montevideo. The census counted fifty families of Galician and Canary Islands origin, more than 1000 indigenous people, mostly Guaran\u00ed, as well as Black African slaves of Bantu origin.A few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the R\u00edo de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River, competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata brought it in confrontations with the city of Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was taken over to be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.\nIn 1776, Spain made Montevideo its main naval base (Real Apostadero de Marina) for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, Fernando Po, and the Falklands.Until the end of the 18th century, Montevideo remained a fortified area, today known as Ciudad Vieja.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nOn 3 February 1807, British troops under the command of General Samuel Auchmuty and Admiral Charles Stirling occupied the city during the Battle of Montevideo (1807), but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the same year on 2 September when John Whitelocke was forced to surrender to troops formed by forces of the Banda Oriental\u2014roughly the same area as modern Uruguay\u2014and of Buenos Aires. After this conflict, the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de El\u00edo opposed the new viceroy Santiago de Liniers, and created a government Junta when the Peninsular War started in Spain, in defiance of Liniers. El\u00edo disestablished the Junta when Liniers was replaced by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros.\nDuring the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo. During that year and the next, Uruguayan revolutionary Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain. In 1811, the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo, which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution. The siege was lifted at the end of that year, when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region.The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814. In 1816, Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821, it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil. It was named Imperial City by Emperor Pedro I when the city was part of the Empire of Brazil as capital of the Cisplatina province. Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the Treinta y Tres Orientales (\"Thirty-Three Orientals\") re-established the independence of the region in 1825. Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828, with Montevideo as the nation's capital. In 1829, the demolition of the city's fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja, referred to as the \"Ciudad Nueva\" (\"new city\"). Urban expansion, however, moved very slowly because of the events that followed.\n\nUruguay's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between Manuel Oribe and Fructuoso Rivera, the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the Empire of Brazil under the command of Lavalleja, each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction. Politics were divided between Oribe's Blancos (\"whites\"), represented by the National Party, and Rivera's Colorados (\"reds\"), represented by the Colorado Party, with each party's name taken from the colour of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the Guerra Grande, which lasted until 1851.\nThe city of Montevideo suffered a siege of eight years between 1843 and 1851, during which it was supplied by sea with British and French support. Oribe, with the support of the then conservative Governor of Buenos Aires Province Juan Manuel de Rosas, besieged the Colorados in Montevideo, where the latter were supported by the French Legion, the Italian Legion, the Basque Legion and battalions from Brazil. Finally, in 1851, with the additional support of Argentine rebels who opposed Rosas, the Colorados defeated Oribe. The fighting, however, resumed in 1855, when the Blancos came to power, which they maintained until 1865. Thereafter, the Colorado Party regained power, which they retained until past the middle of the 20th century.\nAfter the end of hostilities, a period of growth and expansion started for the city. In 1853 a stagecoach bus line was established joining Montevideo with the newly formed settlement of Uni\u00f3n and the first natural gas street lights were inaugurated. From 1854 to 1861 the first public sanitation facilities were constructed. In 1856 the Teatro Sol\u00eds was inaugurated, 15 years after the beginning of its construction. By Decree, in December 1861 the areas of Aguada and Cord\u00f3n were incorporated to the growing Ciudad Nueva (New City). In 1866, an underwater telegraph line connected the city with Buenos Aires. The statue of Peace, La Paz, was erected on a column in Plaza Cagancha and the building of the Postal Service as well as the bridge of Paso Molino were inaugurated in 1867.In 1868, the horse-drawn tram company Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tranv\u00edas al Paso del Molino y Cerro created the first lines connecting Montevideo with Uni\u00f3n, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro, at the time called Cosmopolis. In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras. During the same year and the next, the neighbourhoods Col\u00f3n, Nuevo Par\u00eds and La Comercial were founded. The Sunday market of Trist\u00e1n Narvaja Street was established in Cord\u00f3n in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, Bulevar Circunvalaci\u00f3n was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas, going up to the north end of the city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed to Artigas Boulevard (its current name) in 1885. By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area Los Pocitos was incorporated to the Nov\u00edsima Ciudad (Most New City).The first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas operated ones in 1886. The Hip\u00f3dromo de Maro\u00f1as started operating in 1888, and the neighbourhoods of Reus del Sur, Reus del Norte and Conciliaci\u00f3n were inaugurated in 1889. The new building of the School of Arts and Trades, as well as Zabala Square in Ciudad Vieja were inaugurated in 1890, followed by the Italian Hospital in 1891. In the same year, the village of Pe\u00f1arol was founded. Other neighbourhoods that were founded were Belgrano and Belvedere in 1892, Jacinto Vera in 1895 and Trouville in 1897. In 1894 the new port was constructed, and in 1897, the Central Railway Station of Montevideo was inaugurated.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, many Europeans (particularly Spaniards and Italians but also thousands from Central Europe) immigrated to the city. In 1908, 30% of the city's population of 300,000 was foreign-born. In that decade the city expanded quickly: new neighbourhoods were created and many separate settlements were annexed to the city, among which were the Villa del Cerro, Pocitos, the Prado and Villa Col\u00f3n. The Rod\u00f3 Park and the Estadio Gran Parque Central were also established, which served as poles of urban development.During the early 20th century, Uruguay saw huge social changes with repercussions primarily in urban areas. Among these changes were the right of divorce (1907) and women's right to vote.The 1910s saw the construction of Montevideo's Rambla; strikes by tram workers, bakers and port workers; the inauguration of electric trams; the creation of the Municipal Intendencias; and the inauguration of the new port.In 1913, the city limits were extended around the entire gulf. The previously independent localities of the Villa del Cerro and La Teja were annexed to Montevideo, becoming two of its neighborhoods.During the 1920s, the equestrian statue of Artigas was installed in Plaza Independencia; the Palacio Legislativo was built; the Spanish Plus Ultra flying boat arrived (the first airplane to fly from Spain to Latin America, 1926); prominent politician and former president Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez died (1929); and ground was broken (1929) for the Estadio Centenario (completed 1930).During World War II, a famous incident involving the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee took place in Punta del Este, 200 kilometers (120 mi) from Montevideo. After the Battle of the River Plate with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy on 13 December 1939, the Graf Spee retreated to Montevideo's port, which was considered neutral at the time. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on 17 December. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. The eagle figurehead of the Graf Spee was salvaged on 10 February 2006; to protect the feelings of those still sensitive to Nazi Germany, the swastika on the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water.\n\nUruguay began to stagnate economically in the mid-1950s; Montevideo began a decline, later exacerbated by widespread social and political violence beginning in 1968 (including the emergence of the guerrilla Movimiento de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional-Tupamaros) and by the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985). There were major problems with supply; the immigration cycle was reversed.\nFrom the 1960s to the end of the dictatorship in 1985, around one hundred people died or disappeared because of the political violence. From 1974 another hundred Uruguayans disappeared also in Argentina. In 1980, the dictatorship proposed a new constitution. The project was submitted to referendum and rejected in the first polls since 1971, with 58% of the votes against and 42% in favour. The result weakened the military and triggered its fall, allowing the return of democracy.In the 1980s, Pope John Paul II visited the city twice. In April 1987, as head of state of Vatican, he signed a mediation agreement for the conflict of the Beagle Channel. He also held a large mass in Tres Cruces, declaring the cross located behind the altar as a monument. In 1988, he returned to the country, visiting Montevideo, Florida, Salto and Melo.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe 2002 Uruguay banking crisis affected several industries of Montevideo. In 2017, the city has maintained 15 years of economic growth, with a GDP of $44 billion, and a GDP per capita of $25,900.Montevideo has consistently been rated as having the highest quality of life of any city in Latin America: by 2015 it held this rank every year during the decade through 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMontevideo is situated on the north shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata, the arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the south coast of Uruguay from the north coast of Argentina; Buenos Aires lies 230 kilometres (140 mi) west on the Argentine side. The Santa Luc\u00eda River forms a natural border between Montevideo and San Jos\u00e9 Department to its west. To the city's north and east is Canelones Department, with the stream of Carrasco forming the eastern natural border. The coastline forming the city's southern border is interspersed with rocky protrusions and sandy beaches. The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbour, the nation's largest and one of the largest in the Southern Cone, and the finest natural port in the region, functioning as a crucial component of the Uruguayan economy and foreign trade. Various streams criss-cross the town and empty into the Bay of Montevideo. Its coastline near the emptying rivers are heavily polluted.The city has an average elevation of 43 metres (141 ft). Its highest elevations are two hills: the Cerro de Montevideo and the Cerro de la Victoria, with the highest point, the peak of Cerro de Montevideo, crowned by a fortress, the Fortaleza del Cerro at a height of 134 m (440 ft). Closest cities by road are Las Piedras to the north and the so-called Ciudad de la Costa (a conglomeration of coastal towns) to the east, both in the range of 20 to 25 km (16 mi) from the city center. The approximate distances to the neighbouring department capitals by road are, 90 km (56 mi) to San Jose de Mayo (San Jose Department) and 46 km (29 mi) to Canelones (Canelones Department).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMontevideo enjoys a humid subtropical climate (Cfa, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). The city has mild winters (June to September), warm-hot summers (December to March) and volatile springs (October and November); there are numerous thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout the year, reaching around 950 millimetres (37 in).Winters are generally cool, wet, windy and overcast. During this season, there are bursts of icy and relatively dry winds of continental polar air masses, giving an unpleasant chilly feeling to the everyday life of the city. Frosts occur few times during winter, generally not falling below 28\u00b0 F (-2\u00b0 C) because of the oceanic influence that moderates the temperature; few miles away from the coast, frosts are more common and colder. Rainfall and sleet are a frequent winter occurrence, but snowfall is extremely rare: flurries have been recorded only four times but with no accumulation, the last one on 13 July 1930 during the inaugural match of the World Cup, (the other three snowfalls were in 1850, 1853 and 1917); the alleged 1980 Carrasco snowfall was actually a hailstorm.Summers are warm-hot and humid, with less wind than other seasons. During this season, a moderate wind often blows from the sea in the evenings which has a pleasant cooling effect on the city, in contrast to the more-severe summer heat of nearby cities like Buenos Aires. Heat waves come with the north winds, which bring humid and hot air masses from the tropical interior of the continent. These warm periods are usually followed by thunderstorms, generated by cold fronts of the southwest that lowers temperatures considerably. This phenomenon is regional, and can occur several times all year long.\nMontevideo has an annual average temperature of 16.7 \u00b0C (62.1 \u00b0F). The lowest recorded temperature is \u22125.6 \u00b0C (21.9 \u00b0F) while the highest is 42.8 \u00b0C (109.0 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions and barrios ===\n\nAs of 2010, the city of Montevideo has been divided into 8 political municipalities (Municipios), referred to with the letters from A to G, including CH, each presided over by a mayor elected by the citizens registered in the constituency. This division, according to the Municipality of Montevideo, \"aims to advance political and administrative decentralization in the department of Montevideo, with the aim of deepening the democratic participation of citizens in governance.\" The head of each Municipio is called an alcalde or (if female) alcaldesa.Of much greater importance is the division of the city into 62 barrios: neighbourhoods or wards. Many of the city's barrios\u2014such as Sayago, Ituzaing\u00f3 and Pocitos\u2014were previously geographically separate settlements, later absorbed by the growth of the city. Others grew up around certain industrial sites, including the salt-curing works of Villa del Cerro and the tanneries in Nuevo Par\u00eds. Each barrio has its own identity, geographic location and socio-cultural activities. A neighbourhood of great significance is Ciudad Vieja, that was surrounded by a protective wall until 1829. This area contains most important buildings of the colonial era and early decades of independence.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n\nThe architecture of Montevideo ranges from Neoclassical buildings such as the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral to the Postmodern style of the World Trade Center Montevideo or the 158-metre (518 ft) ANTEL Telecommunication Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the country. The Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the Palacio Salvo dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building facades in the Old Town reflect the city's extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the Legislative Palace, the City Hall, Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower. The most notable sports stadium is the Estadio Centenario within Parque Batlle. Parque Batlle, Parque Rod\u00f3 and Parque Prado are Montevideo's three great parks.The Pocitos district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the \"Edificio Panamericano\" designed by Raul Sichero, and the \"Positano\" and \"El Pilar\" designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis Garc\u00eda Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighbourhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle class residents.\n\n\n==== Palacio Legislativo ====\n\nThe Palacio Legislativo in Aguada, the north of the city centre, is currently the seat of the Uruguayan Parliament. Construction started in 1904 and was sponsored by the government of President Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. It was designed by Italian architects Vittorio Meano and Gaetano Moretti, who planned the building's interior. Among the notable contributors to the project was sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni, who contributed numerous reliefs and allegorical sculptures.\n\n\n==== World Trade Center Montevideo ====\n\nWorld Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998, but work was completed in 2009. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998. It has 22 floors and 17,100 square metres of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and 27,000 square metres (290,000 sq ft) of space. The 6,300-square-metre (68,000 sq ft) World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a centre of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St. Among the establishments on the plaza are Burger King, Walrus, Bamboo, Asia de Cuba, Gardenia Mvd, and La Claraboya Cafe.\nThe Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social place. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor Pablo Atchugarry. World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and 53,500 square metres (576,000 sq ft) of space is under construction as of 2010.\n\n\n==== Telecommunications Tower ====\n\nTorre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the 158 metres (518 ft), 37-floor headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company, ANTEL, and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect Carlos Ott. It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by American Bridge and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.\nWhen its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40 million, plus US$25 million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65 million price into US$102 million.\n\n\n==== Ciudad Vieja (Old City) ====\n\nCiudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent barrio of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and night-clubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.\n\nMontevideo's most important plaza is Plaza Independencia, located between Ciudad Vieja and downtown Montevideo. It starts with the Gateway of The Citadel at one end and ends at the beginning of 18 de Julio Avenue. It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city. Several notable buildings are located here.  The Sol\u00eds Theatre is Uruguay's oldest theatre. It was built in 1856 and is currently owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theatre, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by Philippe Starck. The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theatre reopened in August of that year. The plaza is also the site of the offices of the President of Uruguay (both the Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower). The Artigas Mausoleum is located at the centre of the plaza. Statues include that of Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, hero of Uruguay's independence movement; an honour guard keeps vigil at the Mausoleum.Palacio Salvo, at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands 100 metres (330 ft) high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confiter\u00eda La Giralda, renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez wrote his tango \"La Cumparsita\" (1917.) Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.Also of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (or Plaza Matriz). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the Cabildo\u2014the seat of colonial government\u2014and the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral. The cathedral is the burial place of Fructuoso Rivera, Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Venancio Flores. Another notable square is Plaza Zabala with the equestrian statue of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On its south side, Palacio Taranco, once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto, another major tourist destination.\n\n\n==== Parque Batlle ====\n\nParque Batlle (formerly: Parque de los Aliados, translation: \"Park of the Allies\") is a major public central park, located south of Avenida Italia and north of Avenue Rivera. Along with Parque Prado and Parque Rod\u00f3 it is one of three large parks that dominate Montevideo. The park and surrounding area constitute one of the 62 neighbourhoods (barrios) of the city. The barrio of Parque Batlle is one of seven coastal barrios, the others being Buceo, Carrasco, Malvin, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, and Punta Gorda. The current barrio of Parque Battle includes four former districts: Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and Batlle Park itself and borders the neighbourhoods of La Blanqueada, Tres Cruces, Pocitos and Buceo. It has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income. Villa Dolores, a subdistrict of Parque Batlle, took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Do\u00f1a Dolores Pereira de Rossel. On their grounds, they started a private collection of animals that became a zoological garden and was passed to the city in 1919; in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises.\n\nParque Batlle is named in honour of Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915. The park was originally proposed by an Act of March 1907, which also projected wide boulevards and avenues. French landscape architect, Carlos Thays, began the plantings in 1911. In 1918, the park was named Parque de los Aliados, following the victory of the Allies of World War I. On 5 May 1930, after significant expansion, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, in memory of the prominent politician and president, who had died in 1929. The park was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975. As of 2010, the park covers an area of 60 hectares (150 acres) and is considered the \"lung\" of the Montevideo city due to the large variety of trees planted here.The Estadio Centenario, the national football stadium, opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, and later hosted several other sporting grounds of note (see Sports).\nIn 1934, sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni's \"La Carreta\", a bronze monument on granite base, was installed on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario. One of several statues in the park, it depicts yoked oxen pulling a loaded wagon. It was designated a national monument in 1976. Another statue on the same side of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron.\nOn the west side of Parque Batlle, on Artigas Boulevard, the 1938 Obelisk of Montevideo is a monument dedicated to those who created the first Constitution. The work of sculptor Jos\u00e9 Luis Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn (1891\u20131975), it is a three-sided granite obelisk, 40 metres (130 ft) tall, with bronze statues on its three sides, representing \"Law\", \"Liberty\", and \"Force\", respectively. It has been a National Heritage Site since 1976.\n\n\n==== Parque Prado ====\n\nEstablished in 1873, the largest of Montevideo's six main public parks is the 1.06-square-kilometre (260-acre) Parque Prado. Located in the northern part of the city, the Miguelete Creek flows through the park and the neighbourhood and of the same name. It is surrounded by the avenues Agraciada, Obes Lucas, Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez, Luis Alberto de Herrera and by the streets Castro and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyes.\nThe most frequented areas of the park are the Rosedal, a public rose garden with pergolas, the Botanical Garden, the area around the Hotel del Prado, as well as the Rural del Prado, a seasonal cattle and farm animal fairground. The Rosedal contains four pergolas, eight domes, and a fountain; its 12,000 roses were imported from France in 1910. There are several jogging paths along the Miguelete river.\nThe Presidential Residence is located behind the Botanical Gardens. Established in 1930, Juan Manuel Blanes Museum is situated in the Palladian villa, a National Heritage Site since 1975, and includes a Japanese garden. The Professor Atilio Lombardo Museum and Botanical Gardens were established in 1902. The National Institute of Physical Climatology and its observatory are also in the Prado.\n\n\n==== Parque Rod\u00f3 ====\n\nParque Rod\u00f3 is both a barrio (neighbourhood) of Montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighbourhood itself and belongs to Punta Carretas. The name \"Rod\u00f3\" commemorates Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, an important Uruguayan writer whose monument is in the southern side of the main park. The park was conceived as a French-style city park. Apart from the main park area which is delimited by Sarmiento Avenue to the south, Parque Rod\u00f3 includes an amusement park; the Estadio Luis Franzini, belonging to Defensor Sporting; the front lawn of the Faculty of Engineering and a strip west of the Club de Golf de Punta Carretas that includes the Canteras (\"quarry\") del Parque Rod\u00f3, the Teatro de Verano (\"summer theatre\") and the Lago (\"lake\") del Parque Rod\u00f3.On the east side of the main park area is the National Museum of Visual Arts. On this side, a street market takes place every Sunday. On the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children. An area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography. West of the park, across the coastal avenue Rambla Presidente Wilson, stretches Ramirez Beach. Directly west of the main park are, and belonging to Parque Rod\u00f3 barrio, is the former Parque Hotel, now called Edif\u00edcio Mercosur, seat of the parliament of the members countries of the Mercosur. During the guerilla war the Tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area, including the old hotel.\n\n\n==== Forts ====\nThe first set of subsidiary forts were planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at Colonia del Sacramento. However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship Nossa Senhora de Oliveara. They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.\n\n\n===== Fortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro) =====\n\nFortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839. It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931 and has housed a military museum since 1916. Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.\n\n\n==== Punta Brava Lighthouse ====\n\nPunta Brava Lighthouse (Faro Punta Brava), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876. The lighthouse is 21 metres (69 ft) high and its light reaches 24 km (15 mi) away, with a flash every ten seconds. In 1962, the lighthouse became electric. The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Ingl\u00e9s Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Luc\u00eda River.\n\n\n==== Rambla of Montevideo ====\n\nThe Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word rambla is \"avenue\" or \"watercourse\", but in the Americas it is mostly used as \"coastal avenue\", and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the R\u00edo de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas (\"United Nations\"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.\n\nThe Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even\u2014in a special area\u2014skateboard. Its 27-kilometre (17 mi) length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.Montevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city. Its best known beaches are Ram\u00edrez, Pocitos, Carrasco, Buceo and Malv\u00edn. Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.\n\n\n==== Cemeteries ====\n\nThere are five large cemeteries in Montevideo, all administered by the \"F\u00fanebre y Necr\u00f3polis\" annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Juan Manuel Blanes, Fran\u00e7ois Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont (Isidore Ducasse), Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, and Juan Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn.\nThe other large cemeteries are the Cementerio del Buceo, Cementerio del Cerro, and Cementerio Paso Molino.\nThe British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Brit\u00e1nico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighborhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Mr. Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors, contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine, Henry de Costa, is buried here.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nIn 1860, Montevideo had 57,913 inhabitants including a number of people of African origin who had been brought as slaves and had gained their freedom around the middle of the century. By 1880, the population had quadrupled, mainly because of the great European immigration. In 1908, its population had grown massively to 309,331 inhabitants. In the course of the 20th century the city continued to receive large numbers of European immigrants, especially Spanish and Italian, followed by French, Germans, English, Irish, Swiss, Austrians, Poles, Dutch, Greek, Hungarians, Russians, Croats, Lebanese, Armenians, and Jews of various origins. The last wave of immigrants occurred between 1945 and 1955.According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay's total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of \u22121.5 per thousand. Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975\u20131985, which showed a rate of \u22125.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004. However, mortality continued to fall with life expectancy at birth for both sexes increasing by 1.73 years.In the census of 2011, Montevideo had a population of 1,319,108.\nSource: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica de Uruguay\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Intendencia de Montevideo ===\n\nThe Municipality of Montevideo was first created by a legal act of 18 December 1908. The municipality's first mayor (1909\u20131911) was Daniel Mu\u00f1oz. Municipalities were abolished by the Uruguayan Constitution of 1918, effectively restored during the 1933 military coup of Gabriel Terra, and formally restored by the 1934 Constitution. The 1952 Constitution again decided to abolish the municipalities; it came into effect in February 1955. Municipalities were replaced by departmental councils, which consisted of a collegiate executive board with 7 members from Montevideo and 5 from the interior region. However, municipalities were revived under the 1967 Constitution and have operated continuously since that time.\nSince 1990, Montevideo has been partially decentralized into 18 areas; administration and services for each area is provided by its Zonal Community Center (Centro Comunal Zonal, CCZ), which is subordinate to the Municipality of Montevideo. The boundaries of the municipal districts of Montevideo were created on 12 July 1993, and successively amended on 19 October 1993, 6 June 1994 and 10 November 1994.\nThe city government of Montevideo performs several functions, including maintaining communications with the public, promoting culture, organizing society, caring for the environment and regulating traffic. Its headquarters is the Palacio Municipal on 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro area of Montevideo.Another body, the Junta Departamental, or the Congress of Montevideo, governs the Department of Montevideo. The Junta, composed of 31 unsalaried elected members, is responsible for such things as the freedom of the citizens, the regulation of cultural activities, the naming of streets and public places, and the placement of monuments; it also responds to proposals of the Intendant in various circumstances. Its seat is the architecturally remarkable Casa de Francisco G\u00f3mez in Ciudad Vieja.A 2016 private ranking named Subnational Legislative Online Opening Index measured the data availability in official websites, scoring Montevideo as the second most open district nationally at 17.50 points.\n\n\n=== Intendants of Montevideo ===\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn recent years Montevideo nightlife has moved to Parque Rod\u00f3, where a large concentration of buildings cater for the recreational interests of young people during the night time. Under a presidential decree of 1 March 2006 smoking is prohibited in any public place with roofing, and there is a prohibition on the sale of alcohol in certain businesses from 21.00 to 9.00.Montevideo has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Literature since December 2015.\n\n\n=== The arts ===\nMontevideo has a very rich architectural heritage and an impressive number of writers, artists, and musicians. Uruguayan tango is a unique form of dance that originated in the neighbourhoods of Montevideo towards the end of the 1800s. Tango, candombe and murga are the three main styles of music in this city. The city is also the centre of the cinema of Uruguay, which includes commercial, documentary and experimental films. There are two movie theatre companies running seven cinemas, around ten independent ones and four art film cinemas in the city. The theatre of Uruguay is admired inside and outside Uruguayan borders. The Sol\u00eds Theatre is the most prominent theatre in Uruguay and the oldest in South America. There are several notable theatrical companies and thousands of professional actors and amateurs. Montevideo playwrights produce dozens of works each year; of major note are Mauricio Rosencof, Ana Magnabosco and Ricardo Prieto. \n\n\n==== Visual arts ====\n\nThe daily newspaper El Pa\u00eds sponsors the Virtual Museum of contemporary Uruguayan art. The director and curator of the Museum presents exhibitions in \"virtual spaces, supplemented by information, biographies, texts in English and Spanish\".In the early 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo, one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a \"hotbed of resistance\". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.\n\n\n==== Literature ====\nThe first public library in Montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of Father Jos\u00e9 Manuel P\u00e9rez Castellano, who died in 1815. Its promoter, director and organizer was Father D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga, who also made a considerable donation along with donations from Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Guerra, as well as others from the Convent of San Francisco in Salta. In 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes. The current building of the National Library of Uruguay (Biblioteca P\u00fablica de Uruguay) was designed by Luis Crespi in the Neoclassical style and occupies an area of 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). Construction began in 1926 and it was finally inaugurated in 1964. Its current collection amounts to roughly 900,000 volumes.\n\n\n===== Authors =====\n\nThe city has a long and rich literary tradition. Although Uruguayan literature is not limited to the authors of the capital (Horacio Quiroga was born in Salto and Mario Benedetti in Paso de los Toros, for instance), Montevideo has been and is the centre of the editorial and creative activity of literature.\nIn 1900, the city had a remarkable group of writers, including Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Julio Herrera y Reissig, Delmira Agustini and Felisberto Hern\u00e1ndez. Montevideo was then called the \"Atenas del Plata\" or the \"Athens of the Rio de la Plata\".\n\nAmong the outstanding authors of Montevideo of the second half of the 20th century are Juan Carlos Onetti, Antonio Larreta, Eduardo Galeano, Marosa di Giorgio and Cristina Peri Rossi.A new generation of writers have become known internationally in recent years. These include Eduardo Espina (essayist and poet), Fernando Butazzoni (novelist), Rafael Courtoisie (poet) and Hugo Burel (short story writer and novelist).\n\n\n==== Music ====\nIn Montevideo, as throughout the Rio de Plata region, the most popular forms of music are tango, milonga and vals criollo. Many notable songs originated in Montevideo including \"El Tango supremo\", La Cumparsita\", La Milonga\", \"La Pu\u00f1alada\" and \"Desde el Alma\", composed by notable Montevideo musicians such as Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez, Pint\u00edn Castellanos and Rosita Melo. Tango is deeply ingrained in the cultural life of the city and is the theme for many of the bars and restaurants in the city. Fun Fun' Bar, established in 1935, is one of the most important places for tango in Uruguay as is El Farolito, located in the old part of the city and Joventango, Caf\u00e9 Las Musas, Garufa and Vieja Viola. The city is also home to the Montevideo Jazz Festival and has the Bancaria Jazz Club bar catering for jazz enthusiasts.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe center of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto (\"Port Market\"). Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. A torta frita is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the centre for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt. Montevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\n\n=== Recreation ===\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nA Cultural Centre of Spain, as well as Asturian and cultural centres, testify to Montevideo's considerable Spanish heritage. Montevideo also has important museums including Museo Torres Garc\u00eda, Museo Jos\u00e9 Gurvich, Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales and Museo Juan Manuel Blanes etc.\nThe Montevideo Cabildo was the seat of government during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata. It is located in front of Constitution Square, in Ciudad Vieja. Built between 1804 and 1869 in Neoclassical style, with a series of Doric and Ionic columns, it became a National Heritage Site in 1975. In 1958, the Municipal Historic Museum and Archive was inaugurated here. It features three permanent city museum exhibitions, as well as temporary art exhibitions, cultural events, seminars, symposiums and forums.\n\nThe Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo's first theatre (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules-L\u00e9on Chifflot who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site. The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts, ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th\u201318th century from the area of present-day Iran. The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government.\n\nThe National History Museum of Montevideo is located in the historical residence of General Fructuoso Rivera. It exhibits artifacts related to the history of Uruguay. In a process begun in 1998, the National Museum of Natural History (1837) and the National Museum of Anthropology (1981), merged in 2001, becoming the National Museum of Natural History and Anthropology. In July 2009, the two institutions again became independent. The Historical Museum has annexed eight historical houses in the city, five of which are located in the Ciudad Vieja. One of them, on the same block with the main building, is the historic residence of Antonio Montero, which houses the Museo Romantico.\n\nThe Museo Torres Garc\u00eda is located in the Old Town, and exhibits Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda's unusual portraits of historical icons and cubist paintings akin to those of Picasso and Braque. The museum was established by Manolita Pi\u00f1a Torres, the widow of Torres Garcia, after his death in 1949. She also set up the Garc\u00eda Torres Foundation, a private non-profit organization that organizes the paintings, drawings, original writings, archives, objects and furniture designed by the painter as well as the photographs, magazines and publications related to him.\n\nThere are several other important art museums in Montevideo. The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rod\u00f3 has Uruguay's largest collection of paintings. The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930, the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay, significant with regard to the fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes. In back of the museum is a Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp. The Museo de Historia del Arte, located in the Palacio Municipal, features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period. The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial, in the Ciudad Vieja, has preserved collections of the archaeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archaeologist Antonio Taddei. These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America, painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Museo de Arte Contempo has small but impressive exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture.There are also other types of museums in the city. The Museo del Gaucho y de la Moneda, located in the Centro, has distinctive displays of the historical culture of Uruguay's gauchos, their horse gear, silver work and mate (tea), gourds, and bombillas (drinking straws) in odd designs. The Museo Naval, is located on the eastern waterfront in Buceo and offers exhibits depicting the maritime history of Uruguay. The Museo del Autom\u00f3vil, belonging to the Automobile Club of Uruguay, has a rich collection of vintage cars which includes a 1910 Hupmobile. The Museo y Parque Fernando Garc\u00eda in Carrasco, a transport and automobile museum, includes old horse carriages and some early automobiles. The Castillo Pittamiglio, with an unusual fa\u00e7ade, highlights the eccentric legacy of Humberto Pittamiglio, local alchemist and architect.\n\n\n==== Festivals ====\n\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is home to a number of festivals and carnivals including a Gaucho festival when people ride through the streets on horseback in traditional gaucho gear. The major annual festival is the annual Montevideo Carnival which is part of the national festival of Carnival Week, celebrated throughout Uruguay, with central activities in the capital, Montevideo. Officially, the public holiday lasts for two days on Carnival Monday and Shrove Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, but due to the prominence of the festival, most shops and businesses close for the entire week.\nDuring carnival there are many open-air stage performances and competitions and the streets and houses are vibrantly decorated. \"Tablados\" or popular scenes, both fixed and movable, are erected in the whole city. Notable displays include \"Desfile de las Llamadas\" (\"Parade of the Calls\"), which is a grand united parade held on the south part of downtown, where it used to be a common ritual back in the early 20th century. Due to the scale of the festival, preparation begins as early as December with an election of the \"zonal beauty queens\" to appear in the carnival.\n\n\n==== Sports ====\n\nEstadio Centenario, the national football stadium in Parque Batlle, was opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay's first constitution. In this World Cup, Uruguay won the title game against Argentina by 4 goals to 2. The stadium has 70,000 seats. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums, along with Maracan\u00e3, Wembley Stadium, San Siro, Estadio Azteca, and Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. A museum located within the football stadium has exhibits of memorabilia from Uruguay's 1930 and 1950 World Cup championships. Museum tickets give access to the stadium, stands, locker rooms and playing field.Between 1935 and 1938, the athletics track and the municipal velodrome were completed within Parque Batlle. The Tabar\u00e9 Athletic Club is occasionally made over as a carnival theatre using impermanent materials.\n\nToday the vast majority of teams in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n come from Montevideo, including Nacional, Pe\u00f1arol, Central Espa\u00f1ol, Cerrito, Cerro, Danubio, Defensor Sporting, Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9nix, Liverpool, Wanderers, Racing, River Plate, Club Atl\u00e9tico Torque and Rampla Juniors.\nBesides Estadio Centenario, other stadiums include Estadio Campeon del Siglo, Pe\u00f1arol, Gran Parque Central, Belvedere, Complejo Rentistas, Jardines del Hip\u00f3dromo, Jos\u00e9 Pedro Damiani, \"La Bombonera\", Luis Franzini, Luis Tr\u00f3ccoli and the park stadiums of Abraham Paladino, Alfredo V\u00edctor Viera, Omar Saroldi, Jos\u00e9 Nasazzi, Osvaldo Roberto, Maracan\u00e1 and Palermo.\nThe city has a tradition as host of major international basketball tournaments including the official 1967 FIBA World Cup and the 1988 1997 and 2017 editions of the official Americas Basketball Championship.\nThe Uruguayan Basketball League is headquartered in Montevideo and most of its teams are from the city, including Defensor Sporting, Bigu\u00e1, Aguada, Goes, Malv\u00edn, Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tica, and Trouville. Montevideo is also a centre of rugby; equestrianism, which regained importance in Montevideo after the Maro\u00f1as Racecourse reopened; golf, with the Club de Punta Carretas; and yachting, with the Puerto del Buceo, an ideal place to moor yachts. The Golf Club of Punta Carretas was founded in 1894 covers all the area encircled by the west side of Bulevar Artigas, the Rambla (Montevideo's promenade) and the Parque Rod\u00f3 (Fun Fair).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChurch and state are officially separated since 1916 in Uruguay. The religion with most followers in Montevideo is Roman Catholicism and has been so since the foundation of the city. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montevideo was created as the Apostolic Vicariate of Montevideo in 1830. The vicariate was promoted to the Diocese of Montevideo on 13 July 1878. Pope Leo XIII elevated it to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese on 14 April 1897. The new archdiocese became the Metropolitan of the suffragan sees of Canelones, Florida, Maldonado\u2013Punta del Este, Melo, Mercedes, Minas, Salto, San Jos\u00e9 de Mayo, Tacuaremb\u00f3.\nMontevideo is the only archdiocese in Uruguay and, as its Ordinary, the archbishop is also Primate of the Catholic Church in Uruguay. The archdiocese's mother church and thus seat of its archbishop is Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n y San Felipe y Santiago. As of 2010, the current Archbishop of Montevideo is Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet, SDB, since his appointment on 11 February 2014.Other religious faiths in Montevideo are Protestantism, Umbanda, Judaism, and there are many people who define themselves as Atheists and Agnostics, while others profess \"believing in God but without religion\".\n\n\n==== Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral ====\n\nThe Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Roman Catholic church of Montevideo. It is located in Ciudad Vieja, immediately across Constitution Square from the Cabildo. In 1740 a brick church was built on the site. In 1790, the foundation was laid for the current neoclassical structure. The church was consecrated in 1804. Bicentennial celebrations were held in 2004.\nIn 1897, Pope Leo XIII elevated the church to Metropolitan Cathedral status. Important ceremonies are conducted under the direction of the Archbishop of Montevideo. Weddings and choral concerts are held here and the parish priest conducts the routine functions of the cathedral. In the 19th century, its precincts were also used as a burial place of famous people who died in the city. For decades, the prison and the nearby Punta Carretas parish church were the only major buildings in the neighbourhood.\n\n\n==== Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n ====\n\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (\"Our Lady of the Sacred Heart\"), also known as Iglesia Punta Carretas (\"Punta Carretas Church\"), was built between 1917 and 1927 in the Romanesque Revival style. The church was originally part of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, but is presently in the parish of the Ecclesiastic Curia. Its location is at the corner of Solano Garc\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 Ellauri. It has a nave and aisles. The roof has many vaults. During the construction of the Punta Carretas Shopping complex, major cracks developed in the structure of the church as a result of differential foundation settlement.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is the economic and political centre of the country. Most of the largest and wealthiest businesses in Uruguay have their headquarters in the city. Since the 1990s the city has undergone rapid economic development and modernization, including two of Uruguay's most important buildings\u2014the World Trade Center Montevideo (1998), and Telecommunications Tower (2000), the headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company ANTEL, increasing the city's integration into the global marketplace.The Port of Montevideo, in the northern part of Ciudad Vieja, is one of the major ports of South America and plays a very important role in the city's economy. The port has been growing rapidly and consistently at an average annual rate of 14 percent due to an increase in foreign trade. The city has received a US$20 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to modernize the port, increase its size and efficiency, and enable lower maritime and river transportation costs.The most important state-owned companies headquartered in Montevideo are: AFE (railways), ANCAP (Energy), Administracion Nacional de Puertos (Ports), ANTEL (telecommunications), BHU (savings and loan), BROU (bank), BSE (insurance), OSE (water & sewage), UTE (electricity). These companies operate under public law, using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called Ente Autonomo (\"autonomous entity\"). The government also owns part of other companies operating under private law, such as those owned wholly or partially by the CND (National Development Corporation).\nBanking has traditionally been one of the strongest service export sectors in Uruguay: the country was once dubbed \"the Switzerland of America\", mainly for its banking sector and stability, although that stability has been threatened in the 21st century by the recent global economic climate. The largest bank in Uruguay is Banco Republica (BROU), based in Montevideo. Almost 20 private banks, most of them branches of international banks, operate in the country (Banco Santander, BBVA, ABN AMRO, Citibank, among others). There are also a myriad of brokers and financial-services bureaus, among them Ficus Capital, Galfin Sociedad de Bolsa, Europa Sociedad de Bolsa, Dar\u00edo Cukier, GBU, Horde\u00f1ana & Asociados Sociedad de Bolsa, etc.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism accounts for much of Uruguay's economy. Tourism in Montevideo is centered in the Ciudad Vieja area, which includes the city's oldest buildings, several museums, art galleries, and nightclubs, with Sarand\u00ed Street and the Mercado del Puerto being the most frequented venues of the old city. On the edge of Ciudad Vieja, Plaza Independencia is surrounded by many sights, including the Sol\u00eds Theatre and the Palacio Salvo; the plaza also constitutes one end of 18 de Julio Avenue, the city's most important tourist destination outside of Ciudad Vieja. Apart from being a shopping street, the avenue is noted for its Art Deco buildings, three important public squares, the Gaucho Museum, the Palacio Municipal and many other sights. The avenue leads to the Obelisk of Montevideo; beyond that is Parque Batlle, which along with the Parque Prado is another important tourist destination. Along the coast, the Fortaleza del Cerro, the Rambla (the coastal avenue), 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) of sandy beaches, and Punta Gorda attract many tourists, as do the Barrio Sur and Palermo barrios.The Ministry of Tourism offers a two-and-a-half-hour city tour and the Montevideo Tourist Guide Association offers guided tours in English, Italian, Portuguese and German. Apart from these, many private companies offer organized city tours.\nMost tourists to the city come from Argentina, Brazil and Europe, with the number of visitors from elsewhere in Latin America and from the United States growing every year, thanks to an increasing number of international airline arrivals at Carrasco International Airport as well as cruises that arrive into the port of Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\nMontevideo has over 50 hotels, mostly located in the city centre or along the beachfront of the Rambla de Montevideo.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nMontevideo is the heartland of retailing in Uruguay. The city has become the principal centre of business and real estate, including many expensive buildings and modern towers for residences and offices, surrounded by extensive green spaces. In 1985, the first shopping centre in Rio de la Plata, Montevideo Shopping was built. In 1994, with building of three more shopping complexes such as the Shopping Tres Cruces, Portones Shopping, and Punta Carretas Shopping, the business map of the city changed dramatically. The creation of shopping complexes brought a major change in the habits of the people of Montevideo. Global firms such as McDonald's and Burger King etc. are firmly established in Montevideo.\nApart from the big shopping complexes, the main retailing venues of the city are: most of 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro and Cord\u00f3n barrios, a length of Agraciada Avenue in the Paso de Molino area of Belvedere, a length of Arenal Grande St. and the\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nOut of the 100 radio stations found in Uruguay, 40 of them are in Montevideo. The city has a vibrant artistic and literary community. The press enjoyed full freedom until the advent of the Civic-military dictatorship (1973\u20131985); this freedom returned on 1 March 1985, as part of the restoration of democracy.\nSome of the important newspapers published in the city are: Brecha, La Republica, El Observador, El Pa\u00eds, Gaceta Comercial and La Diaria. El D\u00eda was the most prestigious paper in Uruguay, founded in 1886 by Jos\u00e9 Batlle, who would later go on to become President of Uruguay. The paper ceased production in the early 1990s. All television stations have their headquarters in Montevideo, for example: Saeta Channel 10, Teledoce, Channel 4 and National Television (Channel 5)\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte (DNT), part of the national Ministry of Transport and Public Works, is responsible for the organization and development of Montevideo's transport infrastructure. A bus service network covers the entire city. An international bus station, the Tres Cruces Bus Station, is located on the lower level of the Tres Cruces Shopping Center, on the side of Artigas Boulevard. This terminal, along with the Baltazar Brum Bus Terminal (or Rio Branco Terminal) by the Port of Montevideo, handles the long distance and intercity bus routes connecting to destinations within Uruguay.\n\nThe State Railways Administration of Uruguay (AFE) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the Empalme Olmos, San Jose and Florida. These lines operate to major suburban areas of Canelones, San Jos\u00e9 and Florida. Within the Montevideo city limits, local trains stop at Lorenzo Carnelli, Yatai (Step Mill), Sayago, Columbus (line to San Jose and Florida), Pe\u00f1arol and Manga (line Empalme Olmos) stations. The historic 19th century General Artigas Central Station located in the neighbourhood of Aguada, six blocks from the central business district, was abandoned 1 March 2003 and remains closed. A new station, 500 metres (1,600 ft) north of the old one and part of the Tower of Communications modern complex, has taken over the rail traffic.Carrasco International Airport (IATA: MVD, ICAO: SUMU), which serves Montevideo, is located 19 km (12 mi) from the city centre. Several international airlines operate there. The airport serves over 1,500,000 passengers annually. \u00c1ngel S. Adami Airport is a private airport operated by minor charter companies.\n\n\n==== Public transportation statistics ====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Montevideo, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 65 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 18% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.2 km, while 6% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n==== Port ====\n\nThe port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbour entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of R\u00edo de la Plata, Buenos Aires.\nThe main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, until the 21st century, physical changes had ceased, and since that time the area had degraded due to national economic stagnation.The port's proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.Every year more than one hundred cruises arrive, bringing tourists to Montevideo by public or private tours.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Public education ===\nThe University of the Republic is the country's largest and most important university, with a student body of 81,774, according to the census of 2007. It was founded on 18 July 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its current Rector is Dr. Rodrigo Arocena. The university houses 14 faculties (departments) and various institutes and schools. Many eminent Uruguayans have graduated from this university, including Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Jos\u00e9 Luis Massera, Gabriel Paternain, Mario Wschebor, Roman Fresnedo Siri, Carlos Ott and Eladio Dieste\nThe process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time.\n\n\n=== Private education ===\nThe largest private university in Uruguay, is also located in Montevideo. ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942, and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996, becoming the second private educational institution in the country to achieve that status. It is a member of World ORT, an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nThe university has about 8,000 students, distributed among 5 faculties and institutes, mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering. Its current rector as of 2010 is Dr. Jorge A. Gr\u00fcnberg.\nThe Montevideo Crandon Institute is an American School of missionary origin and the main Methodist educational institution in Uruguay. Founded in 1879 and supported by the Women's Society of the Methodist Church of the United States, it is one of the most traditional and emblematic institutions in the city inculcating John Wesley's values. Its alumni include presidents, senators, ambassadors and Nobel Prize winners, along with musicians, scientists, and others. The Montevideo Crandon Institute boasts of being the first academic institution in South America where a home economics course was taught.\n\nThe Christian Brothers of Ireland Stella Maris College is a private, co-educational, not-for-profit Catholic school located in the wealthy residential southeastern neighbourhood of Carrasco. Established in 1955, it is regarded as one of the best high schools in the country, blending a rigorous curriculum with strong extracurricular activities. The school's headmaster, history professor Juan Pedro Toni, is a member of the Stella Maris Board of Governors and the school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Its long list of distinguished former pupils includes economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school's alumni club.\nAlso in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo, one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, founded in 1908 with \"the object of giving children a complete education, both intellectual and moral, based upon the ideas and principles of the best schools in The British Isles\".\nThe School is governed by the Board of Governors, elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay, whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay. Prominent alumni include former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry Herr\u00e1n and Gabriel Gurm\u00e9ndez Armand-Ugon.\nLocated in Cordon, St.Brendan's school, previously named St.Catherine's is a non-profit civil association, which has a solid institutional culture with a clear vision of the future. It is knowned for being one of the best schools in the country, joining students from the wealthiest parts of Montevideo, such us, Punta Carretas, Pocitos, Malvin and Carrasco.\nSt. Brendan's School is a bilingual, non-denominational school that promotes a pedagogical constructivist approach focused on the child as a whole. In this approach, understanding is built from the connections children make between their own prior knowledge and the learning experiences, thus developing critical thinking skills. It is also the only school in the country implementing the three International Baccalaureate Programmes. These are:\n\nDiploma Programme \u2013 Pre-University course for students aged 16 to 19. The Diploma Programme is a two-year curriculum.\nMYP -Middle Years Programme. For students aged 12 to 16.\nPYP \u2013 Primary Years Programme. For students aged 3 to 12.Other educational institutions of note include Colegio Ingles, Instituto Preuniversitario Salesiano Juan XXIII, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Montevideo, Ivy Thomas, German School of Montevideo and Colegio Preuniversitario Ciudad de San Felipe.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nIn Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by polyclinics and hospitals or sanatorios. The term hospital is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while sanatorio is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.\n\n\n=== Public hospitals ===\nHospital de Cl\u00ednicas \"Dr. Manuel Quintela\" is a University Hospital attached to the University of the Republic, and is located on Avenida Italia. It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928\u20131929 and has a surface area of 110,000 square metres (1,200,000 sq ft) on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr. Hugo Villar, who was a considerable influence on the institution.\nHospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaran\u00ed and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of Jos\u00e9 Toribio (son of Tom\u00e1s Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaran\u00ed street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaran\u00ed and 25 de Mayo) and Juli\u00e1n Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Est\u00e9vez in 1798.Hospital Pereira Rossell was founded in 1908 and was built on land donated in late 1900 by Alexis Rossell y Rius and Dolores Pereira de Rossell. It was the city's first pediatric hospital, and shortly afterwards the addition of an obstetric and gynaecological clinic in 1915 made it the first maternity hospital as well. Later, the hospital received a donation from Dr. Enrique Pouey for a radiotherapy unit.\nHospital Vilardeb\u00f3 is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist Teodoro Vilardeb\u00f3 Matuliche, it opened 21 May 1880. The hospital was originally one of the best of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel. It has an emergency service, outpatient, clinic and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others. The average patient age is 30 years; more than half of the patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.\nOther public polyclinics and hospitals of note include the Hospital Saint Bois, founded 18 November 1928, which consists of a General Hospital and Eye Hospital; the Pasteur Hospital in La Uni\u00f3n neighbourhood; the Hospital Espa\u00f1ol, which was founded in 1886, passed to the private sector in the 20th century, closed in 2004 and was restored and reinaugurated in 2007 as the municipal Juan Jose Crottogini Polyclinic; the National Cancer Institute; and the National Institute of Trauma and Orthopedics.\n\n\n=== Private healthcare ===\nPrivate healthcare is offered by many private health insurance companies, each of which has one or more polyclinics and owns or is associated with one or more hospitals. Private medical facilities of note include the Hospital Brit\u00e1nico, the Italian Hospital of Montevideo, Mutualista CASMU's Sanatoria I, II, III and IV, the Evangelical Hospital, M\u00e9dica Uruguaya, Sanatorio de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, Sanatorios del C\u00edrculo Cat\u00f3lico, Sanatorio Casa de Galicia and Sanatorio GREMCA.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nMontevideo is twinned with:\n\nMontevideo is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities since 12 October 1982.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nAlbes, Edward.

          "Right off a really nice square it's worth taking some time out to pop inside here. It's really peaceful and uncommercialised as well as being beautiful. Cathedrals can all be a bit similar, but there's something about this one which avoids that. The interior is completely",

          "If you are visiting Montevideo you can\u00b4t miss the Catedral Metropolitana. It is one of the iconic buildings in the Ciudad Vieja (Old City). You can visit it from Monday to Friday from abt 11.00 until 19.00. One of my favorite places is the small chapel (my husband and I",
          "While browsing trough the city, we hopped into the cathedral. Entrance is free, of course, so just hop in. The architecture is absolutely stunning, with its high arches and cool temperatures. Plenty of sculptures to gasp at.",

          "Huge Catholic Cathederal, quite stunning even though it commands little respect nowadays in Uruguay. Not worth a special visit if you have access to Spanish Churches.",
          "I like that they did not charge you to enter this cathedral. It's not massive nor particularly ornate but it has some pretty alters and statues dotted around. Not somewhere I would make a special visit to see but worth visiting if passing.",
          "Very soothing feel to the place and perfect place to wander looking at impressive art and architecture.",
          "If you saw it from the outside, you'll be unimpressed because it doesn't look like much on the outside, especially if you're viewing it from the park just in front of it. For this reason, others didn't want to bother with it, while I did. There are plenty of sculptures to see",
          "This is a very beautiful cathedral - inside - the outside is rather plain. It has a lot of beautiful alters and statues, and the (fake) marble is also beautiful. Quickly seen though.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral, a very calm place that you can spend some time to tune out and contemplate thoughts.",
          "Similar to the cathedral in BA, pretty small potatoes - much too late to be interesting in terms of architecture and little if any art of interest.",
          "My wife and I try to visit an historic church everywhere we travel. cathedral Matrix was lovely and a testament to the draftsmanship of days gone by along with the faith in God that seems also to have wained. Stunning architecture and great spirit. It is quite certain",
          "Like all cities. Everything evolved around the plaza and the Cathedral is a must in Spanish cities. It is an old church, not luxurious like others around the world. Uruguay was not rich like Peru or Colombia. They had gold and silver. It is a standard church, nothing too",
          "Is one of the best church i. Uruguay. Cathedral is at ciudad vieja and the location is at plaza matriz. Really good from spanish colonia",

          "This Cathedral in the old part of Montevideo is worth the walk. The Cathedral itself is beautiful and rivals most European city cathedrals. It is well-kept but the highlights are the many pretty side altars. We attended a Saturday evening Mass and it was held at one of those",
          "Very beautiful church, well maintained and full of details. It seems to be closed, but you can open the door and come inside. From the outside seems to be an ok place, but inside is wonderful!",
          "Lovely cathedral from the early 1800s on the Plaza de Matriz. You don't need to spend too much time in side, but do bring your camera!",
          "Don't plan to spend too much time in Montevideo. It is an old tired city which does not hold a candle to its compatriot city to the south, Punta del Este. We were on a city tour off of a Celebrity ship. The guide did his best to make this tour lively but the material was not",

          "The interior it's not reflected by its deceiving exterior. It's a classic Spanish style cathedral with two bell towers, distanced a short walk from the central Plaza Independencia. This renovated neo classical Cathedral is the venue for many of the city\u2019s society weddings.",
          "This church was quiet elegant for a smaller cathedral. It has wonderful sides where people can sit and pray or contemplate. A high ranking bishop, I think as I couldn't read Spanish) has a marble crypt surrounded with beautiful, life-sized marble figures along with the bishop",
          "Catedral Matriz is on par with the great Cathedrals of Latin America. The most beautiful baptismal chamber I have ever seen. Wonderful sculptures and frescos. Our teenage boys were captivated, and they are a tough audience!",

          "Entering the cathedral shortly after the custodian unlocked the gates at 10Am we immediately saw our opportunity to see all of the cathedral before the 11Am service. It is well developed with several altars dedicated to Uroguay devotion.",
          "The exterior of this catedral is deceiving. It don't reflect the beautiful interior! Unlike many catedrals I had been to, this catedral is bright, showing off the real beauty and brilliance of all the sculptures, fixtures, finishing etc.!",
          "We walked the streets of the old walled city towards the cathedral. It was a good walk on an easy slope. The church was another one of those old churches you see in the former Spanish colonies. Built large, with high ceilings and statuary. Cool inside, with a multitude of small",
          "It's a nice church. We always go to churches to light a candle. This is beautiful but not amazing like other cathedrals",
          "While in Montevideo,.This beautiful cathedral is a wonderful example of the historical architecture of the city .The builders used a lot of marble .The history of Uruguay is evident with many heroes buried in the building.",

          "Lovely cathedral with numerous side alcoves. Lot of Ecuadorean history here with local heroes buried inside. Well worth 30 minutes or more of your time",
          "Great looking cathedral. Nice ceilings, nice sculptures, chandeliers. Convenient as it is in the center of the old city. Worth seeing.",
          "Very well kept and astonishing religious decoration, marble, wood and glass are mixed in elegant forms and colorful spaces. It is with no doubt a must to visit. Definitivamente preciosa Catedral en donde se mezclan vitrales, im\u00e1genes talladas y cultural bien mantenida.",
          "The renovated neo classical Cathedral faces the Cabildo and is the venue for many of the city\u2019s society weddings. Lots of hystory inside!. On the same side of the square you\u2019ll find the Gurvich Museum, which contains a small collection of paintings, ceramics and wood carvings",
          "Very European style Cathedral, side chapels and lots of Marble and gold. The stained glass windows are very high up but I photograohed as best I could. Definitely nicer inside than out and definitely a must visit on any city walking tour.",
          "Located on Plaza Matriz and close to Plaza de Independencia, this is Uruguay's main cathedral. It's beautiful inside with lots of history, worth a visit.",
          "Short walk from the central Plaza de Independencia, is another square, dominated with this cathedral. It's a classic Spanish style cathedral with two bell towers. If it was in other, more interesting city you would probably just pass it seeing it over your shoulder. Luckily, it",
          "Very nice example of Spanish Colonial Architecture. Seems very well cared for and visited. Pretty. Located in Plaza Matriz, aka Plaza Constituci\u00f3n. Also next to restaurant El Corte, where president Bush dined during his state visit in 2007.",
          "This cathedral has several names, Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception as well as the Cathedral Metropolitana de Montevideo. It is located across the street from a park. It is the oldest public building in the city. There are notables from Uruguay buried here. It is open",
          "Well worth a visit if you are in the area. It's very pretty and has a lot going on. I'm not sure if it's the most impressive I've seen as it's sold but worth a visit nether the less. Close to independence square and a easy walk.",
          "This Beautiful Catedrel on Calle Sarandi, is worth a visit, the architecture inside is stunning, as well as the art work in the beautiful Alters, lots of history here as well, and it's on the the edge of Plaza Constitucion.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral with a fantastic history. Not much from the outside but truly stunning in the inside. Gift shop has some lovely gifts at wonderful prices. Definitely worth a visit even if you are not a religious person. The sanctity of the Cathedral is breathtaking as is",
          "It's small if compared to other around the world. But it's sure very beautiful. If you'd like somewhere quiet and looking for some spiritual fresh up, go there and take some moments for your prayers.",
          "beautiful cathedral in the middle of Montevideo. Take a few minutes to walk around, noticing the ground and beautiful altars. We did not attend mass here. The square out front is stunning too.",
          "I attended Sunday mass with hundreds of people who did not seem to know one another. The organ above was massive and the choir sounded traditional. The massive Methodist Church nearby (25 minute walk) seemed small by comparison. The interior seemed the size of a football field",
          "This old church is a pretty building.The inside also good.Like any other old churches in the region.If you like churches go in or give it a miss.",
          "This is the main Catholic Church in Uruguay's capital city, Montevideo.It's history gioes back to the early 1600's. Lovely colonial building.",
          "Other than the Latin American churches normally, this cathederal is quite moderate. Still it has beautiful lines and the interior is very nice.",
          "Loved the well kept Cathedral, and it's beautiiful statues as well as the beautiful floor decor. A singularity is the existence of the old virgin Patron of Uruguay, the Virgin of the 33 Orientales that is still kept at the Cathedral. A church where you can still pray without",
          "In the middle of Old City, the Catedral looks very simple outside, but is wonderful inside and deserve the visit. Spend some time walking around the neighborhood to know Ciudad Vieja.",
          "Although very simple on the outside, the Roman Catholic Cathedral Matriz in Montevideo is pretty and peaceful in the inside. This Colonial Neoclassical style Basilica is more than 200 years old. It took 14 years to be built from 1790 thru 1804. It is located in the \"Ciudad Vieja",
          "The Metropolitan Cathedral is the mother church of Uruguay, hence La Matriz, and holds the tombs of some of the most famous Uruguayans. The bell tower figured quite prominently in history itself. (See below). The cathedral is over 200 years old, and therefore predates Uruguay",
          "The interior of the cathedral does not have the riches of other South American churches. It remains simple in style and perhaps more in keeping with its original religious function.",
          "This is a must if in this area of town. We stopped by here one evening as a mass had just ended and the inside of the building was beautiful. Everything was taken care of very well and the details in the architecture was great.",
          "The interior is amazingly bright, painted in reflective white showing off the wonderful alter and stained glass. The copula is amazing to see.",

          "Not the grandest basilica in the world, but a worthwhile stop-off on the Plaza Matriz (aka Plaza Constitucion). Pretty baptistry and the tombs of Lavalleja and Presidents Suarez and Rivera. Mass schedule is pretty limited",
          "Nice cathedral with many statutes and stain glass windows. Nice respite if it is warm outside and there are many nooks and crannies that are worth exploring.",
          "History and religion melt here. Great place to visit, know abour history and Pray. Great maintenance and excellent mass in the little chapel dedicated to Our Mother Mery. Virgen de Monserrat has an outstanding place . Nice shop to buy some mementos.",
          "It is a nice place to get to know a little more about the history of the country and the city. It has beautiful statues and it is a very calm place to stop and sit in peace.",
          "This House of GOD is not just another Olde Church. There is a different aura about it. With the blend of statuary, art, and artifacts this church has it's own character. Slowly move through the church and take it all in.",
          "Located in Plaza Matriz, this catholic church has a beautiful interior and is worth seeing if you're passing by. Many notable Uruguayans are interred here, including former presidents, military leaders and priests. The cathedral was declared a National Historic Monument in 1975.",
          "The Metropolitan Cathedral, also called Iglesia Matriz, is the main church in Uruguay, and one of the oldest. In front of Plaza Matriz, it is in the Ciudad Vieja (ancient city).",
          "The cathedral is worth a visit, it respires calm and even grandeur. The 'plaza' in front is kept clean, and on saturdays and sundays there is a small antique market.",
          "I was lucky to visit during Sunday evening Mass. The Cathedral was packed, giving the mass great atmosphere, and the service was truly impressive (even for a total agnostic). Cathedral's interior is beautifully preserved, and it is one of the more elaborate in South America.",
          "Stunning Cathedral in the heart of the old town. Well worth a visit to have a look around and for some quiet reflection.",
          "We stopped here for a visit while on our own self-guided walking tour of historic Montevideo, & this cathedral has a beautiful early 19th century interior. The exterior facades don't do it justice. The only thing that would've made our visit more enjoyable would've been",
          "If you are in Montevideo, visiting the cathedral is a great way to get into the history of the city. If you are lucky (like i was) you can even meet the arch-bishop of Montevideo (uruguay's most important religious authority) and he may want to show you around.",
          "I love this little cathedral. The colors are lovely, it's never crowded, there are frequently people actually praying or meditating (nice thing in a church), and often there are gregorian chants or other early church music playing softly and piped throughout.",
          "Worth a visit if you're passing by, but nothing special to see here. It's just another church. Not too bad, not too great.",
          "This Cathdral dates from Spanish colonial times. The church constructed of brick was built in 1790,It is a neoclassical structure. Was consecrated in 1804. Inside they are buried important Uruguayans :Antonio Mar\u00eda Barbieri (1892-1979),Venancio Flores (1808-1868), D\u00e1maso",
          "This catedral has a lot of history from Uruguay in general and Montevideo and surrounders in particular. Deserve a visit, and is well preserved.",
          "I love the plaza and the environment where the cathedral is located. A good place to enjoy a cup of coffee or an ice cream.",
          "Located at Plaza Matriz(Constitucion). The best day to visit is on saturdays, when theres's a antiques fair at the plaza.",
          "A modest church building with a nice, relaxed atmosphere. No spectacular works of art, just a well preserved expression of 19th century religious architecture.",
          "we ate here several times, and the staff are very helpful, they have a varied menu from steaks to hot dogs and chavitas, a Uruguayan sandwich",
          "Unlike many cathedrals which have a cold austere feeling, this cathedral is warm and inviting giving the sense that it is a current place of worship and not a \"museum\".",
          "Its a nice church -- but not unlike any other I've seen before. If you are bored and have nothig else to do - take a look..",
          "It is a church a little bigger but not a real Catedral. Nothing special there, maybe only the simplicity of the place which should combines with the catholic faith.",
          "Well preserved church, nice height and depth. The wall at first appear to be all marble and then you realize that it's all plaster with faux finish\u2026 Doesn't make it that leas enjoyable, just goes to show how far you can go with \"tromp l'oeil\"",
          "Being catholic and Spanish speaker , I was lucky that Sunday Mass was about to start when I got there so I stayed for the Mass and found it to be very solemn. As with any temple around the world there are the uneducated visitors walking around the church with a baseball hat.",
          "Nice plaza and church in the old city make a nice place to sit in this historic part of town. Good restaurants and ice cream stand there are worth a look, especially the La Caserita Restaurant on the corner, good pizza and beer. Strange not mentioned here in the restaurant",
          "The cathedral was similar to many that you may visit in Europe and South America, but nothing spectacular. There is a nice park that on Saturdays is full with peolple selling antiques.",
          "A very intersting place to visit. Take your time and gather in what the place represents and what has occured there. Easy to find and a place that is very peaceful.",
          "No, nothing bad occurred. However, I was amazed that there was no security in such a beautiful location as the Catedral Matriz. Being from the US, we are very familiar with security in all places especially in public places like museums, galleries and other similar venues.",
          "Great Church with nice little details. The square off this church is pleasant with great mature trees and nice places to sit. When I went through there were stalls with people selling their wares. Good place to stop and relax as the area has cafes with outdoor seating.",
          "the catherdal in the centre of the city of Montevideo , just next to the plaza del presidente is well worth a visit. beautiful images of the madona . the intricately carved wooden pulpit and the stained glass with our lady of Assumtion is to be admired.",
          "This cathedral is not as ornate or spectacular as others you might find but it is worth a visit. The use of purple colours around the alter give it a different feel. Look out for the very old baptismal font that was used for the baptism of the Uruguayan hero Artigas. The plaza",

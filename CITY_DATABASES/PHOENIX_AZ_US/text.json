        "wiki": "Desert Botanical Garden is a 140-acre (57 ha) botanical garden located in Papago Park, at 1201 N. Galvin Parkway in Phoenix, central Arizona.\nFounded by the Arizona Cactus and Native Flora Society in 1937 and established at this site in 1939, the garden now has more than 50,000 plants, in more than 4,000 taxa, one-third of which are native to the area, including 379 species, which are rare, threatened or endangered.\nOf special note are the rich collections of agave (4,026 plants in 248 taxa) and cacti (13,973 plants in 1,320 taxa), especially the Opuntia sub-family. Plants from less extreme climate conditions are protected under shadehouses. It focuses on plants adapted to desert conditions, including an Australian collection, a Baja California collection and a South American collection. Several ecosystems are represented: a mesquite bosque, semidesert grassland, and upland chaparral.\nDesert Botanical Garden has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1930s, a small group of local citizens became interested in conserving the fragile desert environment. One was Swedish botanist Gustaf Starck, who found like-minded residents by posting a sign, \u201cSave the desert,\u201d with an arrow pointing to his home. In April 1934 they formed the Arizona Cactus and Native Flora Society (ACNFS) to sponsor a botanical garden to encourage an understanding, appreciation and promotion of the uniqueness of the world's deserts, particularly the local Sonoran Desert.Eventually Gertrude Webster, whose home encompassed all of what is today the neighborhood of Arcadia, joined the Society. She offered her encouragement, connections and financial support to establish the botanical garden in Papago Park. Margaret Bell Douglas provided support as well, donating 1,500 specimens to the herbarium.Webster served as president of the Society's first Board of Directors and Gustaf Starck, W. E. Walker, Rell Hasket, L. L. Kreigbaum, and Samuel Wilson were the five vice president. The latter also served as Treasurer. Paul G. Olsen was Secretary. In 1938, after much work by the ACNFS, the board hired the Garden's first executive director, George Lindsay, who oversaw the first planting on the grounds. The Desert Botanical Garden opened in 1939 as a non-profit museum dedicated to research, education, conservation and display of desert plants.\n\n\n== Education & Art ==\nThe Garden offers specialized tours, workshops and lectures on desert landscaping and horticulture, nature art and photography, health and wellness . \nThe Garden presents Spring and Fall open-air acoustic concert series, art exhibitions, and Las Noches de las Luminarias since 1978. The Luminarias Festival became a Southwestern Holiday tradition featuring live music by the flickering lights of 8000 hand-lit luminaria. \n\n\n== Volunteerism ==\nVolunteers were essential in the Garden's creation and development, when the staff was small and finances tight. These early supporters, including a few amateur botanists who donated their own plant collections, helped plan and execute plant sales, photography and art exhibits, and numerous public events.\nVolunteers remain a Garden asset, sharing their time, talents and professional expertise. They work closely with staff to maintain the Garden's status as a premier plant research institution and serve as members of the Board of Trustees, setting policy and governing the Garden.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of botanical gardens and arboretums in Arizona\nList of historic properties in Phoenix, Arizona\nList of botanical gardens in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Desert Botanical Garden website\n Geographic data related to Desert Botanical Garden at OpenStreetMap",

          "We went on a Sunday morning mid March. I am not a real desert plant kind of person, but this was a wonderful destination! The layout is easy to follow with a main path and areas off of that. The map helps a lot! We encountered several docents along the way that would explain",

          "A very peaceful and relaxing way to spend a few hours walking among some amazing cacti and local flora. The butterfly pavilion was a particular favourite and almost worth the price of admission on its own! Allow about 3 hours to walk around the entire site and make sure you wear",

          "This place was beautiful! Every plant is marked and there's a lot to learn. We could have done without the plastic animals but I understand the art and its meaning for the area. The gift shop was cute and had lots of interesting items. Overall it's a little pricey but I'm happy",

          "I have been to the Desert Botanical Garden several times, and I love it! The trails give you a variety of plants and attractions to view. I would recommend one thing though, when you enter they give you a large booklet (such a waste of paper!), I would skip that, and instead, I",
          "Improving every year. Great pathways and walkways through well displayed and identified native plants. We like the Spring the best because of all the blooming cactus. It is a wonderful place! There is also an onsite restaurant with inside and outside seating. Excellent!",
          "I make a point of visiting gardens when I travel, and this is a good one. I like the desert plants, so different from the plant life where I live. My friends and I enjoyed the guided tour, free with the price of admission, which is a little pricey. We had lunch on the terrace",

          "Who know there were so many different types of cactuses? Or is it cacti? I'm sure our helpful tour guide told us and I don't remember. Anyway, this is a wonderful wander through a desert landscape harsh and beautiful. We enjoyed taking a (free) tour and learning about the",
          "Beautiful and educational at the same time but is a bit pricey. Luckily we waited until we arrived to get tickets since the woman selling tickets asked if we were over 62 and qualified for senior price which was not on the website. Butterfly exhibit was really neat.",
          "If you go in the mornings during the week, the place is likely to be full of elementary school age kids and their teachers. Absolutely no chance you'll enjoy the visit. Go in the late afternoon or evening.",
          "This garden was GREAT! Large, SO MUCH variety, plenty of shady spots and water bottle fillers. Beautiful views, we would definitely recommend",

          "This was the first activity I took family visitors to do on their first time in Phoenix. The gardens are especially beautiful in the February/March time of year, because so many things are in bloom. I\u2019ve been here several times and never tire of visiting.",
          "We enjoyed the Beatles tribute band, Marmalade Skies in the garden, after watching the brilliant sunset. Most shows sell out, so get your tickets in advance and plan to arrive early enough to snag a table. Beverages are available for purchase, along with various snacks. This is",

          "The gardens were quite nice, but much larger than we expected. That would have been a bonus, except we had little kids with us and the walking was getting long, hot and dusty for them so we weren't able to see a very large fraction of the gardens. The admission and food prices",
          "The Desert Botanical Gardens is a great destination to meet up with friends and enjoy a day together. Easily accessible with plenty of free parking, the Garden offers many paths so even on a crowded day, you don't feel crushed by others. Many paths offer shade and places to sit",
          "Had a nice day for our first trip to the Phoenix Desert Botanical Garden. The weather was pleasant and the surroundings were tremendous. As snowbirds, we were impressed throughout. Awesome to the point that we plan to return sometime to take it all in. Don't forget to ask",
          "Wow! This botanic gardens is huge, we spent hours and didn't see everything. Some of the cactus and succulents are very unusual and things I had never seen before. They have a free day once a month, I think the second Tuesday of the month. Go on the free day and then treat",
          "We enjoyed the Desert Botanical Gardens very much, it was a beautiful day in Phoenix! We walked all the trails, this is a place we would return to for sure. We only spent a couple hours but you could easily plan to spend a half day and still not see everything. We didn\u2019t",

          "We visited the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix one afternoon. It is a definite must-see. Plan on spending 2-3 hours depending on how fast or slowly you walk through the gardens. Most the garden is level easy walking, but some sections are hilly. The hilly paths are marked.",

          "If you like the desert and its plants, this is the place to get it all in one place in a well laid-out and semi-guided format. Though there is, of course, risk of excessive sun exposure but there are plenty of opportunities for shade as well. We had no problem spending 6 hours",
          "We had a beautiful sunny day to walk the gardens. It\u2019s beautiful with many paths so it didn\u2019t seem crowded. Too bad we were too early for butterflies.",
          "My husband and I absolutely loved walking around looking at all the cacti, learning their names and seeing how they grow and bloom. Spring would be a great time to visit - we were a little early for flowers. Unfortunately my teenage girls and their friends were bored so we",

          "Went to the Botanical Garden as a part of my stay in the Phoenix area. If you like seeing and knowing more about the local flora, in this case that of the Sonoran Desert area, this is a great place to visit. Even better if you can visit in the early spring when the desert bloom",
          "Walking through the Garden consists of several distinct trails each looping into the other. The provided self-guiding map and book, and signposts along the trails, show clearly where to go. Many of the plants (varieties of cacti, agave, and others) have their own little",

          "This was on my list of things to see in Phoenix. Do catch one of the docent tours, there are more than what is on the web site, We went to the 11 a.m. docent tour. I enjoy nature and viewing plants in their natural environment. Plus, you know what you are seeing as you",
          "If you don't like the desert or it's plants or any of the desert environment, you'll still like the Desert Botanical Garden. After a week of old west stores and art galleries, the DBG was the perfect breakaway. Not only a joy to view but the pleasant walk, processing how people",
          "What a wonderful introduction to the landscape of the Phoenix and surrounding area. We joined a very informative tour lead by Sonny (?) and learned so much about adaptive plant life in the area. The gardens are beautifully kept. I would recommend visiting this site at the",
          "We really enjoyed our visit. Being winter yet, did not see the blooming of flowers, but still liked all of it. It is a bit confusing trying to get around without missing anything. Admission is a bit pricey.",

          "We paid $24.95 to get in thinking it was going to a beautiful experience after reading the reviews. We\u2019ve been to many botanical gardens but this one was a let down. It\u2019s the same plants a million times over. Nothing was bloomed so it literally was a million cacti. The best part",
          "We had our wedding brunch here. We had about 10 people all with different tastes and the restaurant accommodated everyone. The food was very good and they were very accommodating to food allergies. Kudos to the chef and the servers who ensured we had a fabulous brunch! I would",
          "This place it totally AMAZING. if you don't go and your in the Area Your Loss. I never knew there were so many different kinds of cactus. Also very unusual looking trees. They have neat trails to walk on, some curvy and mystical. Just beautiful. Also longer hiking trails if your",

          "I had been here once before, but coming again gave me a new appreciation for how big this place really is. What an enjoyable day just walking around and seeing all the beautiful cactus. Most of it is paved so a wheelchair can move smoothly. There were a couple of hills that",

          "Loved the gardens. The staff members were very helpful. I did feel the plastic animals were a bit much, I understand it is an art exhibit but I found it a detraction from the landscape. There were so many of them everywhere, I went to see native plants, not recycled plastic. I",
          "I loved it here. Yes the price was expensive, almost 80 dollars for 3 adults. I still loved it. They had the crackling art going on which was very cool and the plant life was so beautiful to see. We spent about 4 hours here and although we did not eat lunch there was a nice",

          "Wear comfortable shoes because many of the paths are off the main concrete path. You will see a variety of cactuses and other beautiful desert plants. If lucky you will spot some of the native species within the garden. Beware, if bringing young children who like to touch",

          "While we visited the Botanical Park years ago, it has really expanded and is an even more fascinating attraction in Phoenix today! We arrived at the park just moments before the next scheduled tour would be held. While we are normally not tour type of folks, we realized we stood",

          "Visited the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix. This is a great way to relax and take in nature on a beautiful day. It was busy, but did not hamper our enjoyment. They do a really nice job of caring for the trails and making it easy to navigate the grounds. A must see when",

          "I would not recommend going in January. We spent $30 a piece for a ticket and none of the cactuses had bloomed. It was very plain and definitely not worth the drive or the money. I think they need to lower the prices for this time of the year or at least make the public aware",
          "We found this place by accident, it was absolutely stunning the cacti garden was beautiful with information on the different cacti\u2019s in front of them. There is a lovely walk which is circular along with stunning views.",
          "We spent a relaxing Sunday walking through the Botanical Gardens. We enjoyed seeing all of the cactus and other southwestern plants that we don\u2019t see in Pennsylvania. The day we visited the temperature was perfect for walking. With miles of trails, it did not seem overly",

          "What a wonderful, relaxing place to walk! We were able to get in as seniors which reduced our cost by $2 each. It can be a lot of walking 2.5-3.0 miles if you want to see everything. Accessibility is not an issue. Paths are very wide. There is a restaurant on premise as well as",
          "What a remarkable area with vegetation and bird life. Enjoyed seeing quail, hummingbirds, roadrunner, doves, rabbits and more. Cool visiting exhibition of colorful animals and more. Hundreds of cactus.",
          "IMO, If you are under 30-35, definitely best to skip this attraction unless you are a cactus nut. In fact, here is a money saving idea. After I went in, I took some time to walk around OUTSIDE the grounds. ( plenty of cactus there ) and I saw practically everything there that I",
          "I so enjoy every visit to the Botanical Garden. We took a tour\u2014again\u2014and had lunch at Gertrudes\u2014again. This is a \u201cdon\u2019t miss\u201d attraction in Scottsdale if you have any interest in learning about the plants in the area.",
          "My husband and I spent 4 hours looking and learning about desert plants and environments. We took one of the free guided tours to start our visit. It was an excellent way to get an overview of how and what to look for. We walked each of the pathways, enjoying the information",

          "Unfortunately, we arrived about an hour after a rare rainstorm, and they kept one of the trails closed due to (IMO) an overabundance of caution. Nonetheless, and well curated and pleasant visit.",
          "This really is a must-see in Phoenix. It takes at least a couple of hours to see it all at a leisurely pace. There is a main loop, with four featured loops off this main loop. All of them are worth your time. It is great to see such a diversity of desert plants and the way",
          "So many beautiful plants and many varieties. We spent a lot of time here and plan to go back. We bought a membership on our way out and are looking forward to our next visit. Highly recommend.",
          "I have been here many times and never tire of seeing this attraction. Something about the desert and the peacefulness of this place makes it a tranquil yet intriguing attraction. From seasons to seasons, the Desert botanical garden offers great seasonal concerts, special",
          "This is a wonderful botanic garden especially for desert environments. We come at different times of the year and it is always different and IMO worthwhile. It is best in the Spring and Fall and actually before the high heat of Summer. Just Ok in Winter..not as colorful or as",
          "This was my second visit to the garden. The last time I went was for Las Noches de las Luminarias and that was beautiful. After that visit I wanted to see the garden during the day. I wasn't disappointed. The desert flora was impressive. I'll be visiting again.",
          "I loved this botanic garden it was really enjoyable, informative and relaxing. Loved the different areas of vegitation especially the semi wild segaro section where you got glimpses of native wildlife. The Native American huts were also beautiful. The only thing I didnt think",
          "Looking for something to do prior to our flight out of Phoenix on New Year's Eve, my family attended the luminary special event. Not much is open on New Year's Eve and while the lighted paths and entertainment were nice, we were unable to see much of the cacti plants which is",
          "Defiantly a nice way to see the ecology of Phoenix! It was a shock coming from the east coast and seeing how large the saguaro actually are! I defiantly liked the small chichuly installation in the beginning! Wish I noticed it earlier! A little crowded for my taste plus a lot",
          "Beautiful park. Amazing beauty made of cacti and succulents. More like a sculpture gallery than a garden! Good information. Amazing, huge cacti plants over a 100 years old!",
          "I couldn\u2019t believe how much my 11 year old son enjoyed walking around looking at the cactus and wildlife. Two hours flew by before we knew it. Going first thing in the morning was perfect since it was still cool out.",
          "We spent 4 hours here. Did the behind the scenes tour as well. Really enjoyed it and so did our teenagers. Highly recommended family activity.",
          "Very informative experience walking the grounds. Expect to spend at least 1-2 hours to see everything. Go early (arrive by 9:00am) as crowds build after 11:00am. Plan to walk at least 1- 1 1/2 miles.",
          "Noches de Luminarias We had such a great time at the event. Walking through the night with all of the luminaries was breathtaking. Combined with the local music and dancers. Well worth the ticket price.",
          "Beautiful way to learn more about the desert - amazing cacti! Great way to get your steps in. I would note it is slightly expensive for a family of four.",
          "We loved walking through the botanical garden. It was a little pricey for the two hours we had in the garden, since they were closing early for a private party. BUT, to us it was worth the money!!! Our girls loved checking out all the different varieties planted. We all",
          "I would rate the garden average because of the price and because I felt there were missed opportunities to educate the public on the plants and health of the environment. $29 per person was a little steep for the experience (hiking camelback mountain is free). We didn\u2019t do a",
          "The array of cacti is amazing. The different garden loops are unique. I spotted a cactus we inherited with a new house. I appreciate it more now in my garden. The succulents are beautiful and I wish I walked that area first as I really love succulents. We went during a special",

          "The gardens are beautiful and its amazing seeing so many cacti up close. We enjoyed walking around the various loops though did have some trouble knowing which way to go at times. To keep out little boy amused we embarked on a game of lizard spotting. In the end it was too easy",
          "We attended the evening \u201cLuminaria\u201d and it was a magical evening. Even my two college daughters and husband were enchanted. And, they all three asked if we could come back during the day to really get a good look at the cacti! This place is unlike any other botanical garden",
          "First - although it's not advertised, if you are an Auto Association member, you can receive $5 off an adult admission ticket which makes the entrance fee somewhat reasonable. All you need to is ask them. (Regular price is $24.95) For anyone that has never seen the desert and",

          "We had such a great time when we went to the night luminarie event. Had great heaters for those who were cool. Tons of acts, shows and people with great talent. For those who like to have a nice drink there were quite a few areas to buy some drinks. Even hot chocolate with",

          "Lovely gardens with all kinds of desert plants, useful explanations suitable also for children. In the evening the gardens were beautifully illuminated",
          "I met some friend in Phoenix and we decided to visit this botanical garden. It is so beautiful and big. Be prepared to walk a lot and take hundreds of pictures. There are so many different species of cactus that you won\u2019t realize the time passing.",

          "We visited in December so not exactly the best season to see a lot blooming, but it was an easy stroll through nicely designed gardens with signage describing various indigenous plants. We would definitley return to visit in the spring if in the area again.",
          "We saw quail, a roadrunner, butterflies, and bunnies. The crested saguaro on the historical trail is unlabeled but a must see. There are so many trails to walk. Beautiful if you enjoy succulents and cacti. Different plants bloom at different times of the year. The curation",
          "Being from the Midwest, I was pretty skeptical about walking through a bunch of cacti. Boy, was I wrong. The Desert Botanical Garden was beautiful! The plants are labeled so you actually know what you're looking at; the trails are well-marked and easily traversed; the exhibits",
          "I didn\u2019t plan on visiting the gardens but since the days in December are short, I wanted to do something in the evening before catching my flight. Searching the internet, I noticed that there were lightning displays after 5:30 pm in the garden, so we headed there. The way the",
          "We walked 2.3 miles exploring the gardens. I came to see a saguaro cactus \ud83c\udf35 and was not disappointed! Very clean, nice walking paths/buildings & cute shop. We took our time and spent about 2 hours. I thought it was worth the $ and definitely recommend going.",
          "The luminaries at night were beautiful and festive. However I was not thrilled with the plastic animal sculpture display. I felt it was more for children than adults.",
          "We take all of our friends and family who visit Phoenix. There is nothing like it. Every cactus you can imagine and more. Best to go during the cooler part of the year so you can see it all. We became members because we enjoy it so much. There is always something in bloom. A",
          "I was married in the gardens several years ago and it has become a staple of our daily lives. My husband and I are members and take full advantage of the special events that are organized throughout the year. We've seen the ballet, gone to Noche de las Luminarias, and enjoy",

          "I actually visited November of 2018 but anyway, it's a great place to have gone to on a whim. It's a very relaxing atmosphere and who knew there was so many variety of cacti?! Went with a friend and it's the perfect place to spend part of your day. Beautiful scenery for photos",
          "This is a well-designed garden with plenty of history, landscaping, and surprises along the way. The art exhibits rotate and there is always something new to see. Likewise, the foliage shows a variety of possibilities for sensible plantings at home, as well as here. Learn about",
          "The place is such fun. Don't miss the guided tour. There is so much more about desert environments than sand and cactus. There are beautiful flowers, plants lots of wildlife and great views. One of the highlights of our trip.",

          "Save your money. This was extremely disappointing. The lights were unimpressive and the animals were creepy. The performers were fine and I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s where my money was spent...since the candles that lit the path couldn\u2019t have cost >$35 pp!!",
          "I love the Botanical Gardens..but the special event Las Noches De Las Luminarias was very disappointing. The huge plastic animals were absolutely horrific and did not blend in well with the scenery..Poorly lit on pathway..and do you really need to have a bar outside..some people",
          "Well set out with some lit up plants and plastic animals after sunset. In one section is a Circle on the ground and if you face only in one direction there is an echo. When you go in face right. Also in one place is a view of the famous hole in the rock.",
          "This event is not deceptive with intention however, if you think it's one thing, and it's something else...what do you call it? Booze is flowing everywhere and you can tell many had hit the bottle hard. (Hint: tick tacks please) First (THIS IS A TICKETED NIGHT TIME EVENT).",
          "I did not really know what to expect at the Desert Botanical Garden, but I am so glad we decided to visit it! The plants were very interesting and the grounds were immaculately tended. I enjoyed several of the trails. I would definitely go back if I find myself in the area.",

          "Everything we read on what to do in Phoenix suggested the botanical gardens. Wasn\u2019t sure my husband would enjoy it but we decided to give it a try. It was better then expected. Very tranquil setting with tons of dessert plant life. We joined a tour and learned quite a bit about",
          "We went to stroll the well kept gardens with out of town company. One doesn\u2019t realize how many kinds of desert plants we have here in this beautiful state. Everything there is well marked and laid out, very impressive.",

          "The gardens, the art, the docents, the last day of the butterfly exhibit - it was all so perfect. And after walking for hours and learning so much, the margaritas we bought on the grounds during the Dia de Los Muertes celebrations completely revived us!",
          "We enjoyed strolling through the gardens and seeing all the different types of cacti in bloom. There was an exhibit with giant plastic snails that was interesting. There's very little shade in the gardens and it got pretty hot. The admission is $29 per person, which is kind",

          "We had not been to the Botanical Garden for years and then only at night for the Luminaries. Really enjoyed the many areas of the garden. Saw some amazing \ud83c\udf35 cactus and desert plants. We took advantage of the first Tuesday free admission. We would highly recommend a visit.",

          "We have been members of the Desert Botanical Garden (DBG) ever since we moved to the Valley of the Sun. We made a practice of bringing our visitors to the garden. Considering that the Sonoran desert is one of the wettest deserts, there is an amazing collection of desert plants.",

I\u2019ve also gone there with friends & family to enjoy the beauty of the garden. I\u2019ve never seen it over crowded",
          "A magnificent experience. Arrive early and you may be treated to animal activity. During my visit I saw snakes, hummingbirds, rabbits but missed the two owls people spoke about. Took me 90 minutes to walk the grounds and take in the exhibits. Found the garden to be relaxing.",
          "We went after 5pm for the discount and enjoyed a lot fo the park to ourselves. Several different trails and areas which showcased different aspects of plant life in the desert. An informative and scenic activity for serious plant lovers and those who just find them nice to look",

          "A little skeptical going in, but I throughly enjoyed it. It was pretty hot even for this Texas girl, but we stopped at the many water fountains scattered throughout. Who knew cactus could look so pretty?!!",
          "Although the admission fee is pricey ($25/person), it is worth it. There is also a 20% discount for AAA members and after 5pm it\u2019s $15/person. Regardless, the garden is wonderful. For someone who loves being outside, nature, and walking this place is great. There is wildlife",
          "The Sonoran Desert is very distinctive and the botanical garden offers a great guide to its abundant flora. And I do mean flora; this is a desert rich in flowers as well as cacti and other plants. The botanical garden itself is very well-run with helpful staff and volunteers. I",

          "Last week I visited the Desert Botanical Garden with a friend. I'd heard that it's a beautiful area, and now that I've seen it for myself, I have to agree. I'd go back again in a heartbeat. We were there in the morning before it got too hot, but even so, it was nice to find",
          "The food was delicious and varied, but I felt the pricing was high and don't know if I would drive there specifically to eat. I would certainly eat there if I were doing another day at the Botanical Gardens.",

          "One should definitely visit the garden when in Phoenix. Though there are a lot of trees to provide shades, try to be there in the early morning or be there in the afternoon to catch good snaps with the setti g Sun. Definitely carry a good camera to capture the amazing birds. The",

          "The collection is huge and covers a lot of ground. Put on good walking shoes (and in the summer, bring lots of water)! Things were starkly beautiful in June, showcasing things those of us in temperate climates never see. I'd love to go back in the early spring, when I'm sure the",
          "Not sure when developed a love for all things cactus, but this is the place to see them. Enjoyed seeing the variety and volume. It is large and takes some time to get through the entire exhibit. If you like this type of thing. It is worth a trip.",
          "Is June the best time to visit? Probably not, but the botanical garden is beautiful in all seasons. June gives you a true survival experience, as you walk around to enjoy the plants and living things. Definitely worthy of a trip.",

          "Extraordinary garden beautiful and well done. Benches, water and vending machines throughout. Wonderful visit and should not be missed. Take sunglasses and a hat. Use sunblock. If you do it leisurely it can take 3-4 hours. Cafe closed for the summer.",
          "I spent a couple of hours wandering through the fields of cacti. It was a wonderful experience. Also, there was quite a few small creatures living in the area.",
          "A wonderful display of desert flora. We wandered for about 90 minutes and we are not enthusiastic gardeners. I thought the entry fee of $24.95 was a bit steep.",
          "I had never given thought to the many different types of cactus and other varieties of desert plants until I toured the Desert Botanical Garden. The different sections were arranged to focus on the different types of cactus and different environments of the area. Pleasantly",
          "Exceeded expectations - very well maintained botanical garden, very interesting and educational. I went after 5pm when entry is cheaper and the temperature cooler. Was lucky enough to see plenty of wildlife as well as the plants (rabbits, hummingbirds, frogs, lizards). Highly",
          "I have always had a mild obsession with cacti but this took it to a new level! It was put together well and well manicured. So much to see and so little time. We went in the evening, and the light show at night was great. We were worried we wouldn\u2019t see at much because of the",
          "A beautiful place to stroll through and view the surprising variety of life that thrives in the desert! Parking is free, and there is plenty of space. Also, keep an eye out for desert fauna that make their home there, too! A great place for people of all ages.",

          "We figured we would kill some time here to see some of the local desert plants but wow we were surprised at the size and breadth of this place. There are 4 or 5 long trails to explore that really highlight the desert foliage and plants. It was a visual as well as a learning",
          "These gardens bring the depth of the desert to the heart of Phoenix. I recommend in summer to come in the evening to avoid the heat (cacti don\u2019t provide a lot of shade). Plus the sunset silhouette views are spectacular. Certainly worth the short drive to get there.",
          "This place is massive! I expected to have only spent an hour here at the most, but I can\u2019t believe how much there is to see and to take pictures of! I\u2019m sure the Garden is fun and visually appealing to locals, but if you don\u2019t live in an arid climate or new to the desert, this",
          "This is a beautifully put together and maintained garden that is worth a visit if you are not familiar with desert plants. We were here in late May and it was already hot, so make sure you have sunscreen (or for anything else you do in Arizona). Our whole family enjoyed the",
          "I came to Phoenix on business and decided to visit the garden. It was a very hot day and the gardens had wonderful shady spots to escape and cool off. Although the plant life was impressive, I didn\u2019t feel the experience was worth the entrance fee.",

          "This is totally worth the money! It is a little pricey but I thought it was well worth it! So many trails to walk around. Laid out very well to see everything. Get there early as it can get hot! I recommend ending with the wildflowers since there is more shaded areas there.",
          "1. Get there early if visiting during the warmer months. 2. Bring a water bottle, they have water stations through out the gsrdens. I really enjoyed this garden, we arrived around 8am before it was too warm. There are several loops highly recommend you see them all. Lots of",

          "Every time we are in the Phoenix area we do these gardens, and each time we agree that it is a must do. These gardens can be on the pricey side but are well worth it. If you live in the area get a membership, if you live outside the area get a membership at a local botanical",

          "One of the best botanical gardens that I have visited in the U.S.! The grounds, the volunteers, the shops, the lay out, the trails, the exhibits, and the native plants were all amazing. You know you are in a good place when three beautiful Chihuly glass sculptures line the entry",

There are a few detractors starting with the very expensive entry cost, over $100 for two adults and three children. There were also a lot of plastic animals in bright colors. I thought these really ruined the natural beauty.",

          "Very stunning! I\u2019ve been to botanical gardens before but this was huge! I fell in love with cactuses after this for sure \ud83d\ude0d the whole garden is very well taken care of, clean and so so creative. Not only do they have plants but statues and \u2026",
          "Really enjoyed this botanica garden. There are a lot of different species and types of plants to look at. You walk about one and a half miles if you do the whole place. Beautiful scenery! It is located next to hole in the rock. So if you get a chance, head there afterwards. Friendly employees.",
          "Excellent Garden, many different types and colors. Good restaurant, two gift shops, one selling plants. Free parking. It's next to the Phoenix Zoo.",
          "Disappointing is what best summed up this visit. It is the day after Christmas during the day. It was busy, but managable. We have been here multiple times before, but the garden was worn out.  Very limited staff and almost no volunteers \u2026",
          "I went on free desert botanical garden days which was probably a big mistake because I was unable to meet up with my friends they had to limit attendance because so many people had come. I found the desert botanical gardens to be absolutely \u2026",
          "Luminarias event tonight was best ever in the past 4 years.  They toned down the wild & loud electric lights,  creating a more peaceful,  natural,  & calming experience. The native flutes, ethnic sounds,  and orchestral music played by multiple groups served to enhance and not detract from the beauty of the gardens.",
          "This was a great way to see what is native and grows really well in the area. What a ride variety, some we didn't expect. Very enjoyable",
          "Very beautiful gardens! Easy to walk pathways. Plenty of seating areas to rest as you stroll around the gardens.",
          "The Desert Botanical Gardens is well maintained. Has good signage for all the trails and exhibits. The Butterfly exhibition is the remarkable.",
          "Butterflies and snails and fish, oh my! The art installation right now is whimsical and lovely and the butterfly house was as lovely as always! This place is one of my top 5 places in Phoenix!",
          "This place is just unreal. I love coming here with a camera and spending a few hours enjoying all the work they put into making it a destination close to home.",
          "Love going to the garden.  Peaceful and beautiful.  Really enjoy the live concerts when offered.  Gertrudes restaurant at the garden is wonderful also..many garden fresh veggies incorporated in the dish.",
          "Went at dusk to dinner and the food was amazing. We then walked around the garden and everything was lit up and absolutely gorgeous! A great time spent!",
          "I loved it. Growing up in Chicago and seeing all the different kinds of AZ flowers and cactus was great.",
          "Very beautiful! A great Botanical garden.  Very informative and helpful volunteers to explain about the different plants and how they were used.  Worth a stop.",
          "Beautiful garden. The plastic animals are probably a highlight for children, a bit tacky for me. I enjoyed walking and photograph the bushes, cacti, birds. The Gertrude Restaurant was excellent!!",
          "Phoenix is fortunate to have such a gorgeous garden. We have been members for years and enjoy the classes, special events, and activities. First place we take guests to!",
          "Food, of course, is way over-priced, but the actual botanical gardens are simply incredible. As an arborist, I was stunned at the specimens. I came here to bring another arborist I know who loves succulents. They were floored and overwhelmed with the beauty and night time light show. Overall a wonderful experience.",
          "We went to Desert Botanical Gardens for attending the \u201c Butterfly Exhibition \u201c. More than thousands of butterflies to welcome us. Not only to realize the butterfly life cycle but also offer us an opportunity to observe their beauty in this very closer distance. Wonder experience and nice garden.",
          "Wow!  The crazy amount of plant life you never thought would be in the desert.  Amazing plants, hummingbirds, bees, Monarch Butterflies, so much to see.  An excellent way to spend the day.",
          "Really nice place to spend the day, or really an afternoon.  We went during a late morning through lunch and we're not disappointed.  I hear when lights are out at night it is even better but hard to believe when you see all the beautiful scenery during the day. Great place to visit during a weekend visit.",
          "Most of the paths are concrete or compact dirt. Take about 2 hours or so to do whole thing. The park entry fee was fairly overpriced for what we got. The place is primarily just different cacti.. I really wouldn't recommend unless you are into this type of thing.",
          "Beautiful all year round. Choose early morning hours in the warm months, but don't forget dusk and beyond. If you're from up North, remember spring flowers in the desert are in what you think of as winter.",
          "Husband and I visited on a Saturday from out of state. This is such a great tourist attraction. Very beautiful and relaxing. We got lots of awesome nature pictures. Love the educational aspect of it. However we found it to be a little pricey. I\u2019m glad we decided to go though.",
          "This is a favorite stop when we visit Phoenix.  It is beautifully maintained, diverse in its representation of desert flora and fauna, and the signage and docent presentations are very informative.   A great place to spend a few hours learning about the desert.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised with this botanical garden. It is a huge place that you can definitely spend a whole day at. It amazing how big some of the cactus gets. Also liked the butterfly garden and the other speciality gardens. There is so much to see you'll be glad you stopped to visit.",
          "A bit expensive. Plants are too close of each other to really make it feel like the desert. Lot of plastic modern art that clashes violently with the mood and ruin pictures and sights. Visited in 2h30. Free tours. Lot of water fountains. Some nice sights that are worth it.",
          "We loved the Botanical Gardens! Everything was beautiful, had great educational information, and was overall fun! There are water fountains and restrooms in many places throughout the gardens, which is great for out-of-towners like us who \u2026",
          "For one, I was disappointed because it was overpriced for what it was. Everything I saw in this garden, I have seen on hiking trails for free. The other thing that truly bothered me is everywhere in the park are these giant animal statues \u2026",
          "Lovely desert garden. We arrived at 3:20 PM and we're informed that they stop taking new visitors at 3 PM. That said, they allowed us to visit the gift shop, so we were able to view a small part of the garden. We plan to return at an earlier time.",
          "The Desert Botanical Garden is amazing! I could spend all day here! There was so much to see but I had so little time. The cactus ranged from tiny to HUGE. The flower path was so pretty and it was very relaxing to sit and enjoy nature. I highly recommend this place and will be back.",
          "What a magical desert garden!  Wonderful to see so many different desert plants all together, beautifully landscaped. Lunch at the botanical garden restaurant was delicious!",
          "Good place to check out as a tourist type of deal. I'd try to go when they have some event going on to maximize the value. Fun chill hiking in papago surrounding the area",
          "A little bit pricey but I understand why! They have to be able to afford to keep up with all of the exhibits and 100s of different types of cactus, flowers and everything else! As well as the events that they have year round! \n  It's \u2026",
          "We love this place. The events are amazing and the Desert Lights and Luminary event are truly magical. Just the way it feels when you walk the paths or sit for a moment and listen to soft Native American flute melodies is so refreshing. It encourages visitors to love the Desert even more",
          "Beautiful place. Butterfly garden was simply amazing. We were given butterflies that had just arrived via plane and were able to release them into the garden. Very cool experience! Will be back, that's for sure!",
          "So much diversity in this garden and I loved the tour (free!). Coming from Ohio where there's typical deciduous and coniferous vegetation, it was AMAZING to see these odd desert plants from around the world.",
          "Very interesting.  Beautiful grounds.  Thousands of desert plants.  Plan to spend at least a couple hours.",
          "I went to the Luminaria. The botanical garden is pretty interesting. They have a Cafe there and they serve alcohol. There's a gift shop. If you go to any special events there, I would advise securing tickets beforehand.",
          "Very beautiful, clean, and natural looking. Lots of good info throughout trails/paths! Highly recommend!!",
          "I never knew so many variety of different plants grew in a desert environment.\nWell laid out with plenty is signage. Paths were mostly paved and easy for walkers or wheel chairs.\nBeing from the Northeast this place was a serious eye opener.\nWorth many visits.",
          "The botanical garden well laid out with loops for different subject areas that bring you back to the main trail.  Plants are labeled and the guides are first rate.",
          "Absolutely stunning and so large! Great pathways for a stroller. Restrooms well dispersed and maintained. I learned so many things about cacti today. Would recommend that anyone in the area make a stop. It's $25 per person and free for active duty.",
          "Awesome in the winter. The animal statues are fantastic. My son absolutely adores the bears. It is a min adventure to find all of the animals amidst the cactus. \ud83c\udf35",
          "I love coming here.  It\u2019s free the second Tuesday of every month.  The variety of cacti, succulents and other plants is absolutely mind blowing.  You will see plenty of plants you never knew existed.  It\u2019s fairly sized so you can see \u2026",
          "Visited this place with my two adult sons, during a few hours on our own, while attending a convention. Beautiful place. Very peaceful.",
          "Visited twice for 4th grade field trips. Great experience on both occasions. Great lessons on the history of living in our desert environment.",
          "Wonderful experience in the desert.  Knowledgeable, friendly staff who make learning about desert life fantastic! Adults and kids live it!",
          "Absolutely beautiful, visually stunning and a very relaxed atmosphere. A place for every member of the family to enjoy.",
          "We enjoyed our time there very much. Being from the Midwest, we are unable to see the landscape, etc we saw while here. We were traveling with a 13 mth old and found the animal sculptures along the paths entertaining for her.",
          "The tour was great. The main reastraunt was the best deal well found in a week here with great service and excellent food....",
          "The grounds were kept clean. The ants were awesome! Loved seeing the desert plants",

          "The botanical garden is a beautiful place to visit. The garden has a wide variety of cacti, succulents, and other plants. Educational materials are placed along the trails and the gardens also have knowledgeable docents willing to answer \u2026",
          "Make sure to have comfy clothes and shoes and plenty of water as the walk in the summer can get tough.",
          "A beautiful place to spend the day. They have wonderful walking paths and host many fun events. They can be a little expensive, but it's a wonderful and educational experience.",
          "Fascinating and beautiful place. A LOT of cacti! Good bit of walking but lots to see.",
          "Really a wonderful experience. I'm not sure that the plastic animals did anything but detract from the natural beauty.",
          "This is such an awesome place. The desert plants are so beautiful and the gift shop has some really great stuff. The staff that work here are so helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in Scottsdale/Phoenix area.",
          "A surreal yet beautiful setting that uniquely captures the Arizona style. Rustic and whimsical!",
          "Spent couple of hours here, but the place is big so did not cover few spots. Plently of free parking available but it's always busy. They have guided tours. Entry fee is $25 for adults, feel it's a bit steep. They have huge variety of \u2026",
          "The gardens are decent enough with plenty to learn about if you're new to the area and not familiar with the desert. I would only recommend going on the free days.\n\nTheir plant sales are nice but unfortunately there are no returns as far as \u2026",
          "Beautiful botanical garden. We love the cactus and the displays. Some of the exhibits are wonderful.",

          "Well if you like cactus, this is the place for you. Plus the butterfly attracting plants smell so wonderful.",
          "The Botanical Garden is always good. So many events and nice people. All at your own speed. It is a delight for all ages and an expensive family outing. I see something new every time. The night time events are the best especially at Christmas.",
          "It was the best botanical gardens I have ever been to! The kids enjoyed it almost as much as I did .",
          "The Desert Botanical Garden has the most spectacular collection of mature cacti and succulents and is staffed by the most friendly people.

          "I am visiting from Canada and this is my second visit to the Desert Botanical Garden. I absolutely love it there. They have different themed walking \"loops\" to walk along. I love how they have a loop dedicated to the origibal Sonoran peoples. I love cacti and succulents so it is breathtaking to me.",
          "Absolutely beautiful, if you're in Phoenix don't miss this place! There's hours of educational walking trails and a crazy variety of desert plants. Totally worth the entrance fee.",
          "Night time in the garden with magical animals, luminaries, and trees wrapped with lights. January cool nights, lovely weather to stroll through the grounds. I go to the winter luminaries display every year",
          "Contains nearly all of the space plants from Transfold 57. A marvelled accomplishment at the time, we now of course have the ability to print whatever Transfold entities we need, even the far-flung outer banks of the universe that have \u2026",
          "Attended a wedding here and it was gorgeous. Beautiful grounds with lots of cool desert plants, interspersed with glass sculptures. The hills are lit up late at night and the cacti look so cool against the night sky. I can't wait to go back!",
          "Love this place.  Become a member and it's so worth it! Love the vegetable garden there",
          "Wonderful sights. Always something new to look at. A great place to visit during each season. Avoid the restaurant - unbelievably expensive.",
          "Awesome displays of cacti and description of plants and native animals. The staff is excellent with knowledge of the plants.",
          "Desert Botanical Garden is a must-see for visitors to Phoenix. There\u2019s a wonderful representation of desert flora that you may not have an opportunity to see if you don\u2019t happen to make it to the high desert or outskirts of Metro Phoenix. \u2026",
          "I highly recommend the Desert Botanical Garden! We happened to go on a free community day so there were quite a few people, but not too crowded. My husband and I covered all of the gardens and the off shoot trails. We learned so much about \u2026",

          "Who knew that cacti were so diverse and interesting? Not this East Coast visitor! The five grandkids enjoyed their scavenger hunt as we strolled through wide pathways. Water fountains, benches, native huts and integrated displays make this more than a 'walk in the park.'  Worth the entrance fee.",
          "Went to music in the garden. Always love the atmosphere. There is always dinner available right there. Good food, well worth it",
          "Who goes to Phoenix for vacation in August? Well, we did. One of the highlights was the flash light tour offered on Saturday evenings. We paid a discounted price, and enjoyed cooler weather, and some fantastic views of the garden. There was \u2026",
          "The desert botanical garden is very nice and there where a lot trails with great scenic views. The butterfly exhibit was nice and the light show was cool, but the music too loud (for me anyways) They were serving drinks and I think there was a gift shop. Bathrooms were clean and employees were nice.",
          "The garden is beautiful and an iconic place that\u2019s a must see if you live nearby or visit Phoenix!",
          "Absolutely beautiful! Amazing to see all the different desert flora, as well as squirrels, roadrunners and other critters that chose to live in the Gardens.",
          "I bet this place would look much nicer in the Spring. My husband and I unfortunately came during the winter and everything was blocked off. The cactuses were dying and there wasn\u2019t a lot to see due to private event and part of the garden \u2026",
          "Great place for whiever activity you'd like to do: a pleasant walk, sitting and reading, go on a gardening adventure. You pick, there's no miss with either of",
          "We have been coming here as members for 2 years. It's a lovely ambiance for an afternoon walk...open till 8pm and the sunsets are gorgeous when things are cooler...is hard to enjoy in the mid-day sun but Gertrude's has an assorted platter \u2026",

          "Loved it! So different than anywhere else in America for a Gardens.  Deserts are not like the rest of America.",
          "You dont get what you pay for.  Each ticket is $27, with no senior orveterans discount.  Nice leisure walk through various cactus.  Go to Boyce Thompson in Superior instead.",

          "We stopped by before our flight out of Phoenix and it did not disappoint! Great place to learn about the different plants and cacti found in different deserts. The butterfly sanctuary was pretty magical in itself!",
          "When my husband and I went, it happened to be a very rainy day. We had the whole place mostly to ourselves. It was magical with the little streams every where. We couldn't have had a better day!",
          "The garden is very beautiful! The illuminations display they have are fantastic. As the susets and the displays are lit it creates a serene atmosphere that is very soothing. A must see!",

          "Very nice place to visit Would recommend.",

          "I was originally scared by the $25 entrance fee (not common for other gardens I've been to) but ultimately I would say the price is worth it, and I'm very glad I went.

Those who contribute to the Garden know what they are doing, and they do it with class & competence.",
          "I love this place. It has been updated a lot. Most of the main trails are well maintained or paved with brick now. There are water fountains and restrooms enough for everyone now. My only wish is that there was more employees around to ask questions to without going on a tour.",

        "wiki": "The Phoenix Mountains Preserve (sometimes called the Phoenix Mountain Preserve) is a group of parks located among the Phoenix Mountains in Phoenix, Arizona, United States. The Phoenix Mountains Park and Recreation Area (better known as Piestewa Peak; formerly Squaw Peak), the first of these parks to be preserved, has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride.. Two of the parks rank among the world's largest city parks (along with McDowell Sonoran Preserve in Scottsdale, Arizona).The parks include:\n\nPiestewa Peak recreation area (formerly known as Squaw Peak; officially named the Phoenix Mountains Park and Recreation Area )Dreamy Draw Recreation Area, the trailhead and northern part of this parkCamelback Mountain Park\nPapago Park\nLookout Mountain Preserve\nNorth Mountain and Shaw Butte Preserves\nPhoenix Sonoran Preserve (under development)Additionally, South Mountain Park is sometimes included in this group.\nThese parks largely consist of small mountains and adjacent foothills that reach about 2,000 feet (roughly 600 meters) above the desert floor.  They also interrupt the checkerboard pattern of Phoenix's built environment and are quite prominent, especially since most of the city is flat and gridded.  Since the largest part of the Phoenix metropolitan area sits at just over 1,000 feet (around 300 meters) above sea level, that means most of the peaks reach about 3,000 feet (under 1,000 meters) above sea level.\nOriginally, the park system began with Piestewa Mountain Park and North Mountain Park as county parks.  However, most of the existing municipal park system was acquired in the early 1970s when Phoenix's ever-expanding development threatened to encroach on these mountainous areas.  All feature extensive hiking trails and many have public access areas with parking, ramadas (picnic tables) and restrooms.  Some offer nearby horse stables where horses can be rented and ridden into the park.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of historic properties in Phoenix, Arizona\nCave Creek Regional Park, a Maricopa County park\nLake Pleasant Regional Park, a Maricopa County park\nSpur Cross Ranch Conservation Area, a Maricopa County park\nUsery Mountain Park,  a Maricopa County park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoenix Mountain Parks/Preserves and Hiking Trails at City of Phoenix\nPhoenix Mountains Preservation Council\nMaps of the Phoenix Mountain Preserve\nLookout Mountain Park\nHistory of the Phoenix Mountains Preserve at Arizona State University",

          "Nice little hike. I did this because I didn't find out about Echo Canyon until I was in my hotel room that night. But it was enjoyable, great scenery, enough of those little educational placards to let you know what you were looking at. I liked Echo Canyon a lot better, but that",
          "This is a great alternative to attempting the hike up Camelback Mountain. You are able to drive up the super fun windy road right to the top for a stunning view of the whole valley and all the surrounding area. While we did not hike any of the trials we say many different",
          "I love this park. When you enter a trail, you leave the city behind. Walking trails have ranges of elevation gain to accommodate all levels of hikers. Equestrian and mountain biking is popular here too. I recommend researching South Mountain Park on the web to get general trail",
          "We set out at 7 a.m. in mid-April. The sun was already hot. We had chosen to walk the Javelina Canyon and Ridgeline trails, shown on Alltrails.com. It is marked on that site as 3.4 miles. On mapmywalk.com it turned out to be 4.1 miles. That extra distance could be a struggle for",

          "The view below was beautiful. However, the winding road to get to the top sucked. We had no idea it was that long or that winding. Our daughter got sick and puked in the van on the way up. The trails looked good for an armature, but not so much for young kids. Of course I was",

          "We had an afternoon in Phoenix before flying out the next day. Being outdoor people we looked for activity for hiking in the desert. What a gem this park is! The park staff were friendly and helpful with covering the most ground in a short time. Information on best views and",
          "We hiked 3 mountains while in Arizona including South Mountain. This was one of the busiest. The park is close to very populated areas and many of the trails are great for mountain bikes and running, so it draws a lot of traffic. If you are looking to hike there are some",
          "Very nice piece of wild nature right in the city. Easy drive to the top to see fantastic view of the city. I am not sure that hikes here are interesting since you are not going to see more that you saw from the car.",

          "We did the mormon trail to fat mans pass as well as the tunnel. A few times we thought we had strayed off the path, but seemed to still find our way! After hiking in other regional parks earlier in the week this was a nice surprise that there is no entrance fee! Also it is",

          "It is a long windy road to the top, but well worth it. Several spots to park and enjoy the views of Phoenix, Tempe and Mesa, as well as southern Arizona. Don't stay past dusk though because we saw a lot of hot rods, and young people zooming up the road to the top to party.",
          "The park is huge -- larger than Manhattan. The trails are well marked. The ranger at the welcome center was helpful in explaining the trails and helped us choose where to go.",
          "I wasn't too sure about this park because it doesn't really get any publicity that I ever saw. We heard about it from a local and we're so glad that we did! Nice vistas (even thought he view from the top was closed for some reason), but really enjoyable just driving through",
          "Very easy to get to, well labeled trails, easy hike/walk with great views. Purchased homemade jewelry in the parking lot.",
          "Before our ball game that afternoon at Tempe Diablo Stadium , we decided to check out the park. Parking lot small, they do have more parking along the road but get there early if you don't want to hike a mile to get to the trails. I wish we had more time to fully enjoy the",

          "Don't get me wrong, I love S Mountain Park. Three or four times I've flown to Phoenix to hike here. Nothing like sunny, 70 degree days in the desert when it's 25 in Colorado. But when you're out on the National trail for 8 hours, finding a restroom is a nightmare. Basically you",
          "This is a great place for a mellow hike. It\u2019s not too challenging unless you want to go to the top of the peaks. You can stay on a variety of trails and enjoy the cactus, wildflowers and beautiful views. Bring water and a hat you will be all set!",
          "Drive to Squaw Peak Road, and go to the top parking lot. From here, you can enter the park, and walk, hike, climb from dawn to dusk. It is quiet and tranquil, full of bird life, and beautiful views and vistas. All in the middle of the fifth largest city in America. There is",

          "Drove up Dobbins and Buena Vista lookouts and worth the drive. Its free and gives great views. Hiker's have a reason to visit also.",
          "South Mountain is actually a City of Phoenix Park, but if you are thinking swings and seesaws you will be sorely disappointed. If, instead, you are seeking myriad hiking trails of varying challenges, astounding city views, true desert landscapes, and knowledgeable park rangers,",
          "These mountains are huge even before you reach the base of them so I am happy I decided to just drive to the outlooks and not to hike there. The Visitors Center was manned by a nice lady who really knew the mountain and the surrounding areas very well. She gave great directions",
          "What a wonderful park so close to Phoenix. Blessed are the people in Phoenix to have access to mountains, hiking trails, and great look out views from this park. Hiking the Hidden Valley trail is not to be missed. So also a drive up to Dobbins Lookout to get fantastic views",
          "We always take new visitors to the valley here to view the sunset and the lights all over the valley. It has gotten busier over the years that we have taken folks there, so go up well before sunset to get a parking place. It is cooler and windier up on the mountain, so take a",
          "Best time to drive to and have a nice hiking is from early morning. Plenty of hiking trails and look outs, go to the summit, there is a nice view over looking the valley area. You may even see some animals. I have seen some wolfs.",
          "This huge park sits Southwest of Phoenix. It is a desert preserve surrounded by development. How wonderful that forward thinking citizens set this area apart. Nice visitors center. Many miles of trails. You will need to hike in the morning or in the evening to stay out of the",

          "I woke up at 4am my first night in Phoenix and searched for a place I could catch the sunrise. Thanks to the review from John H on here about visiting the South Mountain Park for this, he was right. View was great. You are allowed in the park well before sunrise so you can",
          "First of all could not find entrance. No signs. When found was closed for new entrance. Able to go around construction for hiking. Don\u2019t think we were on the right trail as we climbed a hill that was challenging in the heat. Good hike but not easy. Make sure you take water",
          "I was truly amazed at the peaceful quietness & cool shade ~ just beautiful views~ offered havin lunch up here, with a bunch of friends~ definitely would come back again!",
          "It was a long 3-4 hr hike but we enjoyed every step!!!!It is gorgeous!!!We saw ground squirrels and lizards everywhere and my kids had a blast and thats all that mattered to me!!!This is coming from someone who is Louisiana grown!!!",
          "Well, it is wild as can be behind a housing development. What I like about this place is, most anyone can hike the trails so - if you are a mountain goat like me you can scale trails to the top. If you just want to walk the somewhat wild desert, you can stay on the lower trails",
          "Love South Mountain for hiking! The trails are well marked, with just the right amount of hikers (not over crowded, like Camelback!). My husband and I love Morman Trail, Ridgeline and Holbert. There is a good mix of easy to difficult trails. Also, the drive to Bueno Vista",
          "My adult children took me to the top of this mountain at dusk just in time to see night lights of Phoenix. Curvy road, not too well lit rocky paths at park, but absolutely worth the trip, outstandingly beautiful view over the entire area!",

          "Follow signed to Buena Vista and park at the top of the hill (there are about 10 spots). Walk along the National Trail to the Hidden Valley Trail. Fat Man's Pass is just about 10 feet from the turn off. The hike had amazing views all along the trail. It is HOT in the summer,",

          "I love South Mountain Park! A beautiful desert oasis for hiking and viewing the city of Phoenix, as well as, the Ahwatukee Foothills. I frequently hike the mountain and enjoy the views and cardiac workout. We drive family up to the top for sunset views and have never been",
          "I drove up here after a day of meetings in Phoenix and was so impressed by the view. You really can't get a good sense for the expanse of the Phoenix area until you get up above it. The drive up among the saguaro cactus is lovely and there are many hiking trails and pull-off",
          "Take the time to visit this place at sunrise! Gorgeous! Take water and comfortable shoes. Enjoy the view and scenery. The splendour of the dessert!",
          "I spend a week in the Phoenix area every March. My mornings consist of 5-7 mile hikes and then a beer and baseball at the nearest stadium. This year's favorite spot was the Mormon Trail on South Mountain. The climb was every bit of moderate with some difficult spots and",

          "We organized a 10+ vintage car drive for friends and went up to the top of South Mountain. I've lived here since the 60's and haven't been there in at least 40 years. Most of our friends have never been there. It was gorgeous. You don't have to hike - just get out of the car",
          "From the first parking lot (take a right from the main entrance), looking north down Central Ave will have great views of Phoenix. Heading south will provide a rugged view with cacti and trails.",
          "What a great place to visit. Easy to fine and the roads are well marked. We drove to the summit and there was lots of parking. Some people may find the drive a bit nerving as the road is narrow, curvy and in some place there are no guard rails. However, the speed limit is slow",
          "This is a nice park to spend the day at as long as it is not too hot! We stopped by only for a few minutes because the cacti and mountain s caught our eye! My brother often takes bike rides through the park when the weather is cooler and never tires of this park and its views!",
          "It was a very hot day when we decided to visit, so we drove to the vista, rather than hiking there but either way you'll be rewarded with a breathtaking view. It's very easy to drive to and is free to get in which is a bonus and if you love cactus you certainly won't be",
          "South Mountain was always my go-to hike when living in Arizona. I loved the Beverly Canyon trail and the Ridge Line trail as well. I probably hiked most of the mountain during my seven years living there and it is beautiful and quiet depending on the time of year you choose to",
          "This is a great day trip or for just a couple of hours. The views of the valley and Phoenix are really cool! Lots of cactus and other desert \ud83c\udf35 plants. The park is free and there are restrooms at the Ranger station and an outhouse at Dobbins Lookout. There is also a covered",
          "If you want a nice little adventure I suggest you try hiking South Mountain. It's a great place to take in the desert for a nice little nature hike or even ride your mountain bike on some challenging trails. Don't forget to drink your water! I would also suggest to visit",
          "My husband and I were touring the Phoenix area. He especially loves the mountains. So we took a drive here. First we stopped in the visitor center and then drove all the way to the vista. Definitely worthwhile and it is FREE admission. Can't beat that. For those more active",
          "South Mountain is fantastic! We hike and look for scorpions every time we visit! The view from the top is gorgeous! Try to go up right before dusk, so you can see the city at night!",
          "We have hiked in South Mountain Park several times and it is remarkable to have such a beautiful park so close to the city. The trails are very nice and not too crowded. Summer is not the best time to go here due to the heat. The crowds pick up in fall, winter and spring. There",
          "We have been at South Mountain Park several times. We almost always bring out of town visiters to the top for the view. I would pick a day with very clear skies. The fall and winter months are the best times.",
          "Watch out for the mountain bikes along the trail. Step to the side when you see them coming. Otherwise, this is a challenging hike. It is a well traveled path. Nice view at the top of Phoenix, Arizona.",
          "We were in Phoenix for a convention and decided that we wanted to do something \"touristy,\" but it was too late in the day to go to the museums in downtown Phoenix, so we decided to go to South Mountain Park. We are glad that we did. We got some good saguaro cacti pictures, as",
          "If you like to run bike or hike this is a great option for you, some friends or family. Your options range from easy trails to more challenging ones. Truly beautiful views, photo opportunities and a unforgettable view of the valley.",
          "Awesome in winter/spring, especially after rains. It's free and there are many trails you can choose from/combine. My favorite so far is the Fat Man's Pass/Hidden Valley loop. Do not go in the summer unless you're well acclimatized, carrying plenty of water, and can finish",
          "In the fall, spring and winter, this big city park has lots of exercise options from hiking, running, biking and awesome scenic views of downtown and the surrounding valey.",
          "This was probably the best spot in Phoenix we went to for photo opportunities. You get a very good view of the valley from the top. The drive up to the top isn't bad at all either. You'll have to take it easy as the roads are small and curvy but it's only a solid 10-15 minutes.",
          "It was the last day of our most recent visit to the southwest. After a beautiful, but hot visit to the Botanical Garden, we decided to do something involving a bit less hiking. Taking a drive up to Dobbins Lookout seemed ideal, and we're glad we did it. The drive to the top is a",
          "We drove to one of the lookout points near the top of the mountain. We caught an amazing sunset over the desert and downtown phoenix. Plus... IT'S FREE!",
          "We took the boat cruise and it was super informative and neat! We saw big horn sheep, wild stallions, and lots of birds. The bloody mary was delish too!",
          "South Mountain Park is a overlooked jewel in the rough \u2013I am amazed how many people live in the Phoenix area or have visited here and don\u2019t know that the WORLDS largest city park is right here in their back yard. The park is around 17,000 acres. From a distance or driving to",
          "Just think of it: from downtown Phoenix, enormous beyond belief, drive laser-straight across one of the widest dry rivers you'll ever want to see and right up into the rock face of these foreboding-looking mountains. This is the Sonoran desert, to be sure, and you can wind and",
          "I am as close to a native as possible and have been going to South Mountain park since I was a child. Great views of the city, day and night. June, July and August are very hot in the valley, if you are not use to the heat a sunset run up the mountain may be best. Winter months",
          "we did not hike; just drove to the top and walked around. various levels of benches to sit and enjoy the view. plenty of saguaro cactus to photograph. well-paved roads. not much traffic, easy to navigate.",
          "We hiked to \"Hidden Valley\" in May of 2017. Although it was pretty hot, even by 8am, the views were amazing. The trails were fairly well maintaned and there were different levels of difficulty for people of varying abilities.",
          "many different paths with different levels of comfort. Take water, wear sunscreen and watch out for snakes from June onward.",
          "Not too much into hiking, but easier trails suitable for walking are available. In any case the views are nice and picturesque.",
          "There are different trails. My favorite is Hidden Valley. It is incredible! There are some trails with petroglifos. Always be in the trail! Spring is my favorite time to visit",
          "This short drive from Downtown takes you to a mountain top with wild scenery and a view of Phoenix downtown and surrounding districts. This trip out is definitely worth the short drive.",
          "South Mountain Park overlooks Phoenix - beautiful lights after sunset. The park has a long drive up to the top. There are a lot of covered stone barbeques for large gatherings and trails for hiking (take water!).",
          "In desperate need of outdoor time after a day or two of working in an office, I decided to check out South Mountain. I'm pretty sure I hiked the Mormon Trail, which was very easy, and provided a good perspective of the entire valley and surrounding area. I'm certain it's much",
          "Loved Phoenix and loved the desert! Esp the cactus. They are so majestic and amazing. Lovely scenery and people!",
          "Park was in good shape. Nice view of the phoenix area. Lots of desert plants Roads well kept how ever very winding",

          "While passing through Phoenix, we took a little time to drive the 35 miles to Dobbins Lookout in this park. A few spots in the drive had slow speed turns, but manageable. Very nice spot on the top for viewing the City of Phoenix and relaxing.",
          "Take a day trip and explore South Moutain Park. Once your drive up the winding road, the view from the tops is spectacular!",
          "My sister and I drove up to Dobbins Point at dawn on a Sunday morning. When we arrived just minutes after the sunrise, a radio was blaring from an open car, it sounded like full volume. It was so loud it was hard to tell what kind of \"music\" it was. We walked around for a few",
          "We enjoyed watching an April sunset here on a weekend trip to Scottsdale. Having grown up in the valley, this was one spot I had never visited. We went based on a tip from a local friend, and we were not disappointed. Once you drive through the not so nice part of Phoenix,",
          "Great trails. Not much parking. From the parking lot, it's all uphill. Take more water than you think you will need.",
          "It was a clear day and the views of Phoenix city below were simply spectacular. We drove up the mountain, as were pressed for time. My only regret is that we didn't have more time to explore the park, or to climb up or down. The bright side? Lots of fun left for future visits.",
          "Nice place to visit. Very clean park. Views were amazing. I definitely will visit again. Very enjoyable.",
          "We had a nice time, the park itself was beautiful. Wish we had come on a different day, on Sundays they close the drive route to the summit for bikers only and we didn't have time for the hike. We walked around the visitor center where there were sidewalk paths but didn't get",
          "I had a great time at South Mountain seeing the exquisite views. The climb up is breath-taking---------this is by car. My host was very familiar with the area and pointed out various venues. I heartily recommend the Park to all who are in the Phoenix vicinity.",
          "We've been up to the top of the mountain several times and never tire of it. We've been fortunate in going when it wasn't very crowded. I highly recommend picking a time when the crowds are low. The drive up is great - a winding road climbing up the side of the mountain. At",

          "I did a cancer walk here last year and it was the most beautiful view when you get to the top of Phoenix City! Killed me on the way up, but I made it!",
          "Brought the kids (10 and 7) to Arizona and hadn't planned on all the hiking we ended up doing. The kids loved it, we loved it. The views were amazing. We choose a path that wasn't too challenging, but still a great workout. I cannot recall which one, but we picked it based",
          "The park can be quite beautiful and you do get good views to Phoenix and the south. It also has the benefit of being able to drive to the summit. It is howver not as good an experience as Camelback or McDowell's but worth a visit.",
          "This place is a great spot to see the beautiful Phoenix skyline. Many easy hiking trails and lots of beauty.",
          "We went there on our last day to while away the time before going to the airport. We drove up to the summit and enjoyed a great view over the phoenix area. The hiking trails were, well, not busy as such, but we saw hikers on almost all of them but it wasnot crowded.",

          "Loved going to the top of South Mountain Park since first moving to Arizona in 1956. Still thrills me to go there for picnics and reunion gatherings. We used to go there to watch the planes land at Sky Harbor Airport, but back then there was only one terminal. Well maintained",
          "We enjoyed our time here. The views are beautiful and we did some day hiking. It wasn't far from our hotel so that was nice. There are several lookout points with great views.",
          "This is a great place to hike the trails vary in difficulty but you will find one that suits your ability for sure. You can drive to the top if you like and hike across the entire length or start from the bottom on ant of three sides. This is a large mountain with lots of desert",

          "South Mountain is a hop, skip, and jump from downtown Phoenix. Overall, the views were fascinating, especially as the clouds lifted from the distant mountains. It's worth a morning of hiking and scenic views of Phoenix and the surroundings. Bring your camera and click away at",
          "We went early in the morning, which I would recommend! It was cool and not very crowded. We hiked the Mormon Trail (very well marked) and continued on to the Hidden Valley Trail to see the Fat Man's Pass and Tunnel (not so well marked). Took us about 2.5-3 hours to hike,",
          "Follow the trails, and there are many, take water and remember it gets hot out there. Cell phones do work so if you have issues call for help.",
          "This is an awesome place to get nearly a 360 degree view of the entire valley, and the best part is, you can drive to the vista points! We drove to both Buena Vista & \"TV Tower\" view points, and hiked part of the National Trail at Buena Vista. The trail is fairly flat, and has",
          "It's an easy drive down Central Avenue up to the top of South Mountain. Plenty of parking, trails, and vistas await. It is really a must to go there just to see the city of Pheonix from such a lofty position.",

          "It was worth the drive up the side of South Mountain for the view and I'm glad we went. The facilities on the top of mountain are modest and the area for viewing requires you to be somewhat careful walking about.",
          "I recently got back from spending a few incredible days in Arizona exploring the Phoenix area with my niece Alex. While we were there, we were able to visit beautiful South Mountain Park. Apparently it is the largest municipal park in the United States, and is one of the largest",

          "We loved this set of trails. Well-maintained and well-marked. They have trails for all types of walkers. We did the Pima Wash and Ridgeline Trails - a circular loop of about 3 miles (5 km). The Ridgeline trail involves some elevation gain but the views of Phx from the tops are",
          "We hiked the Holbert Trail. About 4 miles round trip. Moderate hike, few steep places, yet lots of switchbacks to lessen the grade. Bathrooms at the bottom of the trail, and at the top of the trail. You can drive to the summit, but why would you, hiking is much more fun.",

          "It is a great place to get in some excercise.",
          "The recent rains have made the canyon through which the Geronimo Trail winds lush and verdant. Wildflowers were popping ahead of the coming spring warm-up.

          "Growing up in Phoenix Arizona this is always one of my favorite spots to return to. One of the first places I took my wife once I took her home to meet my family.

          "In my opinion, this is the best place in the Phoenix area for road cycling climbs. Lots of paved roads and traffic is usually easy to deal with because of the curves and switch backs. Many Sundays are no cars past the 1 mile marker which is even better. Great metro park!",

          "Love the view! Great hike!",
          "The city of Phoenix has hit and miss pollution haziness, but on a bright and sunny day, this spot is a fantastic place to catch a view of the city. If you\u2019re into biking there are plenty of windy turns which make this a pleasure to ride down.",

          "One of the best parks I've ever been to, I have very good experiences coming here. The area was so wide you can feel the nature around you.

          "Great place to hike. Also pretty bad after the sun goes down, you can see everything. I suggest binoculars. When I was a kid there was a car hanging off the side of the mountain when my mom was driving up. It was pretty crazy. Great place to clear your head, when the temps are cooler of course.",

          "Hiked from the top parking lot to Fat Man's Pass. The hike was billed as \"moderate difficulty\" but it was really quite mellow. Be aware that, aside from occasional trail markers, there is not a lot of direction given out on the trail. Best to bring a map from the visitor center.",

          "It is a beautiful, beautiful park. Hiking and (awesome) mountain biking Trails are well marked. More biodiversity than you would expect in the desert. Saw birds, exotic insects, and even a juvenile Gila Monster (from a distance!). I recommend insect repellant for flies, and wearing long socks.",
          "Great morning run. Sunrise was fantastic.",
          "What was a HUGE drawback is it was a struggle to find any signs or maps or notices or plaques that gave the history & its significance. Building remains are in good condition. Great location for photography. Very easily accessible (easy in/out).",
          "Awesome place to explore but please do so carefully and at your own risk.",

If you do not arrive early, be prepared to park far from your trailhead and get a \"warm up hike\" before you start your actual hike. These trails also allow bikes so just be prepared to move to let them pass.",

        "wiki": "Papago Park  is a municipal park of the cities of Phoenix and Tempe, Arizona, United States. It has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride.\nIt includes Hunt's Tomb, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nPapago Park is a hilly desert park covering 1200 acres in its Phoenix extent and 296 acres in its Tempe extent. Tempe refers to its section of the park specifically as Tempe Papago Park.\nPapago Park is notable for its many distinctive geological formations and its wide variety of typical desert plants, including the giant saguaro cactus. The park also features the Desert Botanical Garden, a large zoo (the Phoenix Zoo), picnic areas, several small lakes, hiking trails, bicycle paths, a fire museum, and Hunt's Tomb, the pyramidal tomb of Arizona's first governor, George W. P. Hunt. Tempe Papago Park includes baseball and softball fields, picnic ramadas, a small lake, and other features. Rolling Hills Golf Course is within the park between its Phoenix and Tempe extremities.The park includes the home baseball and softball stadium for North Pointe Preparatory.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe distinctive red sandstone geological formations of Papago Park were formed some 6-15 million years ago. One such formation, Hole-in-the-Rock, is a major landmark, thanks to the openings (tafoni) eroded in the formation over time. There is some evidence that the Hohokam\u2014a now-extinct aboriginal tribe that once lived in the Phoenix area\u2014used the openings and sunlight to track the solstices.\nThere are also some signs of Precambrian granite in the park.  The bedrock is concealed by only a thin layer of topsoil.\nPapago Park was designated a reservation for the local Maricopa and Pima tribes of aboriginal Americans in 1879.  It became the Papago-Saguaro National Monument in 1914, but this status was recalled by Congress, April 7, 1930, because the area was not considered suitable for a national monument. It was divided amongst the state of Arizona, the city of Tempe and the Water Users Association, later known as the Salt River Project. The Federal government reserved all oil, coal or other mineral rights.Following the onset of the Great Depression, Governor Hunt commissioned a bass fish hatchery to be established in Papago Park during 1932. The hatchery was built as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project, and became successful, stocking largemouth bass and other fish for Arizona's waterways.\nDuring World War II, Papago Park housed a POW camp and contained as many as 3,100 prisoners from 1942 to 1944.  It was also the site of the largest mass escape from any United States prison camp in World War II.  The Great Papago Escape occurred on December 23, 1944 when 25 prisoners, including German U-boat commander J\u00fcrgen Wattenberg, escaped the camp using a 178-foot tunnel and made their way to the Arizona desert.  Many prisoners quickly realized that they knew nothing about the landscape or climate and turned themselves back in. Wattenberg was the last to be captured, on January 28, 1945.After the war the POW camp site served as a VA hospital from 1947 to 1951, then an Army Reserve facility.\nThe state-owned portion of Papago Park was sold to the city of Phoenix on February 25, 1959. The fish hatchery was also shut down in 1959, as it was considered obsolete by that time.\nThe City of Phoenix leased the hatchery grounds, including its man-made lakes, to the Arizona Zoological Society in 1962 to establish the Phoenix Zoo. A small stone cottage, used as the hatchery caretaker's residence, was retained as part of the zoo, and extensively renovated in the 1990s.\nA portion of the Tempe park was conveyed to that city in 1935, and a parcel within that portion was conveyed to the Salt River Project in 1955. An 18-hole championship golf course was built by the city of Phoenix and completed in 1963.\nThe park was also the Finish Line in the fourth season of The Amazing Race.\n\n\n== Hunt's Tomb ==\nHunt's Tomb is a small white pyramid behind a fence at the top of a hill within  Papago Park. George W.P. Hunt (Arizona's 1st governor) had the tomb built in 1931 to entomb his wife. He was placed there after his death in 1934. Their daughter and his wife's family are also buried there.\n\n\n== Papago Ponds ==\nThe Ponds have a surface area of 6 acres (2.4 ha) with an average depth of 8 ft (2.4 m), the elevation of the area is 1,100 ft (340 m).\n\n\n=== Fish species ===\nRainbow trout\nLargemouth bass\nSunfish\nChannel catfish\nTilapia\nCarp\n\n\n=== Other species living at Papago Ponds ===\nWoodhouse's toad\nMexican free-tailed bat\nRed-eared slider turtle\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPhoenix Historic Property Register\n\n\n== References ==\n\nInformation and Education Division (2007). \"Arizona Fishin' Holes\".

Great place to have a picnic or just a great spot for lunch. You can also check out the hole in the rock which is just down the road here. Overall great tourist spot",

          "This is an easy little hike, but that does NOT mean it poses no danger. My wife and I thought we\u2019d stop by here for a few minutes and go up to the hole. Simple enough, not a bad view, but coming back down.....there\u2019s a tiny rock face section - not steep at all - but even with",

          "I stayed near Papago Park. I walked over, through the park on the trails, and then did the hike up to Hole in the Rock. It was a fairly easy climb and the view was fantastic. I then walked down the other side and it afforded gorgeous views of the park landscape. Definitely",

It was on President\u2019s Day so I\u2019m not sure if the holiday was why it was so crowded on a Monday, but lots of people there to see the neat natural formation. About impossible to get a picture in the hole without others",

          "This park is right in the middle of Phoenix,Scottsdale and Tempe. It looks like an impossible climb but there are steps cut in around the back side that make it an easy walk up to the hole. Once you get there, the view is amazing. Not to be missed.",
          "Great spot for sunset photos, but too many people there then. A quick hike up, thrkugh the hole and plenty of room fkr shots of sunset, if you can find a place to stand! The llace was full of people, couples, photographers, teens, and even younger children.",

          "We\u2019ve spent many years visiting Scottsdale area but never climbed Hole in the Rock. It was a wonderful experience with the 10 of us ranging from 5-68 years. It\u2019s a short hike with a slight incline. You are walking on clay-like surface with bits of rock embedded. Walking",
          "We took other travelers' advice and went at sunset. It was crowded but we had plenty of room to take beautiful photos and see the view. We walked around the entire rock with ease. We climbed up on the front side and sat there alone to watch the sunset. Nice little touresty stop",

          "We walked up to the hole in the rock in less than 10 minutes (it was 104 degrees, so we were glad it was short). Stayed there for several pictures and time for reflection. It was actually cooler in the rock due to breezes coming through the opening. It's right next door to",

          "This is a really neat view. When you enter the park, go the to zoo and turn left, this road will take you to the parking lot just below the Hole in the Rock. It is a circular trail that goes behind the rock and brings you up in back. It really is only a 5 minute walk. There",

          "We were looking for something to do while coming through Phoenix heading west to California. We stoped here and enjoyed our time at the hole in the rock. If you have a large vehicle with a trailer you should park in the Zoo parking lot near the rock and walk to the Rock. It\u2019s a",
          "Hot! But since it only takes 30-45 minutes I didn\u2019t really mind going mid day. Does take a little physical exertion but most children could do it. Elderly may have trouble. Nice view.

          "If you're looking for a photo spot to highlight Arizona this is the place to be. The view is amazing and the hike is easy. Bring plenty of water, and I don't recommend the hike in summer months. Summer months are not for people unfamiliar with Arizona's heat, even with the",
          "We visited with our four children, between the ages of 7 and 11. The climb up the mountain was fun and easy for the kids. We even saw, what we think, was a Chuckwalla lizard! The view from the top was amazing! There were many people going up and down the mountain, not crowded",
          "It is a very short hike (<5 min) to reach the hole in the rock which is a fun and different type of rock formation! Free parking and the view make this an easy decision to visit",
          "Teens and grandma enjoyed the small hike and view from the Hole in the Rock. It was busy, but everyone shared space in the hole itself.",
          "It is worth it just for the view, however it is just a hole in a rock. The climb it easy, so family friendly",
          "It's an easy hike for most people. It was manageable for me and my bad knee. It's about the only \"hike\" that's doable. There are steps around the back. Takes about 10 minutes to walk up. It's a little on the steep side, but lots of fun.",
          "Very easy hike. Other people made it seem like it wasn't easy but I saw a disabled woman on the hike and my 80 year old mother went with me. Don't fear the hole. Great view, worth every step.",
          "We had an 8 hour layover and took Uber to the Rock for a \"desert fix\". Met our needs to climb a few rocks, take some pictures next to giant cactus and relax at the park an hour or so. We then took Uber to Tempe for lunch and back to the airport. Definitely worth it and ubers",
          "During peak hours (around 10a - 3p) parking can be difficult. You may need to park some distance away then walk. But, the walk is easy and comfortable, and the short 3-5 minute hike to the top is easy enough for children to ascend. Once there you'll be rewarded with a nice view!",
          "It is crowded usually, but there is a hole in the rock as advertised. There is a short hike around the back-side of the hole to make it a more interesting visit.",
          "This is a short 15 - 20 minute hike to the hole within the rock. It's not terribly steep so you can take younger kids. It's a great view once you get there. I recommend it if you just have some time to kill.",
          "If you\u2019re looking to get outdoors and take in some Arizona scenery but aren\u2019t big into hiking, this is the spot for you. The hike to the top of the rock is maybe 10 minutes from the parking lot. The path is clearly marked and safe to travel on. The views you\u2019ll have from the top",
          "This is a great place to just pop around quick before the zoo is it\u2019s so close. A very easy hike not a lot of vertical until you actually get up to the hole And there are several trails around that lead off but mostly level ground. If you\u2019re thinking of going someplace that\u2019s a",
          "Fun little easy hike up to the hole. Great views and pix from the top. Also see the ponds that are like oasis in the desert. Nice park close in to Phoenix. Check out the pyramid in the park. Views of the zoo from the top.",
          "My husband and I both agreed this hike was one of the best parts of our annual trip to AZ. Located right in Phoenix, this beautiful rock wasn't difficult to reach. There were hikers as young as 5 and over 60 years old and everyone was happy!! Bring water. There is plenty of",
          "A nice little stop if you have time to kill before your flight or if you are visiting the botanical gardens/zoo. Not worth a trip specifically for it, but decent as an added activity. Easy climb up and could be great for little ones, but it gets crowded.",
          "Given all the other incredibly hiking opportunities in this area, I give this a 3 because of it's simple level of difficulty and distance, but it's still a neato spot for a quick stop on the way to the airport to say goodbye to the area. Nice views, super easy, interesting",
          "This is a great place to view east and west of Phoenix. Located right beside the zoo. Take 30 minutes, very easy climb (no handicap friendly). Climb through the hole and have a seat and enjoy the view. Rocks can be a little slick.",
          "If you are near, stop by and take a photo. It's a quick stop, but I promise you it makes a cool shot for your family and friends to enjoy. Super easy walk up to \"The Hole.\" Unique and different. Not too busy on the weekdays...should't have to wait for a photo opportunity.",
          "Heard about the place so I wanted to see it for myself. There was lots of people there the day I visited, so I was not able to get a clean photo without others in the shot. The hole itself was full off fellow visitors. Its an easy walk and a very short hike to the top. Anyone",
          "Worth a drop by if nearby. Fifteen minute (or less) easy walk/climb to the top. Fun to look through the hole that nature created long ago.",
          "Very pretty rock structure. Not a hike, you walk up a trail to the hole a very short ways, so if you are older or have difficulty walking, I believe you can still get there with no problem.",
          "We went on a weekday (highly recommended) versus a weekend and pretty much had the rock/scenes to ourselves. People came and go but taking a picture in the hole (where you enter and exit) wasn\u2019t a problem with no one in the way. Easy, great views of the city and relaxing. Best",
          "Unique tourist spot in the heart of the city. Free parking, short hike up to the hole in the rock for a great view and photo oportunity. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this spot, but if nearby definitely worth stopping.",
          "A beautiful spot in Papago Park. We decided to go check this out before going to the airport, as it was nearby, and so glad we did! The area is beautiful, there is an oasis next to it. The hike up to the hole in the wall is short, less than 15 minutes walk. There are a couple",
          "Fun and easy hike to see a great natural rock formation. Takes an hour or less, great views! Parking is a bit tricky but you can use the nearby Zoo parking if you don't mind walking a bit.",
          "Neat, quick spot to check out as you check off your list of things to easily do while in Phoenix. Easy hike and lots of opportunities to snap pictures from different areas, as you make your way up to the main attraction. It's free! The pictures attached are a morning visit -",
          "This was a nice low impact hike that my wife and I took last time we were in Phoenix. There\u2019s some nice views when you get to the top. It is close to the zoo too.",
          "Papago Park is a great spot to get out and feel like your not locked up in the city. This is an easy little walk from the parking lot to get up to the hole in the rock. It's usually pretty busy but a fun way to see a little more of Tempe. It's also right next the zoo if your",
          "Try it you will feel like you can do more than people think you can- I\u2019m quite out of shape & was able to make this small climb & then we enjoyed the \u201coasis\u201d for a while- this is a free activity & located next to the zoo if you want to do a little more",
          "This hike is relatively easy for most folks, but not those who have mobility issues. Once there you can see the beautiful vistas of the Valley of the Sun.",
          "This is a fairly easy hike...lots of loose rock so wear walking shoes!! The view is very nice. We missed sunset but that would be gorgeous!",
          "We were at the zoo and saw this, but didn't have time to hike to it that day. Which ended up being a good thing as we could see there were a ton of people on it. Ended up going later in the week early and it was much better, Parked right in front of the trail head signs, which",
          "This was a neat place to see. It is near the zoo and part of popago park. There is a bike area here and a few trails but the main attraction is the rock. It is very busy especially at sunset.",
          "This was an easy walk and a nice way to get a skyline view of Phoenix. In addition, there are picnic areas and trails surrounding the rock, so you could spend an afternoon walking and taking in some nature. Makes for a nice and easy day. However, I won't expect much shade on",
          "Easy climb and lovely views. 30 mins is all you need. Had never seen a chipmunk so that was cool, he was friendly.",
          "From the parking area, this looks just like the pictures. The trail to the attraction winds around the back and there is where the impressive view is appreciated. Also read the placards before you go up. You can walk through the hole and enjoy the vista view of the lake and",
          "We had been looking forward to this hike, and easily found directions to get there. Parked, checked out the map, and set out following the 5K signs. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, we missed how you get up to the hole in the rock safely. We saw people walking off",
          "This is a short and easy walk/hike to see hole in the rock and see nice view. A lot of people make it difficult to make pictures so come early.",
          "This is a great stop if you are in the area for other activities. When looking at the rock from the lot, follow the path to the right that goes behind to hike up. Quick stop and a short hike with beautiful views.",
          "We had the good fortune to hike in Papago Park on a sunny, warm day and enjoyed the geological sights tremendously. Every angle showed you something a little different. We took the longer walk which took us around all the hill formations; at times you wonder how the whole",
          "This was a fun stop to make while hitting the trails we wanted to see in the Phoenix area. Very easy to get up to the hole, and it made us curious about climbing other rock formations in the distance. With one member of our group with a bad knee, we were looking for easy",
          "I was in Phoenix, AZ for a work conference and my co worker and I decided to take a day trip out here to fill the afternoon. I think the drive took about 15 min from the downtown area via Uber. There was a bit of a hike to the top but the views were great! The area around it is",
          "As this was right off the road, and a quick walk from the car, we planned a quick stop on our way to a spring training game. Although the butte was very cool, we were a bit disappointing at the condition of the trails as they were littered with trash, bottles, and such.",
          "We did this hike with our 12 and 9 year old. Very easy hike and good views from the top. The hike up eve back had rock stairs and maybe took 5 minutes.",
          "After a day at the zoo we popped over to climb up to have a peek through the hole in the rock! It is right next to the zoo so be sure to check it out! It\u2019s a easy trail up around the back of the rock. Our family enjoyed checking this out while visiting the city. We were in",
          "my husband climbed the rock and got some great photos. He said there were some cool hieroglyphics in the hole and there was a park employee to assist people with questions, etc. There are restroom facilities, picnic tables, etc. Nice park",
          "As this was a must do in Tempe from TripAdvisor, and less than 15 minutes from our airport hotel, we decided to take a drive and do the short hike. For a Monday morning in early March, we were surprised at the number of visitors to these Rocks. There were enough parking spaces",
          "When we were younger we did the more intense climbs in Phoenix. Now we are in our 70's and our grandsons are young . This was a great easy climb. The first time our grandson climbed it he was 4 and it was a little intimidating but holding grandmas hand he made it. Now he is 6",
          "This formation is definitely worth visiting. It\u2019s a nice little hike up and is family friendly. We saw lots of children of all ages climbing at their comfort level as well as experienced adult climbers climbing on the very top of the rock. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it",
          "Pretty cool to see. Takes 2 minutes to walk up and back down. It is very small compared to the picture.",
          "Living in an urban city on the east coast, there are many man made structures that are pleasing to the eye. However, the western horizons and mountain formations are truley amazing. While it was chilly and raining a bit when we visited this very interesting formation, it was",
          "Nice family activity for all ages. Ample parking, the park entrance and parking are free. The trail is easy, but it can get crowded.",
          "Just a quick little climb up to the hole from the parking lot. Not a fabulous view from the top , but is cool to see the rock formations.",
          "Don't know how I missed this the last time I was in Phoenix, but it's definitely an easy hike and the view is outstanding. Parking is easy, right next to the trail. It takes about ten minutes at the most to walk around to the back side and up into the hole. Make sure you have",
          "My Grandkids wanted to hike up a mountain while they were here and this was perfect, after our day at the zoo. Beautiful views once you are at the top.",
          "This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix. Its right by the Phoenix Zoo and its a great place to go have a picnic, hiking or just go see a spectacular view. If your looking for a place to be alone then this isnt your place. Somebody is always there and usually its a",
          "I randomly searched free things to do in Phoenix and this popped up. My friend and I were visiting and we went and we had fun taking pictures. It was a quick hike to the top and we got some good photos.",
          "Takes only 5-10 minutes to hike up there and it is such a fun little photo op. The views are pretty cool as well. Whoever named this place was super creative.",
          "Based on reviews, we attempted this hike with or one year old in a backpack carrier. She loved it. Some adventurous souls went up the front, but we were please with the level of difficulty around the side and back. The step-like terrain was relatively easy to navigate even with",
          "Stopped by for sunset views with the family :) breathtaking sights. Can be dangerous as the rocks are smooth and steep, so if not careful you can slip off to your death.",
          "We had no idea this would be so fun. It\u2019s an easy hike up the mountain (trails) and it was really awesome at the hole in the rock.",
          "This is a great site for a short visit, and easy to get to. It\u2019s right next to the Phoenix Zoo, and a short climb to the top. It will be crowded at sunset, but still enjoyable. Wear hiking shoes or tennis shoes so you can walk around comfortably.",
          "We enjoyed a 1-hour walk on the paved Elliot Ramada Loop trail following a visit to the nearby Az Historical Society Museum. Parking was free and easy to access. Views of the rocks and park terrain varied as we followed the loop. We saw people climbing the rocks for a little",
          "This is an interesting rock bordering the Phoenix Zoo property. It has a hike around the back that most people can do at their own speed. It is not handicap accessible except to the parking lot in front of it. Views of Phoenix are great from the top.",
          "There is a marked trail to climb up to hole in the rock. On the back side are long stairs going up. Terrain can be rocky but this climb is not too challenging. It is worth the climb for the views. Sunsets here are pretty cool!",
          "I grew up near this, and it is a place most kids in the area have visited. It has even been in at least a few movies. The walk up can be a little difficult, but not too bad.",
          "Easy walk (hike) up the back side and you reach the hole in the rock. Cute stop in the middle of the city.",
          "This place is like Art. It's natural formation of holes in a massive \"rock\" is so much fun exploring!",
          "Beautiful view of the city and great outdoors. Parking can be tough but manageable. Bring water as resources are limited.",
          "This was a quick stop while in Phoenix. It was neat but absolutely packed with school groups. It was unnerving having a lot of very little people everywhere especially in an area where a fall wasn\u2019t an unreasonable expectation. Luckily no one fell.",
          "This was a fun little hike with three kids in tow. My boys thought it was really cool and we came back a few days later to do the hike again. The area can get crowded, but we went early in the morning and had the area to ourselves for a short time!",
          "We went with our baby and toddler, we had lots of fun hiking around, and snapping cute photos. We enjoyed our time at Papago park.",
          "This was a unique short hike to the \"Hole in the Rock\". It presented several photo opportunities and can be enjoyed by young and old alike.",
          "If you are in the area already then it's not not a bad view at Sunset. Can get very crowded, which can make it good to see if an idiot or two will fall off, given how they were climbing around when we were there. But in the end, it is a rock formation, I wouldn't be making a",
          "Better to see this afar or up close. Bring the kids for a very easy climb inside the hole. Great view of cars parked in the parking lot. Be adventurous and boulder up top to see a better view....of cars.",
          "Nice place for a quick stop in Phoenix. Look out for all the people nearly toppling off the rock getting selfies.",
          "If you are new to viewing cool rock formations, this is a good place to start. Located within Papago park, it is easy to get there and close to downtown Phoenix. Parking can be a challenge near the actual Hole in the Rock. There is a trail that winds around and up to the \"hole\"",
          "Located in Papago park with very easy highway access. Free to park. When you first get there you think that there is no way to get up there until you realize that there is a VERY easy trail around the back.",
          "Almost anyone can do this hike, it's 5 minutes to get to the hole. The view is very nice and relaxing.",
          "This literal hole in the rock is cool, and it's a short easy hike (if you take the trail). But...it's kind of a \"Disneyland trail\" meaning it's super, super crowded. I liked other trails in Papago Park better, because you had more solitude. Even better, go to one of the",
          "I visited here while waiting for a friend's plane to arrive, it's a short drive to the airport and another free place to hike. The climb to the hole takes 10-15 minutes from the parking lot. It's picturesque from the top and a great photo op. Trails around the park provide",
          "The name says it all. It is a rock with a hole in it. Plenty of parking. You have to walk around to the backside of the rock if you want to climb up to the \"hole\". This is located next to the zoo. Neat view from the hole. You can be as quick as you want as their is not much to",
          "What a fun little walk. Compared to the one I had done a few days before this was definitely a walk in a park. 5 minutes up and 5 minutes down.",
          "What a beautiful place with amazing views!!! It\u2019s worth visiting and climbing. It has a wonderful view of Phoenix.",
          "The Hole in the Rock has a great view from the top, but tons of people means it's hard to get the picture you might want to take.",
          "Nice little trip to climbing for people who are not too athletic. Fun and easy to climb and has great views. Nice place to have a picnic.",
          "It was well worth a trip to Papago Park, kids loved this place. We took plenty of pictures. After visiting there, we went to the lake which again is beautiful. Worth the visit!",
          "This natural formation is a great photo op for most that visit. It has great views from the top or bottom. DO NOT be intimidated by the climb though as it is very gradual and easy for most.",
          "We stopped here after we got Out of the airport and we are So glad we did ! It is a very simple climb and very nice at the top for views!",
          "We stumbled across this location not even knowing it existed. It caught our eye when we were headed to The Phoenix Zoo but it was closed. The rock/mountain is an easy climb and an amazing spot to watch the sunset, desert mountains and see planes fly overhead. It was quite",
          "This was my first stop on the way from the airport to a local hotel. The climb is more like a walk upward. I saw one person wearing Ugg boots, which I wouldn't recommend for this, but it's apparently possible. If you're visiting the area and planning on hiking, invest in a",
          "This was a short, semi steep walk to the hole in the back which allowed for a cool view of the city and the rock provides some appreciated shade. Only plan to spend 30 minutes here, it is a short walk from parking, but nice for a little getaway.",
          "The hole is wonderful it picture frames the city of Phoenix great for a short hike and photo shots While in the area the Papago park has some other great hiking trails",
          "Ok, I'm one of the tourists making this place a tourist trap. But even as a tourist, I generally dislike crowded places, and this place was super-crowded when my wife and I went. It was hard to even make the very short hike up to the hole. The hike itself is very easy and only",
          "It was a fun trek to see the hole in the rock. If it is a hot day bring some water because you will need it.",
          "I bragged all day that I \u201cclimbed a mountain!\u201d It was a fun, short hike. The trails in the park have beautiful views and native landscapes. The rock formations are impressive, there are a variety of cacti and bushes. The water and palms were nice as well. It was a great place to",
          "We had an unexpected layover in Phoenix airport and had a short time to visit. Going here at sunset was so much fun.",
          "We climbed up to the hole in the rock during sunset. It was beautiful! We loved watching all the planes coming in to land at the airport. It\u2019s an easy climb. Get there early for a sunset seat!",
          "The view great, great trails, Phz zoo near by, pack a lunch and enjoy the scenery of city. It very short walk up to the top.",
          "We wandered over here from the zoo, which was okay. The climb was easy, only 2 of our kids made the trek (teenagers were too lazy). Not too busy and great views from the top. If you have bad knees or hips, it will be difficult to get up by the hole. There are some stone steps",
          "This is an easy sight to see in Phoenix. There is plenty of parking and a nice trail to follow. The short hike does have some stairs to climb which takes you right onto the red rocks.",
          "We were there around 3pm on a Monday, so it wasn't very busy - but just before we left, a tour bus arrived along with many cars and it became super busy. An nice point to stop at for just a short visit.",
          "This was a fabulous very short (~.5mi) hike around the back of a rock formation with rock stairs up to the actual Hole in the Rock. Really unique views of the whole city. Popular spot on a weekend afternoon (obviously) - highly recommend going at some other time if you want some",
          "We did this hike when our son had just turned 4 and again this trip as a 5.5 year old. It is perfect for young kids. Easy, quick, and a beautiful view at the top. We spent more time exploring around hole in the rock this time just wandering around the trails. There is also a",
          "Located in Papago Park is this unique viewpoint. Entrance is free. From the parking lot the trail weaves behind. It is not hard and currently being improved. From the hole you can see an amazing view of the park and the Phoenix area.",
          "This is perfect for those who don't hike, it's a short walk up the backside of the rock, for the prettiest views around. Make sure you walk over to the pond after to soak in those views as well.",
          "Kinda cool to see the formations of these massive rocks, and to sit in the hole and view the valley well it\u2019s worth going to and it\u2019s close to the zoo.",
          "Dessert location with mountains and hiking opportunities. If you\u2019re in shape you can climb and get a view from the top. The climb takes about 40 min.",
          "Hole in the Rock is in Papago Park right next to the Phoenix Zoo, it is a pretty popular spot to watch the sunset so parking next to Hole In the Rock might be full (apx 10 to 15 parking spots in front) but there is plenty of parking around. It's a short little climb, even the",
          "The name is the description. Located right next to the zoo and botanical gardens, you enter from the back and hike up a small set of stairs to the top, about five minutes or less. The view is amazing from up top.",
          "An awesome place to take pictures for social media and to have a romantic picnic. Real close to the Botanical garden which is worth a visit.",
          "I mean, yeah, that's about it. Yeah, there's some history about the natives and the sun shining on a specific spot to mark the seasons. But it's basically just a hole in a rock. It is, however, good to whet your appetite for the more spectacular stones and rocks further north.",
          "Located in Papago park, this is one of the \"must do\" items while visiting Phoenix. Unlike some of the other trails in town, the climb to Hole in the Rock is very simple and doesn't take more than 10 minutes. The views from the hole are fantastic and it's a great place to hang",
          "Fantastic views! From ages 6 to 67 we all climbed to the top and enjoyed the view! A must stop on your visit to Phoenix!",
          "The view of the surrounding area is Awesome from here!! Don't miss it when you visit Phoenix. Enjoy a picnic at Papago Park after your visit at the Hole in the Rock.",
          "Great place to relax and enjoy the view. Saw a beautiful sunset. I am a photographer and shot the sunset over the mountains. Also the city lights. There is a building there made of stones. Very rustic. Very popular place. Worth the short drive from the Phoenix area. And",
          "This site is close to the zoo. A fun and easy way to spend a few hours. It is a short hike & climb to a nice view of the valley.",
          "Phoenix has changed the access and parking and it is more burdensome. The trail used to be stepped and easy to traverse with parking right at the rock base on the back side. Now, the trail is rough, eroded and slippery and you have to hike around the rock to get to the trail to",
          "Coming from hiking in Sedona, this place is a let down but we were still in mood for hiking so we went. We went on a Friday after breakfast so the heat wasn't bad then and plenty of parking. There were only few people and the pathway isn't bad. There were some sharps stone but",
          "It's a nice place to visit, but nothing much special about it. There a bit of walking to reach that place. Most of the times its very crowded as the where the hole is, is very limited.",
          "This was a really good outdoor activity. Was free and kids could also attempt this with no problems. Would highly recommend.",
          "We have been here before. It is a very easy hike and a great picture site too. There is a picnic area, along with bathrooms. A short walk away there is also a little fishing pond. This place is perfect for families. The zoo is close by too.",
          "This place is not as secret as it once used to be, but it's still worth your time if you're already in the area and looking for a quick place to explore. Do NOT come here in the summer though, save it for fall/winter time, otherwise you're asking for a miserable time. Also it",
          "This was a fun experience and Papago Park has some beautiful areas. Unfortunately the actual area of the hole in the rock was very crowded and overrun with rude people and obnoxious kids. I\u2019d recommend going on a weekday when school is in session if you\u2019re looking for a serene",
          "Our group of friends came here for a nice afternoon visit. It was fun to hike the rock and take in the views. It was simple and easy to follow the paths. Your could have a picnic here or take in the zoo while in the area.",
          "Had fun with my photography group taking pictures and climbing around on the rocks. The caretakers do a great job of keeping the place nice. Great place to take the family.",
          "It's cool if you want to hike up there to get your photo made inside but Phoenix is so hot that I opted out. The park surrounding is a pretty desert park",
          "Glad we visited. The walk from the parking lot was short and easy. We enjoyed the views from the top and were pleasantly surprised to have the place to our self. We went on the 4th of July and the parking lots were all closed as of 3 pm except over by the zoo, making for a",
          "For someone not used to the Arizona weather and landscape, this is a must go. The hike itself was not challenging but the 115 degrees made my family and me feel like heroes once we got to the top.",
          "It was a skating 109 degrees! But we made it to the hole. Such a beautiful view with a nice breeze. Be careful going down coz the tiny rocks are quite slippery. I had a good roll down with some bruises and cuts. But it was worth it!",
          "Very interesting. Short hike to the hole in the rock. Lot of rock climbing if you want. Nice park area surrounding the area.",
          "My friend and I went here on a hot, 107 degree day. We parked our car right at the trailhead. The actual trail was very well marked and very short at only 0.3 miles. Once we walked through the hole, the views were amazing!",
          "Go late in the day during summer. After 4 or before 10am is go too. Fun with our 6 yr old plus a couple of teens. Pretty lake/pond close by....bring lunch there are picnic tables. Nice for killing an hour or so. Small playground for little kids. Good place for pics",
          "During our recent business trip to Scottsdale Arizona we did a little side trip to Hole in the rock park. If it had not been 105 degrees I may have enjoyed it more but it is just a hole in a rock. not much there.",
          "Lots of parking space, easy to find, no entrance fee, going up there was easy. Perfect place to have those instagram moments. It\u00b4s a beautiful place in Papago Park. Clean and well kept. A must-visit in Arizona.",
          "Hole in the Rock in Papago Park is a wonderful place to hike to and take pictures. You can stand in the rock and see the city! It is a gentle hike up the back of the rock, even for this 55+ woman with fibromyalgia! Once at the top you can be daring and some people rock climb",
          "My kids in Phoenix took us to the Hole In The Rock at Papago Park this spring and we had such a fun time there! The climb to the hole was easy enough for all of us including our 2 year old grandbaby, and the view at the top was spectacular! At the bottom there is a lovely huge",
          "Looking for a quick scenic trip in Tempe without taking an all day climb? Hole in the Rock is near the zoo and is a great easy hike for those looking to absorb the amazing view of the valley and the Phoenix/ Tempe area with mountains in the background. Caution, the rocks are",
          "Went here at about 3p on a weekday (it was very hot - 107). Brought water with me, even though it's only about a 200 yard hike. Pretty neat views of Tempe/Phoenix to the south. Parking was easy. Be aware of bee activity. Allow 30-45 min.",
          "Free, fast easy walk, close to airport. We had some time before the plane took off so we went to see the Hole in the Rock.",
          "This is free, it's easy, and a fun thing to do. I wouldn't drive an hour to do it, but if it's in your area of travel, certainly give it a try. It's an easy groomed path that brings you to the hole - photo ops on both sides of it. Very cool with breezes in the shade and nice",
          "A very short hike to the top, there is a path to follow. Great place to take photos without having to hike a long ways. I would recommend going early. There were quite a few people there when we were at the top so couldn\u2019t enjoy it as much.",
          "This was an easy walk, but I would recommend wearing tennis shoes. My mother and I walked up and enjoyed the sites. I would say it took about 20-30 minutes to go up, down, and enjoy the views. It is free with parking.",
          "We stopped by here with our family group of 7 and we all loved it! Only about a 10 minute walk up for those with sure feet, it's a fun place to look around and take a few pictures of the views and the hole! We walked around by the water afterwards and saw an unusual bird too.",
          "This is a short and easy hike almost anyone can do! Dogs are also allowed here. The hole is pretty cool and leads to a little area in the rock where you can sit and enjoy the views. And it\u2019s free!",
          "Firstly, just a couple of tips on getting there and walking to it. Head for the zoo and when you turn off N Galvin towards the car park, take the first left into Papago road and follow it around \u2013 you\u2019ll see the small car park in front of the \u2018hole\u2019. Despite some reviews",
          "It is an easy hike but well worth it. You can conbine with the visit of the botanic garden and the zoo. Just make sure you use sunscreen...",
          "Just a pit stop for a photo. However there are lots of spots in the park to have a peaceful picnic lunch",
          "The Hole in the Rock is an interesting photo subject. I arrived at sunrise on a cool Sunday morning to avoid crowds, and to have a clear and uncluttered view through my lens. That turned out to be the right move, as I had the place to myself for about 10 minutes.",
          "Awesome views not a bad hike to get up there. Definitely a must see and do while in the area. Great picture taking while up there.",
          "Close to Scottsdale, easy to find and walk up to; great photo ops; lovely views. Public restrooms nearby.",
          "I had asked my Aunt & Uncle if they ever heard of the \"Hole In The Rock\" at Papago Park, they had never heard of it, even after living in the Phoenix area for 15 years. We mapped the location and found our way to the park. It is adjacent to the Phoenix Zoo. When we approached",
          "After visiting Phoenix may times, this was our first trip to the Hole in the Rock. I wish we had done it earlier! There is a path on the back side of the rock formation. It is not an aggressive hike, but individuals could benefit from trekking poles if concerned. Our group",
          "We always enjoy seeing cool and natural sites such as this and my daughter just loves to climb. This is a short walk from the zoo with a nice park area and a play area for kids. A must see.",
          "If you had this funny rock with a hole in the middle of it, wouldn't you create a park to surround it? It's fun to climb or walk, although you do need to be careful and perhaps brave. Very pretty/scenic.",
          "We visited with our 2 teenage boys and everyone had a great time. There is a short hike around to rear of the rock where you climb up into the hole. From there my boys and I went up top which is a little more challenging climb and not for young children. Up on top there are a",
          "Its exactly what it it says it is. A hole in a rock. It's a short easy hike to the top that affords some nice views and some good photo ops. It's a quick stop, so if your in the area or passing through. It's a fun thing to do.",
          "We had a few hours before our flight and decided to visit to kill some time. So glad we did! We joined a large group of people watching the sunset, and then we took a walk around the lake to say hi to the ducks and stretch our legs. Bathrooms close at 7 PM.",
          "I had just a few hours to visit just outside of the city. This was a great quick stop for a short hike to the hole. The views are gorgeous. I am glad I got the opportunity to go and would recommend it to others.",
          "All eight in our group hiked up. Easy. Great photo op. All ages can hike up. Easy to park also. Good views.",
          "It was a great little walk, so easy that I wouldn\u2019t classify it as a hike. It is about .33 miles from the parking lot to the top. Good shoes with tread are still necessary because at the top the rock is super smooth from all the visitors sitting and walking on it. We went around",
          "Found this nice gem today. Very easy hike but fulfilling. Beautiful views especially at sunset. Small ponds close by with fishing. Free parking close by. Can get crowded especially when the tour buses come.",
          "I loved this quick hike! It is a gorgeous view and fun climb. We went with our 2 kids 7 and 3 and were able to hike comfortably. Highly recommend it for families!",
          "Out exploring the area and stopped at the Hole in the Rock. It is a fairly easy hike and the view from the top is amazing with some cool photo opportunities. It is better if you go early before the heat of the day and even though the hike isn't long or too difficult, I",
          "If you want a very good view of Phoenix, then this is the place to go. You can look out from the shade of the 'hole' so you do not have to squint to get a good southern view of Tempe & Phoenix. Half the fun is getting up there, but don't worry because the trail goes around to",
          "Spent the week in Sedona and had an hour to kill before we needed to be at the airport. Found this spot and decided to give it a try. 30 minutes was plenty of time to spend there hiking up and sitting. Views were pretty, not crowded and great for kids. Super, super easy to get",
          "Just barely off the plane and already we\u2019ve taken waaay too many pictures. Worth the stop for sure. Bring you\u2019re climbing shoes if you\u2019re planning on going to the top.",
          "This is in Papago Park. Easy to find. The hike from parking lot to hole is make 7 minutes... If you\u2019re slow and smelling all the desert roses. Be careful to stay on the outlines path because the \u201cshortcuts\u201d have been deliberately left off the trail in order to revegetate the",
          "This is a well-utilized and short hike to a cool geological formation with a great view. It is more crowded than I typically like when I hike or explore, however, it is an interesting place to go for a quick visit.",
          "not much to say about this but i will say stunning place. very hot when we was there so make sure u take plenty of refreshments",
          "We visited hole in the rock mid march and we went around 10am. It was just starting to get busy. The hike up to the hole was super easy... not even 5 minutes. The views were pretty good and the photo ops were great. There were several oasis\u2019s in the park and other trails to",
          "Our first stop before the Desert Botanical Garden and it was a lot of fun. The kids liked the walk up and was very easy and the views were beautiful!",
          "This s pretty close to metro Phoenix and Tempe. Right by the zoo. accessible parking and easy short hike as others indicate. It's not a spectacular view, but unique rock formation. Worth a trip if you want to picnic or visit the zoo as well.",
          "The hike itself is not intense but it can get a bit crowded. If taking pictures, it may be wise to go a bit earlier when there is less people.",
          "Very easy to hike and very short , works great for your kids or anyone first hike Worth the try mostly for pictures",
          "It looks cooler then the hike is...Its the shortest of all hikes in the Phoenix area but really cool for kids 5 to 12 years old with a lot of cave like holes in the rock. Its fun to see but the hiking in the Phoenix area has a lot more to offer. But its close to the zoo and",
          "I really like to take my guests and visitors there. The hike up is really just 10 min, and the pictures are amazing. Nice views of Papago Park and the city! Great for the whole family!",
          "Papago Park offers some beautiful views, short hikes and even the Phoenix zoo. Parking wasn't too challenging as folks are constantly coming and going from this attraction. It is just a very short hike up to Hole in the Rock. You will get some amazing pictures. Then hop back",
          "This was an easy, little hike with some nice views and good photo opportunities. We found a parking place nearby. You can see the zoo entrance close by.",
          "This is a fun location right next to the zoo. For those who like nature and a view this is a very easy hike and a unique way to see the surrounding area. There are some great photo opportunities with views from all directions including views of Camelback mountain.",
          "While visiting Phoenix we went to see Papago park and the Hole in the rock. The area is quite beautiful and the climb to the rock is very easy. The views of the city from the rock are amazing and the interaction with nature and the city is quite impressive. My family loved it",
          "Took the kids here on while in Phoenix for two days. Definitely a place to visit if you don\u2019t have a lot of time. Good views, short walk, and gives you a flavor of what the desert is like and what other longer hiking trails would be like. Easy hike to the top. Kids had no",
          "This is a beautiful place to watch the sunrise and sunset. great view also watch all the planes flying in and out of airport.",
          "It gets crowded quickly, especially on weekends. Easy hike for everyone. Absolutely gorgeous views and great place to take out of town visitors.",
          "You can climb to the \"Hole\" and wander about, but the park and trails are littered and crowded. A better outing is to the Botanical Gardens next door (fee) or South Mountain Park a few minutes away.",
          "We stopped on a lark - so worth it! Just keep driving up towards it - you'll pass several lots but there's a lot right underneath the rock. Easy path up and I'm not a good trail climber. View through the hole is awesome!",
          "This is a fun nature area that you can walk or hike. Lots of great views. You can make it a cautious or more daring trip depending on the path (or not) you choose. Several people brought dogs. Very close to the zoo so easy to do both activities.",
          "This short hike will take you to the sandstone Hole in the Rock. Beautiful views of the city of Phoenix and beyond. Bring the camera for fun shots of the kids. Be aware that there are steep areas on this climb. Hold on to the smaller kids climbing with you!",
          "Very nice park. We had a picnic lunch and then hiked up to the hole in the rock. Beautiful view from the top, even for someone scared of heights.",
          "This is located in the Papago Park next the zoo. It is a short and easy climb up this sandstone hill that has various holes and cave like features. It is rumored that the local Indians used it as a solar calendar to help tell the start of different seasons. There is a good",
          "I took my young kids on this hike. It's an easy trail that gets a tiny bit steep at the end. It's fun to climb through the hole and hang out in the cave. You can see wonderful views from the cave. Restrooms are available right down the road.",
          "We drove 3 mins up the road from the Desert Botanical Garden to see this wonder. So cool! Parking is available here for free. Its a short climb up to the hole. Great photo opportunity! You can sit on the rocks in the hole and see all of Phoenix. We were there for the sunset and",
          "We visited Hole in the Rock after the Desert Botanical Gardens. They're close to each other. I did not not hike up to the top, but my husband did and encountered a bride and groom getting photographed, so I guess the climb isn't too bad!",
          "I visited with my grand-kids the Hole in the Rock located in Papago Park in Phoenix. We hiked to the where the hole is. It was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend it.",
          "If you have a few hours to stop by Papago Pk on PHX/Tempe border this is a nice place to relax. It is a short walk up side of a large hill and when you get to top you sit in a large hole with spectacular views of east PHX (looking west). If with children be careful as a",
          "Easy climb! My friend and I are from Florida (the flattest land ever) and comfortably climbed up and around Hole in the Rock. I am so glad we went, because the views are amazing and so are the photo ops! Highly recommend to visit with your kids and family if you are visiting the",
          "My husband and I are planning on moving to Arizona and came for a visit. The weather was soooo nice (came from Illinois -10), I suggested we spend as much time as possible outside. After reading reviews on other areas that were more difficult, I decided on this spot. It was",
          "It is a short hike from the parking lot below. It is a rocky hike that I have to carry my 2 year old most of the hike. I wish people will not throw their trash on the trail. We saw broken glasses, empty water bottles and even dog feces. It gets crowded and there is a wait to",
          "I dropped in to see this site before the botanical garden opened and just before the sun rose. Parking is very close and it\u2019s just a short, moderate climb to the place you want to be. There are actually two holes - one you walk through and a smaller one you can see through.",
          "It is an easy but steep hike to the top. The view from the top is great, including a nice view of the zoo.",
          "Easy hike offering a great opportunity to snap a photo that will speak volumes. Easily accessible from a very close parking lot. Free entry and accessible via car or walk/bike paths. This stop offers a quick trail that can be navigated by almost anyone. I would not qualify this",
          "What an amazing spot! Easily hiked trail to\u2026 a hole in a rock! We parked in one of the first parking lots and hiked in, maybe a quarter mile. From the parking lots the trail leads to the back of the mountain and easily leads to the hole. In the rock. It pretty impressive for a",
          "I have never seen a rock like that, and it is interesting to see. While it does not seem to be very high, it is impossible to climb to the hole from the front of the rock. But there is a easy path to go from the back.",
          "It is a neighborhood secret and we learn that from our stay in La Quinta last year and when visiting this year, we paid another visit. Free parking and free admission. A wonderful climb up there to look down. The restrooms are quite clean. Good and nice place to have picnic too,",
          "The hole looks impressive from the parking lot. The best part is the path around the rock is a gradual incline to the back where you can then walk through the hole and enjoy the view. Don't forget to look up when you get to the back and see the hole in the top also.",
          "This is the BEST place in the valley to have senior pictures taken or engagement photos taken. The little climb is well worth it as the view of the city is splendid!",
          "We went there yesterday for the beautiful sunset overlooking the city. It\u2019s an amazing view. The hike is easy and short. The first hour was fine but as the sun was setting, there were a lot more people and it\u2019s getting overcrowded.",
          "some of the trail is difficult if you have walking disabilities. the view was nice but nothing special the day we went. It might be different depending on what time of day you go",
          "A great place to climb and be out in nature. Interesting background surrounding this place, in the middle of the city.",
          "A great day for inexpensive fun for a family. If you are in to climbing or just want to walk around, this is a great place to view.",
          "So satisfying to actually climb around on the red rocks! Wonderful park with so much to do. We'd recommend this to anyone who goes to Phoenix!",
          "Stopped by on a weekday morning and had the place to ourselves for about ten minutes. Easy hike to get to the hole. Lovely views on a clear day looking out over Phoenix.",
          "first time visiting very impressed and had a lot of fun. pretty kool place to go. a must see when in PHX !!",
          "We are not avid hikers by any means, but this was not a daunting rock and with a well laid out path, a relatively easy climb and one that was SO worth the effort! The views from the top (even if you don't go through the \"hole\") makes the climb worth it!",
          "This was a fun place to spend 20-30 minutes at the end of the day to climb, sit, and watch the sunset. There's a fairly simple path to climb up to the top, and parking is easy.",
          "It was very crowded when i went on a Sunday and it was almost impossible to get near the hole but when i went back on Tuesday i was able to climb through. It's not as hard to get up there as it looks from the front so if you get the chance it's a great photo op",
          "Very short hike from the parking lot (next to the zoo). The trail is bumpy, rocky, steep and very, very short...just around and up the back of the butte. Your reward? A hole in the role that overlooks Phoenix area and the wind gently whoosing through. Great photo spot,",
          "What a cool place to walk up to. It is easy. And even better when you get someone to take your picture up here. We say new car photographers using this as the background in the park for Ford!",
          "This hole in a very large rock is naturally occurring and is very neat to experience. The parking area for it can be access off the road to the zoo behind the park ranger hqs. There is a short walk around to the rear of the rock and then you can go up into the hole itself. Be",
          "A little bit of a \"hike\" but very doable for pretty much anyone. I took my mother and her friends (65-70 ish in age) to watch the sunset on this visit. They loved it and the walk was just enough to make them feel like they accomplished something by making it up to \"the hole\"",
          "Very easy to get to. Once car is parked, it's right there. Can easily walk up to the rock. People were climbing up to the hole, we did not. Has bathrooms, and water fountains. Quiet, and a must see",
          "The formation is cool to see, and it\u2019s a short walk to the hole. It is neat seeing the view from the top. Doesn\u2019t take long to check out.",
          "It's easy to get to if your already at the zoo or Botanical garden already but I would not go here just for this. It's a hole in a rock that you can see from the parking lot. I did not climb to it but have been told by many its worth the small hike if your already there.",
          "This is a great, short, hike, if you have small kids, or creaky knees, or just want something quick. the hike is maybe a quarter mile and the view is pretty cool. However, if you are looking for solitude, or cardiovascular exercise, try something else. :)",
          "If you love hiking than you will love this place and the views are just so beautiful especially at night",
          "We had a few hours to do some sightseeing in Phoenix before we needed to be at the airport. I found Hole in the Rock in an online search. It wasn't far from where we were staying and we were really surprised that this park was so close to the downtown. We hiked up to the Hole",
          "My 8 year old absolutely loved it just as much as the wife and I. The easy climb is worth the views. The pictures from up here came out amazing. Will be returning again.",
          "This Hole in the Rock is a geographical masterpiece. If I didn't see it with my own eyes I wouldn't have believed how beautiful and majestic it is. It was 4 of us friends and 2 small children and the hike was vigorous yet not overwhelming. With the 2 boys and stopping for a",
          "I wouldn't consider this a hike. The parking lot is steps from the rock. You walk around the back of the rock and up to the hole. That's it.",
          "Easy hike, plenty of parking and lots to see. It is not a very steep climb but you still need to watch your step. You can park right at the bottom of it.",
          "Considering this is a tourist must, it wasn\u2019t too impressive. Walk around back and up a little. Okay.",
          "Great and easy last minute hike, but was rewarded with a great view of the valley. Needs to be cleaned a bit more often, and maybe add a safety fence or something.",
          "We brought my grandson here for some photos. The grounds are absolutely beautiful by the Hole in the Rock with nearby duck pond. I would definitely come back with the family for more pics or just to walk the grounds.",

          "This is in Papago Park and is only one of many hiking trails. This is quite easy to climb and my kids loved it.",
          "The hike is steep but short. The view is amazing! While the hike is short, remember to bring water. Great short hike to do with kids.",
          "This was a nice easy hike in Phoenix, and had a nice view once you got to the top. Even though it is not a long hike, remember to bring water!",
          "I had a couple of hours to kill before a flight and was looking for something to do in the area. Nice, easy hike from the parking lot to see an interesting rock formation. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this, but if you are in the area and looking for a quick distraction",
          "Just incredible! Had a hot afternoon to kill in Phoenix so decided to take a look at a hole! Super - But I love History! Was hot September... at 15H - Take water a hat and sun cream! O+I only wanted to walk up see the hole and take some photo's ... I would suggest with a picnic",
          "This is a quick pic spot. The hike is easy even in Birks. Loved this little park. We went at sunset time and it was gorgeous.",
          "I go to Papago park whenever I can and I often see families climbing on this for a great group photo, If you are going somewhere for exercise this is a nice relaxing stop to make while you are there.",

          "Visited on a hot day so need water when walking from the parking lot which was free. Climb was not too bad and well worth it when at the top and view Phoenix through the 'hole'. There is also a nearby lake adjacent to the parking lot which is worth a walk around.",
          "We had time after the airport for a quick trip here. (Only 20 min from airport). We went on a Saturday morning around 10am and the hike was maybe 10 min (max). The view was great, parking was free, and there were only 7-10 other people there the entire 45 min we were there.",
          "Just another free and awesome place to visit. Great views and fun climbing around. Easy access and not a difficult trail to the hole. Would be simple for any able bodied person including children. There is parking at the base. We were lucky that there were only a few people",
          "Hole in Rock Park is an interesting geological formation next to the zoo and a large lake I went early on a Saturday morning and there was plenty of parking. There is a rough trail up to the hole (not handicapped accessible) and you get a nice view through the hole (just",
          "My family and I visited this place and it is truly majestic. It's easy to climb, even for kids. My son is 3 years old and managed to climb easily. I recommend this place, only they should visit it very early or late because it is too hot in the city.",
          "this is best place to see sunset and plane take off landing at same time. Adventurous place + very good place to hang out with best buddies or friends. You need park your car bit far and have to walk bit, but experience will more good.",
          "Great experience and good exercise ! For the entire family just be carful with the rocks went you going up because don't have stairs",
          "Nice hiking area around the park if you can clime the main area is the hole in the rock. photographers dream.",

          "Going to the Hole in the Rock is a nice and very accessible tour for people with short time in the city but with the need to feel the Sonoran Desert. Parking cannot be easier, specially if you leave the car at the Phoenix Zoo, a few yards away. Climbing the rock and seeing the",
          "Too hot for long walk so opted for Hole in the Rock. Next door to Phoenix Zoo, so you could do both if you like. Lucky for us, it was fairly quiet. Would be nightmare for photos during peak times. Plenty free parking after care taken in actually finding it. Short walk round",
          "Looking around for things to do before I moved out of Phoenix, and found this place. I'd live in Phoenix for over 10 years and this was the first time I've been here. Not a good place to hike if you need a stroller. People constantly moving around. Sunset views are amazing. It's",
          "We will generally not come here by its self. We visit the zoo often and at times will want to climb the rock. Cool views and an easy hike for all ages.",
          "This is a great place to go. Climb up to the hole, enter, and take a picture! Apart from the awesome photo op, it is a very beautiful, natural place to visit. It is nestled right in between a picnic area and the Phoenix zoo. The Phoenix zoo is also a great place to visit.",
          "This was near the zoo...just a small walk up..the views were great. We were walking the small mountain by Arizona State University and a local told us to stop by here - so glad we did!!",
          "It's a short, easy hike up to the 'hole'. Great views and photos from the top and from the bottom. Worth the 20 minute stop if you're in the area.",
          "Short hike up to the top. There are some loose rocks on the path, so wear appropriate footwear. Views are very pretty when you get up there.",
          "easy climb to the hole if you take the trail to the right. not suitable for sandals due to the dirt and gravel. even those who can't/don't want to hike, can get a great view.",
          "Beautiful rock formation. Nice Vista of Phoenix and environs. Accessible by taking an easy hike. Recommended for all ages.",
          "Easy walk of 5 minutes to arrive to the hole. The view is really great and the visit is fast. Take te time to go on the lake, we saw a lot of animals, and a very nice snake was swimming !!!!!",
          "Different than google maps show. It's above and you climb behind the mountain. There are stairs and free parking. Great views and not too difficult. Kid friendly.",
          "This is just a short drive from downtown Phoenix. Easy to find, free to park. We climbed around and took funny photos until the heat caught up with us. Very interesting natural exhibit.",
          "I've been here twice now. Once back in February and again in May when a friend was visiting. If you're in Phoenix and don't have time for a hike, or can't do the long hot desert trails, this is a quick stop you can go to to check out some of the local scenery. It's a fairly",
          "While in the Phoenix area we wanted to check out this hole in the rock. The website at found it on stated that this was an easy short hike. And it should have been, but I can't lie, I struggled. As my job requires me to be in an office chair 9 hours a day, with an additional",
          "best time to go is early before it gets to hot, if you go around noon it'll be to busy with tourists,wear comfortable shoes and take a walking stick with you it's quite a hike up there, watch out for loose rocks and slithery guest (snakes) that might cross your path, be safe and",
          "I went there with my family ,it was good place to see around and easy to walk with little kids .good place",
          "Perfect way to capstone my family trip to Phoenix. It was a local easy hike on a beautiful spring/summer day. recommend this to all visiting the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Beautiful views of the zoo and Phoenix. Well worth the short walk to it's \"top.\" It's a serene spot good",
          "This is a lovely spot in the middle of Phoenix. Easy to get to and plenty of other entertainment options near by. There was free parking and not too crowded.",
          "A very pretty easy hike. Parking was close to the the trail. The trail was rougher than expected. A previous review said good for grandma's and toddlers. I wouldn't recommend for anyone who isn't nimble and mobile. Plan to spend 45 min or so.",
          "Papago Park as a whole is a pretty neat place. Hole in the Rock is somewhat interesting considering its past use and purpose but is, well, nothing special. Worth a quick stop when in Papago Park but not a special trip.",
          "It's a short \"hike\" to the top. Keep in mind it is loose dirt so wear tennis shoes, especially because it gets a little steep at the top (but totally doable, nothing scary at all). The views are gorgeous and it is just worth it. Plus the surrounding park is lovely :)",
          "Tiny hike up to the \"hole\". Grandmas and toddlers can make it. Super view of Papago Park, Zoo and surrounding area. It's easy to do, why miss it?",
          "A lovely view of the city and surrounding desert. Very easy to get to and park, and the walk up is not too strenuous.",
          "I had to see what all the fuss was about. I'm fairly out of shape but was still able to get to it. I love the view of the city from here! It's not as high up as you'd think!",
          "The park and area around it are very pretty. It is connected the Zoo parking area. The park is free to walk around and climb to the whole in the rock. It was a neat experience and good photo opportunity.",
          "This was a great hike to take with our two boys (ages 7 and 4) on. We hiked it in flip flops, not recommended but do-able! The views were awesome!",
          "This was very close to where we were staying so we popped by. Pretty easy trail to the hole, but it was very popular/crowded especially with families. View was ok, it is a fairly unique geological formation but not unheard of. The greater Phoenix area has a lot to offer, so this",
          "This is a pretty spot. The walk up is easy and the view is beautiful. It was very windy before going through the hole. Once we stepped through it was easy to touch the wall and go down the steps. We had fun looking at all the rocks and seeing what animals or things we could see",
          "We've been traveling all over Arizona, but this rock formation was a little different from all the rest. My 8 year old son loves opportunities to climb around and just be a kid, so this was a great spot for him. Cool views and a nice shady, breezy spot in the hole. Take a camera!",
          "It's an easy walk from parking to the hole in the rock. Can be several people there sometimes. Visit the zoo and Papago Park also while you're in this area. Scottsdale is also a short distance away.",
          "My wife and I had visited the Phoenix zoo and were on our way out of the park when we saw the Hole in the Rock. We had to stop and soak up the experience. The trail up the back way was fairly easy and not long (10 minutes maybe). There were quite a few people in the Hole in the",
          "This is pretty cool to see! It does get a bit crowded there if it's a day that everyone has off. Not too hard to get up there either, you can definitely take kids.",
          "This is a spectacular place very close to the Zoo. It is easy to reach but if you want to climb up for the full experience you need closed shoes. Beware of the bees. To the hole in the rock you need 5 minutes uphill walk. I recommend late afternoon for best view.",
          "This hike to the hole in the rock was easy enough for our 5 year old son. The hole itself is pretty cool, but there are some slippery spots, so you have to be mindful of small children slipping. It was a neat structure.",
          "Great family outing ! The family liked the challenge provided . The views were great ! Definitely would climb this again .",
          "At first it looks intimidating and only for experienced/crazy hikers. Then we found the path that goes around the back and it turned out to be an easy hike/walk up to the hole. Very impressive!",
          "It's an OK view, but the 'hike' was way easier than I had expected it would be (don't know why I was expecting anything though lol). It's a great spot if you have a stroller or wheelchair, though!",
          "This park is conveniently located next to the zoo so you can do both on the same day. It is an easy hike and you are well rewarded with great views.",
          "Perfect for young ones, easy to hike, short distance, cool formations at the top! Go in the morning for a fun hike/climb experience.",
          "This is a great place for a short period of time. You have access to great views and can take some interesting pictures. I have taken people of here of various ages and interests and all have enjoyed, I would recommend pairing it with either the zoo or the desert botanical",
          "at certain times this place will have a lot of traffic. Overall, it is a very pretty, easy hike for the family.",
          "Very easy going hike with beautiful views. There are lots of places to take photos on the way up to the top, not just at the hole. Once at the top there are places to sit and rest, take pictures or just admire the view. It wasn't crowded when we were there in April, but I can",
          "The Papago Park is interersting and so too the hole in the rock. Be prepared for a somewhat difficult climb as the loose gravel and the sometimes steep incline can be hiking difficult.",
          "The Hole in the Rock is an easy place to get to without much effort, just drive thru the Phoenix zoo parking and stay to the left for access to the Hole in the Rock parking. . Easy climb to the top but you still need to be careful. Good view on both sides.",
          "Since we were at Papago Park and visited the Zoo and Botanical Gardens, we stopped here as well. We took about 20-30 minutes to hike up and walk around. Very worth the stop if you are in the area already. Not sure I would drive out here just for this.",
          "Enjoy a wonderful walk or climb. No question about it folks, you need to bring good walking shoes, water, a hat and be ready for the heat. Sunscreen is important too. Walk the path or hike up the huge hill. It is wonderful and kids will enjoy the climbing of rocks. This is",
          "Easy access to an elevated view of Phoenix skyline. Superb at sunset, but it can get crowded. Might want to wrap visit around a wine and cheese Al frescoe in the park.",
          "Fun, easy family-friendly walk to the top with great views of Phoenix, the airport, and Papago mountains.",
          "I was looking for something to do that was active but not too strenuous after a long flight into Phoenix and this short hike and lovely park was perfect. I travelled with a large group of teen girls and parents for a volleyball tournament in Glendale over the President's Day",
          "I hesitate to call this a \"hike\" as we literally parked and were at the top in under 10 min. I would say this is a great add-on to a trip to the zoo or gardens, not sure it would be worth driving there for just that. That said - cool rock formation, neat picture opportunity,",
          "It's across from the Phoenix Zoo so I went there. There were a lot of drunk people acting really stupid so I left and wet to the zoo. It's nothing special.",
          "Words can't explain how beautiful this rock is. We just missed the sunset we couldn't get up there fast enough to see it but if you're in the area it's a must see. I even came back to it the next day so we could see in the day light probably one of my favorite part of this trip.",
          "We visited the hole in the rock when we had time to kill before our plane took off. The hole in the rock itself was okay. Calling it a hike to the rock would only be true for small children. It's right by the parking lot. It was busy when we were there and a woman wanted to take",
          "We saw a picture of this place while searching for places to visit around Phoenix so we decided to visit it. From the parking lot, it was a short and leisure walk to the top. It was not hard at all. Once reaching to the hole, one could feel the breeze blowing through the hole.",
          "We took our children (4, 7, & 9) on thos short hike. They loved climbing up the rocks and going through the hole in the rock! No complaining here! My oldest did slip and fall on the way down (and skinned his knee), but he was not being careful. Overall, it was a great experience!",
          "The title really explains it all, its not an over the top amazing natural landmark but it is at least a cool place to take a picture and gather a view of phoenix. I definitely wouldn't plan a trip around this, only stop by if your in the area. If you would like a good view of",
          "Very popular attraction, easy hike hardest part was avoiding the crowd! The views from the hole was worth it. Didn't stay long due to the amount of people.",
          "This outlook is a easy climb with a reward at the top. Fun photography if you can get around the crowds. It may have simply been we were there the day after the PGA tournament ended and it is less crowded other days. There is an opportunity to easily combine this with a visit",
          "If you are near Papago Park (Desert Botanical Garden, Phoenix Zoo, or using the park itself) this is a fun little detour. Very short trail, but a little steep in places. Nice view from the \"hole\", a shady place to rest and take some pictures before your descent.",
          "Unique views from the hole after a short uphill hike. This hike still requires some effort, but in all, very easy. The access through the hole requires some physical agility, but steps have been \"built in\" so most can easily get up and thorough. You get some nice views of parts",
          "This place was CROWDED with small children. It's super hot if you pick the wrong time of day, the view was very underwhelming, and it's difficult to park because of the zoo. Unless you are just trying to kill time on your way to the airport, I wouldn't recommend this.",
          "This rock in the middle of town is easy to hike if you aren't in shape to do Camel Back. Great views of the park and city of Phoenix below from the opening. Well worth the stop night or day. Sunsets would be amazing from the hole.",
          "This was an easy hike even on a hot day. Views at the top are very good. Not very many people which was nice. Good quick activity for anyone.",
          "We were going an ASU baseball game and this was quite close. We made a quick stop before the game (on a Thursday around 5pm) and it was worth it. It's just a few minutes walk and it really is beautiful with a super view of the cityl. It was busy, but not so busy we couldn't get",
          "The boys love climbing up and going thru the hole in the rock, they have picnic tables, if your in the mind for lunch after the hike it's there. Because we re in Arizona, water, water, and good hiking shoes a must, no matter what trail you take.",
          "Located right across from the Botanic Garden, this is a great place to stretch your legs, climb on some big bald rocks, and take in the view.",
          "Short and easy climb and the views are wonderful. By short I mean 5-10 minutes. Seems a little adventurous at first, but it's actually an easy step through the hole in the rock. DO IT! You'll be glad you did.",
          "This is a nice little park area to a walk, hike or to climb up to the hole in the rock. Parking is limited but worth the wait for a parking spot.",
          "This is a nice way to spend a half hour or so. Short climb to the \"hole\" and nice view to look out but not really much to \"do\" once you've climbed up and looked out. Nice that you can park very close (but limited parking so get there early in the day, it was pretty quiet before",
          "Exceptional rock formation in mids of a nice park. Worth a visit and a small climb into the hole. Ample parking.",
          "After visiting the zoo my friend took me to the Hole in the Rock. It was a short walk/climb up the back of the rock and down into the hole. My legs were pretty sore from running the marathon the day before but I was still able to handle the climbing so I'd say it wasn't too",
          "The hike is easy, the view amazing, and the erosion of the rock has made it an exciting area to explore.",
          "This was a short easy hike going up the back side. Kids had a ball climbing around and there are additional places to hike close by.",
          "Hole in the Rock is nothing to write home about, but if you are in Phoenix with a little spare time on your hands, go and do it!! A little (Very short...) hike, a little climb, and you get to the Hole. Views of phoenix are neat. Pretty little attraction.......",
          "Went up with out-of-town guests. It seems like it could be boring--I mean, it's a hole in the rock--but it's actually kind of cool. Nice view of the airport and downtown. Decent photo op. You need to be slightly nimble (but only slightly) to move around, and I was slightly",
          "A wonderful place to visit that gives you an opportunity to see wildlife in the middles of the city.",
          "Just not a s dramatic as it is portrayed!A very long walk to basically see nothing. if it weren't for the other rock features in the area , this hike would be a bust.",
          "If you can find an open parking place in the nearest lot, it's not a far walk, but there is a bit of climbing (wear good shoes, not flip-flops). It was somewhat busy in the middle of a weekday, so I would recommend avoiding weekends if possible if you don't like crowds. I",

          "Papago Park, one of Phoenix's premier city parks, is in the desert between the botanical gardens and the zoo. There's an easy trail up the back of a butte (small mountain) to Hole in the Rock, a formation that let's you look out into the valley below. More adventurous or",
          "We loved Hole in the Rock! Breathtaking scenery. Hike was easy & short. Kids loved climbing all around the rock. Easy access from parking lot. Restrooms nearby. Near other attractions.",
          "It's just a short easy hike up the back of this rock for a great view of Phoenix from one side and Tempe from the other. Good picture taking spot",
          "What a fun spot to visit. It's right by the Phoenix zoo, so if you are going there, consider a little side trip to visit. This is a short and easy hike with great views of Papago Park, the Phoenix skyline and Hunt's Tomb. Also a great place to take out of town visitors.",
          "This is an easier climb than it looks. I'm from the East coast and not used to rocky surfaces and I still made it up in a few minutes. Lots of fun. Really nice people hanging out in the hole. Great place for travel pics.",
          "If you like to hike and enjoy seeing unique vistas that earth has to offer than \"Hole in the Rock\" is for you. A simple 5 minute hike and your are on top of the rock and have an amazing view of Phoenix. Total time needed is 30 minutes to an hour...depending on how much time",

          "This place is cool. It offers a great photo opportunity, and it's a very short hike. There also is plenty of parking. Check it out.",
          "This is a great hiking spot, and because of its location offers a beautiful view of the area. The rock is rather porous, so it really grabs your shoes, giving a sense of sure footing. Close to the city, very accessible.",
          "Spent a couple of hours here, sand stone rock formation with a nature hole in the rock. A little difficult of a climb up the rock but well worth the time",
          "This was a short and easy hike but we went right before sunset which was a huge mistake (happened to be when we got there, not planned). At sunset this place is packed as people like to watch the sun hit the horizon. There is no place to sit and it's too busy to get a photo in",
          "Honestly wasn't expecting it to be as cool as it was. Short few min walk around the rock and to the top through the back side. The hole in quiet large! We went at about 8am and it was empty .I recommend you do the same! Great place to just sit and relax for a few minutes and",
          "This is a must see if you are visiting us here in Phoenix. It has some unusual rock formations and a lot of wild life to check out. Enjoy the day at this awesome park.",

          "I don't want to be that guy, who puts in negative reviews, but. This is a rock, with a hole in it. Boring. The zoo is close though. My kids ran around for a few minutes and liked to be the one in the hole. They got real bored real quick too. So many other cool things to do in",
          "Had a great day in the afternoon visiting the Phoenix Zoo ......One of the Largest and cleanest that I have ever been to...Coming from New York and having been to the Bronx Zoo growing up there is no comparison.....Sorry New York....Phoenix has you beat in all areas....off to",
          "A great experience! You drive to the parking lot and walk to the \"back\" and then climb up, using some built in stairs and some natural terrain. It is not a long climb to the hole, where you can climb through and find an area to sit and watch a beautiful sunset. If you are",
          "Went for my son's school activity and we had a lot of fun. Okay for those who have food allergies, since you bring your own food.",
          "We did this as short stop in papago park after the dbg. Trail in back is easy to follow includes steps. We enjoyed the views and the cool feeling of how high up we looked from the parking lot while it was just a short walk.",
          "For a VERY quick Arizona outdoor walking experience for ALL ages that is central to the Phoenix area, this is great. Even very close to the airport, and right by the Zoo and Botanical Garden so can be combined with them. For a bit more walking, right across the Galvin Pky are",
          "The hole in the rock is a quick 10-minute climb from the parking lot. It is well worth the climb as it offers gorgeous views of Phoenix and the surrounding area. If you are so equipped (good climbing shoes and comfortable clothes) you can get a more challenging climb in going",

          "The Hole in the Rock is very popular. This leads to congestion in the parking lot and on the trails and formations. There are definitely better times than others to go. To the best of our knowledge, there are no bathrooms here. There was a water fountain by the parking lot.",
          "Gorgeous natural geological formation, but it was incredibly crowded when we went, which took away from the experience. I couldn't even get back over to the other side of the hole easily because there were so many people coming through. On the up side, the walk up is pretty",
          "We went here to enjoy a little fresh air and had a great time even though it was a little busy. If you have young kids to teenagers they will probably enjoy being able to climb around on the rocks while older adults will enjoy the view of the Phoenix skyline. The walk is",
          "It was a cloudy day and my husband and I wanted to get out and do something. I had just seen reviews on the Hole in the Rock and thought geez...let's go check it out. It was a gorgeous day and we climbed the easy route by going the back way. We had brought our dogs with us",

          "We could see this place from a distance but our GPS had a hard time finding it. If you remember that it abutts the parking lot of the zoo, you will not have any difficulty finding it. The hill is made of some type of sandstone that has been eroded over the years. You can see",
          "We had some time before we had to head off to the airport. We went to Hole in the Rock. It was a great way to end off our vacation. We got some good pictures, climbed on some rock, and saw the sunset. If in the area and have some time, stop by.",

          "The Hole in the Rock archaeological site is a great add on attraction to do with either the zoo or the botanical gardens as they are very close to each other. The site was pretty busy with people but still easily accessible. A path goes up and around the back access the \"hole\"",

          "When visiting Phoenix it is worth visiting the hole in the rock. On the backside is an easy way to get up, some more adventurous people can go up the way in front of the parking lot. If you decide to go all the way up to the top you got to be very cautious and should wear some",
          "We saw everyone was standing on the top of the rock and thinking how I get up there. It turn out was not hard at all. I had the best walk up on the top and got to see the view from the hole which very amazing. This is a must do visit when you are in phoenix.",
          "This was a gentle hike. A 7 year old was with us and she made it fairly easily. Very interesting topography and great view from the top.",
          "It was an easy hike up to the hole if you follow the path that winds around the mountain. It took about 6 minutes to walk up to the hole. You get a good view from up there of the Phoenix area. Parking was really easy there since there were not many there the day we went.",
          "Visiting fro Chicago, my son's wife had mentioned about going here. Nice hike, neat view. Something you don't experience every day. Glad we took the time to hike up there. A must stop if you are in the area.",
          "A short and fairly easy climb up with a clear trail to get to the top - can be a bit tough and umcomfortable to climb midday in the summer months when its very hot! Such a beautiful view of phoenix and the desert landscape when you get up there!",
          "From the hole you can see a beautiful sunset and have a broad view of the city. Great for pictures, very easy to reach the top, you don't need any physical preparation to do it, the parking lot is extremely close. It may wind a little bit inside, if it's cold make sure you bring",

          "I been hiking hole in the rock since 2009. I still enjoy it today. One of my favorite experiences is being at the top just at sunrise. I recommend it to my friends visiting phoenix for first time to swing by hole in the rock even if just for 20 minute hike up and back.",
          "Hole in the rock has a unique history and is an easy, short trail to navigate. We saw people with small children, elderly and everyone in between at this site. However, it is not a paved path (so leave strollers in the car), there are a few stairs to climb and you need to be",

          "Hole in the Rock is a formation located in Papago Park. After driving the loop around the park with various parking options by the lake, the picnic spots, and the restrooms, you can leave your vehicle right at the base of the trail. The 10-15 minute hike curves around the rock",

          "Very easy and beautiful hike. Great just to kill some time and it's free. There is a relatively easy trail up the back. Some people were scaling the hill in the front but that looked a little too dangerous.",
          "It's free! Easy parking. Easy flat walk to the rock. Easy to walk up. Fun spot for pictures. The teenagers really liked it. Definitely worth a visit.",

          "You make your way up the back path and come into a hollowed out stone. You can sit in naturally made rock seats, have a picnic lunch or pop open a bottle of wine. Best time is at sunset. Only draw back is the planes - you're close to the air port",

It is a bit crowded, but if you're willing to climb above the hole then you'll get away from the majority. Please only do this if you're comfortable with some rock climbing. These photos were taken with my phone in October.",
          "Land Mark's are interesting to some, I am part of that some.",
          "I had not big expectations with this place. And it surprised me completely. It's a \"small\" mountain that you can climb very easy but that's what's make it more beautiful. The view is fantastic and the desert landscape is mesmerizing. Don't \u2026",
          "Great place to see. I even faced my fear of heights and went to the top of the rock",

          "During peak hours (around 10a - 3p) parking can be difficult. You may need to park some distance away then walk. But, the walk is easy and comfortable, and the short 3-5 minute hike to the top is easy enough for children to ascend. Once there you'll be rewarded with a nice view!",

          "If you\u2019re looking to get outdoors and take in some Arizona scenery but aren\u2019t big into hiking, this is the spot for you. The hike to the top of the rock is maybe 10 minutes from the parking lot. The path is clearly marked and safe to travel \u2026",
          "I'm overweight.  At first I was going to sit it out.  People were very patient and it wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be.  Once you get to the hole in the rock, you realize it's all worth the aches and the pains.",

          "The perfect spot to watch the sunset. A bit of a climb up though but easy enough.",
          "Driving up to this area is breathtaking. It takes less than 10 minutes to walk around the back (you can walk around from either side) and up to the hole. The view wasn\u2019t as stunning as I thought it would be but it is still pretty and seems \u2026",
          "This is a good-quick site to see.  Its not some big adventure, nor is it a long intense hike.  Its not something that will fill an entire day either, but its a good place to take out of town guests for a quick and unique view of the city. \u2026",
          "Wow! What a view! Loved climbing this rock. It's super easy to walk up. You'll get to the top within 5-7 minutes. Definitely worth it!",

It\u2019s a very short climb to the top, but a nice view of downtown Phoenix, especially at sunset! It was a little crowded and must have been a popular spot in the Tempe area, but was otherwise a great spot.",
          "Its a beautiful place to hike are to relax and enjoy the peaceful environment",
          "Easy hike. Pretty cool view of Tempe and Phoenix once you're at the top.",

          "This is one of my most highly recommended tourist attractions. It's free, fun, and after hiking for a few minutes you get to a beautiful place to take pictures of the whole city. Make sure you climb thru the hole in the rock! Also make sure \u2026",

          "Really beautiful place",
          "Good place to visit with family and friends. Kid friendly, pet friendly small hike. There are ramadas near the areas and can be a picnic place.\n  There are no restaurants or any kind of outlets near by so carry food and water.  Phoenix zoo is right adjacent to this place so you have some traffic in the same direction.",
          "In less than 10 min you can walk around the back and into the hole in the rock site. It's a very cool little place to visit. There is a great view and a small little parking lot.

          "It's beautiful with great view of zoo and city",
          "I climbed a mountain! It was a great walk around and then up the backside to the top! Make sure you wear your tennis shoes or shoes with good grip because going down was a little tricky but definitely do-able even for me who's far from being in the best shape!",
          "Nice, easy hike. Good for kids. Watch them near the edge! Nice views. Often crowded.",
          "Recommend for an easy walk up a mountain to take beautiful photos.  I was able to take children and older adults with ease.  There are other more experienced trails for hikers but our family just wanted an easy walk",

          "Awesome place to visit, a lot of nice rock formations to climb. Unfortunately it is very close to a military base and the airport so flying drones is out of the question..... Unless you're sneaky \ud83d\ude09. Lots of nice paths, nothing strenuous, good for all ages",
          "This is a little hike with great views. Lots of places to take pictures but it was pretty crowded. We took a toddler and my parents who are in their 60\u2019s and the hike was no problem. We had to watch the toddler close because some areas were steep once we got to the top.",
          "so much fun! I was in Phoenix for a work conference, and last minute, my team decided to go see \"the hole.\" Me and the other two girls I was with were in heels!!! But we still made it up and down alive - so the hike up isn't too bad at all. View was worth it, loved the view post-sunset with all the city lights too \ud83e\udd29",

          "Something different and also nice views",
          "It is what it says, but the view is worth the stop to stretch your legs and snag a pic.  I enjoyed seeing all the different cacti in one area.  Be careful of bees along the walk, but there are several signs warning of this along the way. \u2026",
          "This is a pretty good beginner hike. Going downhill from the hole, it does there are like 3 steep steps, but after that it's smooth sailing. I guess I might be spoiled from the other hiking spots, so this one didn't seem as special. It's \u2026",

          "Cool spot for a quick hike and a cool view",

        "wiki": "The Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) is located in Phoenix, Arizona. Opened in April 2010, it is the largest museum of its type in the world. The collection of over 15,000 musical instruments and associated objects includes examples from nearly 200 countries and territories, representing every inhabited continent. Some larger countries such as the United States, Mexico, India, China, and Brazil have multiple displays with subsections for different types of ethnic, folk, and tribal music.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n \nThe Museum was founded by Robert J. Ulrich, former CEO and chairman of Target Corporation. A collector of African art and a world museum enthusiast, Ulrich and his friend Marc Felix originated the idea after a visit to the Musical Instrument Museum in Brussels, Belgium. The design of the museum benefited as well from the consultation of the Mus\u00e9e de la Musique in Paris modernised in 1997.The contemporary building covers approximately 200,000 square-feet, with two floors of galleries. The museum was built at a cost of over US$250 million. The exhibit for each country features a flat-screen high-resolution video showing local musicians performing on native instruments. Visitors can listen to the performances through a wireless device with headphones that is activated automatically when an exhibit is being observed.\nThe facility contains a 299-seat theater for concerts, which are held primarily after regular hours.

          "We missed this special place for several years as the thought of this specialty museum did not appeal. How wrong was this! Ended up with two full days and still 1/3 to explore. The video clips of all the instuments and performers number over 1200. Every internationally known",

          "Going to the MIM is always a great experience. The venue is better than any Vegas venue. I love the intimacy it has to offer. As Jim Brickman stated \"it's like being at a party at someone's home.\" The concert was a bit disappointing for me. I felt there was too much Christmas",
          "This is a fun place for young and old. Interactive displays are great. Great history of music. Highly recommended.",

          "If you love music, any kind of music, you'll be enthralled by this one. And I don't say that lightly. Even if you know very little about music, your imagination and your mind will thank you for the adventure and stimulation. The food wasn't bad either.",
          "You can actually hear the instruments by listening with their audio devices at monitors throughout the halls. Can be overwhelming. Wish there were some more variety with the instruments shown--but I expect that to change over time as they are a fairly new museum.",

          "There's just too much to see here. Pace yourself. Avoid any special exhibits, time is better spent on the main ones. The one hour orientation tour was good in giving a sense of what all there is. Don't miss the sound machine demos at noon or 3pm. Cafe is decent.",

          "I\u2019m not into music, but this place is absolutely captivating. Interestingly, Phoenix is singularly chockablock with immersive art experiences: MIM, Yayoi Kusama\u2019s Fireflies at Phoenix Art Museum, and Wonderspaces. This one, however, is so extensive it\u2019s really a two day",
          "Can't believe I had not heard of this place before. Beautiful, well designed building. The self guiding tour was exceptional, letting you hear the music of the countries and people shown in the displays. I've never seen so many instruments from so many different places. Lots of",

          "We visited the Museum while in town visiting a friend. Don't pass up the headphones - they really make the visit comprehensive as there is a video with sound at just about every display. The array of musical instruments is really amazing, and they are organized geographically",
          "This is a wonderful museum, and the audio headsets add a tremendous amount to the experience. In contrast to the headsets at many other museums, you do not have to enter a numeric code each time you wish to hear the audio track that is intended to accompany a given display.",
          "There is so much to see at this wonderful museum, with musical instruments from all around the world and performances shown on TV screens that show those instruments being played. I've been to many museums which provide you with a headset (often charging extra for it), and then",

          "We had been told that this museum shouldn\u2019t be missed although I don\u2019t have any musical talent and couldn\u2019t see how instruments would interest me. How wrong was I, this is without doubt one of the most interesting museums I have ever visited and I am a museum freak. The",

          "Not only is it a wonderful Museum, but a very good place to eat. Do take a tour if it is available and then walk around on your own. I have friends that have visited at least once a year for the past 3 years. Finally got them to visit and had a hard time to get them to leave!!",
          "We had musician friends visiting from Chicago and we decided to visit the MIM. We received headphones which plays information from each exhibit and we were very interested to learn about musical instruments from around the world as well as famous artists. There were instruments",

          "I didn't expect to be blown away by MIM but I was. I'm not musical and can't play an instrument. Maybe because of that I never really thought about or comprehend the huge part music plays in all cultures AND how neighboring countries flavor of music influences and shapes each",
          "We were very surprised at the quality and size of this museum. We went because of all the great reviews, but far and away this blew our minds!!",
          "We are so glad we took others advice and visited this museum. Amazing how musical instruments have evolved over generations from an animal skin stretched over a gourd to some of today's more complex instruments. It illustrates how man's need for music permeates all societies.",
          "The MIM is a surprising museum that had way more than I initially thought it would. The history withing the instruments and the exhibits are interesting and you can spend hours without even realizing it. This is definitely an all day trip and is perfect for an indoor activity.",
          "Amazing tour through the cultural souls of countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, South America and the US. Videos and texts were amazing! Worth spending the whole day!",
          "This is a fantastic experience for young or old. Our family of 3 ( 8 year old and mid-forties) really enjoyed this. This is more like a musical experience than a museum. You are given a headset that interacts with each of the music stations. Our daughter enjoyed the rooms",
          "This is an awesome experience, enjoyable by pretty much everyone. It's so much more than just musical instruments - it's also dance and costumes and foreign cultures. You see how music is intertwined with people's lives regardless of the continent they live on. The exhibition",

          "MIM is a museum for all ages. Everyone will find something they enjoy. We have been 3 times with various friends and we all felt we wish we had set aside more time to visit. There is a performer oriented section (think Taylor Swift, Johnny Cash, Elvis, etc), a genre oriented",
          "I have to admit that when I saw the #1 thing on TA in Phoenix was this museum, I was skeptical. My son loves music through band, but he must have gotten a recessive gene. I enjoy music, but figured the day was for him. Boy was I wrong. This place is so well done. The",

          "My family and I came here on vacation at the request of my brother. He is a band instructor and musician, so he was dying to come here when he heard about it. I found this place to be fascinating. The exhibits took us through the history of music for countries from all around",
          "Great one of a kind musical instrument collection displayed perfically. Great helpfully staff of mostly volunteers. You get a headset for the tour so as you move from exibate to exibate you listen to the sounds of the various instruments and cultures. Don't miss the cafe it's",
          "After reading others\u2019 reviews, my expectations were pretty high and, after I spent the day at MIM, I was in awe of everything it has to offer. The interactive experiences of not only viewing real musical instruments from all over the world, but being able to watch and listen to",
          "OK, so in early October we visited Scottsdale, and were a bit dubious and yet intrigued enough that we decided to give the Musical Instrument Museum a quick look. We\u2019re oh so glad we did. First of all, there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cquick look\u201d here. This place will entice you,",
          "I went by myself and had a blast. I play a few instruments and was excited to see that they had an exhibit with fully functional interactive instruments. I was blown away to see that among those instruments they had two harps. I spent about three hours total, split into two",
          "So many exhibits that were well laid out and paired with music videos we could hear through our headsets. We only got through a very small portion of the museum, so will have to travel back to Phoenix another time to see more.",

          "Found this place on TripAdvisor while looking for something to do before a late afternoon flight. We have been to smaller musical instrument museums in Michigan and Germany, but neither compared to the size of this one. Very interesting place to learn about old instruments,",
          "This was once a private collection - which blossomed into a full-blown museum. Instruments from all over the world - unique instruments like Elvis's Martin D38, John Lennon's piano and memorabilia from many of the world's greatest musicians. A mini-workshop of the Martin Guitar",
          "This is one of the most amazing museums you will ever visit. Something for people of all ages. We send all of our company there, and each time they rave about their experience. Don\u2019t plan on a quick in and out. Too much to see and experience.",
          "My cousin both a musician and a world traveler BUT not a museum person so he wasn\u2019t really interested in going. BUT he went and LOVED it and wish he could have spent a second day there! Plan to be there as long as you possibly can! It\u2019s wonderful.......and reasonably priced",
          "We have visited this museum twice and each time we had to leave without seeing everything we would have liked to see. If you want to cover the entire museum you should plan on a really full day or spread it over two days. There are so many different instruments and types of",
          "I thought this may be a nice way to spend part of an afternoon but it was so much more. It was fascinating to learn about all the instruments used throughout the world. I t was also like a mini geography lesson as well. The The downstairs artists, mechanical room and demo rooms",
          "Being new to the Phoenix area, I was looking for someplace to explore, and this seemed like a good place to start. I expected some small, dusty museum that would be pretty empty of people. Boy was I was wrong. It's spectacular, modern museum (Smithsonian quality) that is",
          "My wife has dragged me literally around the world visiting museums. Now I like art and design probably more than the next guy but usually I burn out pretty quick. That was until I visited the Musical Instrument Museum. This is without a doubt the greatest museum ever made",
          "Great museum with so many interesting instruments. Everything is laid out nicely with plenty of space. Allow at least a couple of hours to see everything.",
          "We've attended four concerts in the past year here. There is no bad seat in the best-in-class acoustic concert hall at the MIM. Whatever your musical taste, MIM theater will become your favorite place to listen and SEE musical talent. The intimacy of this music hall makes you",

          "It's an amazing museum. Something you would see in NYC. I couldn't believe that this museum it a hidden treasure in AZ. So glad we found it. Will definitely go again.",
          "Some of our out of town friends visited this first and then a year later they went again with us after they had already highly recommended it to us initially. My wife and I ended up going a second time the following year. It is amazing with the museum showing the development",
          "Every concert I've seen here was amazing. I've seen individual performers as well as groups and they were all great.",
          "I think every instrument ever known to man is on exhibit here. It is well organized, well planned out and meticulously documented. So much so that it can be overwhelming. If you are a musician or a music scholar this will be heaven. It is hard to take in in one visit.",

          "Visited the museum with our nephews and quite frankly, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it. Boy was I wrong. It is an amazing place and came across almost like a history of the world. It appeared as if every musical instrument was exhibited and every type of music was demonstrated.",

          "This place is gigantic and you probably need 2 days to see all of it. The mechanical instruments exhibit and the artist ones are awesome. Playing different instruments was really fun too. The way they have the audio system set up is so cool all you need to do is walk by an",
          "Wow! I knew going into this I would enjoy it because I\u2019m a musician. My wife, who isn\u2019t, accommodated me to the MIM. She was the one who didn\u2019t want to leave! We looked at our watch and three hours had gone by! It was amazingly curated and the layout of the museum was",

          "When visiting Scottsdale with a group of friends, we spent an entire day at the MIM. Everyone except our youngest member (mid-30s) LOVED the museum. The exhibits are on two floors, with the upstairs galleries grouped by region and country. We spent the vast majority of our time",

          "My favorite museum -- EVER. Feels like you going around the world and experiencing every culture in fast forward. I think you really need three days to do all the exhibits justice.",
          "If you truly love music and different ways that it can be made, this is a must see. Spent over three hours there and did not see all I would have liked. (Go with someone who will take there time to explore) Could have easily spent another \u2026",
          "Great museum. Wasn't that excited about going to the museum, but really enjoyed it. Lots of interesting old instruments and lots of good music to listen to. Plan to spend at least 4 hours if you want to see everything.",
          "A friend told me that there's no such thing as a bad seat here. They were completely right! Soundstage is amazing... I'll be coming back often.",
          "Told about it last trip to Phoenix. Wish my hip was better. Could have spent 5-6 hours there. Superb!",
          "Fascinating place.   Could have spent a lot more time there.   The cafe is good enough to be a destination location",
          "WHAT A MUSEUM! There is a massive array of instruments that are from ALL parts of the world. The headsets play automatically when you walk up to the TVs and you can play and interact with many of the instruments. Theres a STEINWAY piano at the entrance that you can play.",
          "This is a fantastic place for music lovers.   Such amazing history and an incredible venue for concerts.",
          "One of the most incredible museums in the world. Highly recommend spending a whole day here. And if you have the opportunity, see a concert in their intimate concert hall. The acoustics are amazing.",
          "I am only taking a star off because this is not kid friendly. Maybe if your kids are 10 and up. I\u2019m a mom of 3, veteran museum goer and this was not in any way a fun or very interactive experience for my kids (8, 7 and 2). After a short \u2026",
          "This place is big, so bring walking shoes. Spent hours looking at instruments from all over the world. This is a place for people who appreciate instruments and the history of music.",
          "One of the best museums of any type I've every visited...spend a couple of days there!",
          "Love the MIM! I felt like I traveled the world! Great location and so much to see and do. Entertaining for all ages.",
          "Amazing place! Today was \"Experience The Andes\"  day with live music by groups from South America, and dance workshops too! This all in addition to the great displays of musical instruments from all over the world. Definitely a must see place.",
          "Well organized and I really like the self tour system they have. It was cool to get to hear so many different instruments from throughout the world.",
          "We were here for 5 hours and still didn't see everything! Certainly something for everybody and to top it off, the food at the cafe is worth stopping for lunch. Can't wait until I have the chance to return and see the rest of the exhibits!",
          "Great place! The best museum I've ever been to (probably because I love music, culture and geography), and one of the most innovative with its use of headphones and video.",
          "What an amazing place! I really appreciate that the curators include all countries and regions of the world. Make sure to leave enough time in your day for the gift shop as well!",
          "Its a huge music museum. Beautiful  place and they have live band in the afternoon.  You will pay membership so you can hear all kinds of instrumental music thru head phone  around the world. A lot of people  coming here and they have Foid Court as well.",
          "Thought this was going to be a bust but it was very enjoyable. Great exhibits from around the world includes videos at each presentation. It was a 5 hour event if you take it all in, well worth the price and the stop. Wear comfortable shoes, there is a snack bar and restaurant too.",
          "Overall, experience was good.  Was under the impression that it was a lot more hands on, unfortunately it's not.  Some sound boxes were harder than others to activate.",
          "OMG! This was one of the most interesting, educational, and fascinating places/museums I have ever been in.\nInstruments from every country. Video clips which let you hear many if them being played.\nThe juxtaposition of the various regions \u2026",
          "A gift to the desert. Saw Steve Gadd band. Exceptional music. One of the greatest music venues in America",
          "So much to see and hear! Music and  instruments from every \n culture. Quite amazing.",
          "The only thing stopping this being a 5 star is how vast the collection is and as a result kind of get burnt out looking at it all.  We learned a lot from this museum and really liked the layout.",
          "So awesome I decided to become a member. Interactive experience. One can simply lose oneself in there.",
          "This is one of the best museums I have ever seen. They have a huge collection of musical talent from around the world. Definitely worth to spend few hours here!",
          "This was MUCH bigger than I expected.  It is a top-notch museum, too.  The facility also has a cafeteria that serves during lunch hours.  The museum tour itself is self guided.  You are provided a listening device/headphones that activate \u2026",
          "If your in the Phoenix area and are a music enthusiast it is well worth a visit. One of the top five in the country.",
          "MIM is well done, and well put together... $27 for a day pass and a pass to get into the special display (per person). Seemed appropriate.  We were there 5 hours, and ended up hustling through the last 1/2 of the museum... Really alot to \u2026",
          "Excellent museum and cafe. Would suggest they have an outside waiting area sheltered from the rain.",
          "This place really exceeded my expectations. You can spend 3+ hours here because theres so much to see. Worth a visit if you have any interest in music from different cultures or playing instruments",
          "One of the most interesting museums I\u2019ve ever visited. Spent 3 hrs there. Not nearly enough.",
          "Love the MIM! Intense, extensive, immaculate and soooo fun.  Where is the piano that John Lennon used to write Imagine?",
          "If you're a music lover (who isnt?) Living anywhere near the valley of the sun, you HAVE to visit this place. The absolute most complete and coolest collection of musical instruments I've ever seen in my life, all presented with an \u2026",
          "Fantastic experience! Would suggest a 2 day pass if you have the time, as even in 6 hours I only got through a little.",
          "Its was a great place for me. They have a room for kids and expensive food. Or you can bring your own lunch. They let you check your bags, if you have water or food. Drinks or food is not allowed in the museum areas.",
          "This is an amazing museum. They have musical instruments from nearly every culture, country and time period, and some from famous musicians as well. If you're really interested, I'd recommend getting the two-day pass. I was there for three \u2026",
          "This is a great museum. The exhibits are organized well and the instruments are displayed beautifully.",
          "Best musical venue in the Valley. The variety of musicians is over the moon. Check it out!",
          "We loved this place! I feel like anyone of all ages would be entertained. We did the self-guided tour with the headphones and it was so fancy. We would totally go again if we had guests visiting.",
          "At the Musical Instrument Museum you will find musical instruments from all four corners of the earth.  This place is absolutely amazing!  The reviews online for this place are in the four point eight star range.  This entire place was recently constructed also.  The people that work here are also as kind as can be.",
          "Beautifully curated musical instruments from around the world primitive to sophisticated, complete with videos and music.",
          "Went to a concert at the Musical Instrument Museum. Since I got there early for the performance, I thought I would look into the museum. Turns out, you have to buy a separate ticket to go into the museum, even if you buy a ticket for the concert.  Guess I'll have to go back another time.",
          "Educational and entertaining multimedia musical exhibits with multiple recordings from every category of musical instruments. Highly Recommend.",
          "Amazing place! Artifacts from all over the world. Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "We had no idea what to expect. It was more than what the website states. We came on Hip Hop weekend and saw breakdancing. We were there till closing. It is so neat how you can go and hear all the different instruments and see the history. \u2026",
          "This is a top-notch museum. There is so much here that there is no way you will see it all in one visit. Pick one or two musical regions you are really interested in learning about and really spend your time there. \n\nThis is also a great \u2026",
          "One of the best concert venues ever. Cannot find fault no matter how hard you look. Snacks are REALLY expensive during intermission... That's OK though. Because the hall and sound are so great you won't care.\n\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",
          "Greatest museum I have ever been too! Went with my husband and we wished we had more time to go through this phenomenal museum!",
          "The museum easily takes a whole day to get through it all with the justice it deserves. You get headsets when you arrive (take your own if you want) and when you stand next to the headset icon at each display, it plays the instruments you \u2026",
          "Very nice history of music around the world.  Would highly recommend a visit.",
          "Music lover or not, this place is amazing! It's interactive, it's not crowded (even on a Saturday during the summer), and it appeals to people of all ages. It is THE largest collection of musical Instruments in the world and the displays \u2026",
          "Went with Ms. Kincaid\u2019s first grade class from Alahambra Madrid (my son is in her class) and had a most excellent experience! Janet our guide was so patient and informative. Looking forward to bringing my family to experience more of this amazing museum!",

          "Perfectly understandable geographic layout. Automatic headphone displays are superb. Definitely warrants more than one visit to appreciate all that is contained therein. Only confusion is why Ginger Baker (who recently died) wasn't listed \u2026",
          "The most incredible musical instrument museum. Huge number of exhibits and very little behind glass. The gift store is worth the trip alone. Allow 2-3 hours.",

          "Totally awesome!!  Loved it. Will definitely go back.",
          "Probably one of the BEST museums I've ever been to. They have arra nged the instruments by continent so start with Asia or Africa first. They cleverly have earphones attached to small Walkman like devices that sense when you are close to an \u2026",
          "This place is very large . With two different floors you will spend over two hours looking at all the different instruments, genres, eras, and cultural styles, and you still won't be able to see it all. There is even an experience room for \u2026",

They have a great little gift shop and a place to eat and relax. We went during the week so it was not too crowded. Definitely recommend.",

The only downside is when the large school groups come in, but they try to reduce the interference,  and I try to support that these young kids get exposed to this musical education.",

          "Perfect for academics and enthusiasts. Top notch collections.  Not that great for kids under 14--only a few hands on exhibits. Plan for two days if you really want an immersive experience.",
          "Very unique,  must see place when in AZ if you like music.",
          "A wonderful experience! I recommend this for all ages. They have done a beautiful job putting this interactive museum together. We were there 4 hrs and still never got to all the countries. Fun and educational!",
          "Amazing museum! So much to see, would definitely recommend spending a whole day here. Many instruments from across the globe and a very fun interactive exhibit.",
          "Fascinating assortment of instruments from all over the world! The audio tour made it more immersive. Some I didn't even know exist. A must go if you're a music/instrument lover. I wish the hip hop section had additional items to see. Facility nice and clean.",
          "There is a ton of stuff to see and a really fun hands on room where you can play the instruments. One could spend all day here listening to each instrument upstairs and watching each video. I have myself. Make sure to sit down and rest \u2026",
          "I could have spent so much more time here than the two hours that we allotted today. This museum is fun, interesting, interactive and suitable for all ages. I highly recommend it! Facilities are in impeccable condition, very handicap accessible.",
          "amazing so much to see. pace yourself.",
          "Love this place! I've been there with my grandkids and their school, also with my husband for the guitar displays.  Great job MIM!",
          "Beautiful building in a nice setting. Easy to get to with ample parking. Affordable admission prices. Interesting exhibits. We visited the Electric Guitar exhibit. Well worth the visit.",
          "What a great museum!  An absolute must for the music lover... But everyone should go at least once in their lifetime!  Get out of the Phoenix heat and listen to GREAT music and learn something. Next time I'm spending the whole day!",
          "We throughly enjoyed our visit and will definitely go back the next time we are in Phoenix. We were there when the special guitar exhibition was going on. It was very interesting and informative. Then we went to see the artist gallery. \u2026",
          "Loved the geographic exhibits and the special exhibit, The Electric Guitar. You need a whole day to fully get the experience!",
          "Fantastic field trip with my students.",
          "Love this place. Beautiful displays and assortment of instruments. Great concerts",
          "Very enjoyable museum. A must for music lovers! I especially like the Appolonia!! Check it out!!",
          "I loved this museum! You wouldn't expect a musical instrument museum to be this expansive, but wow...you could spend hours here. \n\nThe MIM has a collection of instruments from all over the world. In addition, many of the instrument displays \u2026",
          "Fabulous museum with over 10,000 instruments and other artifacts arranged mostly by region and country. Extremely well done video clips allow you to see and hear the music of each country performed. In addition there is a lot of information \u2026",
          "Music lovers or just appreciate the culture of the world, this is the place you want to visit while in Arizona. Its nice place to relax and enjoy. Great place to also bring kids. The facility is super clean, staff are very friendly, helpful and motivated in their work.",
          "Unlike any museum you will ever be in.  Amazing displays...audio and visual.  I am not musical or a big fan of music, but I found this museum fascinating.  Not to be missed.. Great cafe as well.",
          "Such a cool, unique museum! Don't miss it.",
          "Must see when in the Phoenix area. Unbelievable museum of every instrument. I wasn't sure what we would find when we arrived but it was amazing. I would recommend taking 2 days to get the most out of the museum. The cafeteria is overpriced \u2026",
          "A one of a kind world wide musical experience, including an extensive gift shop,  coffee bar and terrific buffet cafe with a wide variety of food, drinks, deserts. Weather permitting you will want to dine in the beautiful outdoor patio \u2026",
          "Too much to see in one day as everyone says. Suggest starting on the second floor. The European room is especially interesting with audio explanations and video demonstrations. The current electric guitar show is great. When your done with that, you still have two thirds of the museum to see. Crowded but manageable on rainy days.",
          "It was very fun the headphones were cool the Experience room was  especially fun I would recommend going.",
          "I loved it and I saw so many things",
          "It was super cold inside the MIM.  Really needed a sweater and I rarely say that.  We had to leave early.  Otherwise, it was an excellent experience.",
          "It covers so many countries that it is overwhelming. That being said, each country, with the possible exception of the US, has a relatively small display which really doesn't do the country justice. Despite this, MIM is absolutely amazing. It shows the music of so many cultures while giving you a geography lesson at the same time.",
          "Unique museum covering the history of musical instruments from all regions of the world.  It's a surprisingly quiet museum as the provided headsets sync with each exhibit as you walk through them.  The first floor exhibit mainly portrays \u2026",
          "One of the best I have been to. Excellent blend of ethnology and musical theory. Audio and video displays greatly enhance understanding.",
          "If you have ever listened to one beat of a drum, one pluck of a string, or one blare of a horn, this is the museum for you. It is simply AMAZING!!! The first floor is dedicated to American music and had a special display on the development \u2026",
          "Great museum and kid friendly.",
          "Whether you're into music or musical instruments or not, you will definitely find something cool here to look and listen to around every corner. The amount of detail that has been taken to curate this place is amazing. The collection is \u2026",
          "Start early - there's too much to see, and hear, in one day.  The quotes in picture 1 say it all.  Don't miss this museum.  It covers the whole world across time with videos and example music for many inatruments, regions and cultures.",
          "Known as one of Phoenix's better sites, the MIM offers regular and excellent shows from artists across the spectrum of music. The theater is large enough for a good sized audience while remaining intimate with easy viewing of the stage. The \u2026",
          "Really interesting and well curated. I would recommend the return visit ticket - there is so much to see and experience here. Best to break it up. Plan  a few 2-3 hour visits. Only improvement would be more seated displays - videos. There \u2026",
          "Really cool and awesome place to visit!!",
          "Awesome place. Super fun to spend a day on the weekend at. Lots of instruments and very educational. Over all a great place",
          "A MUST SEE!!! We went to a concert and loved it. 300 seats in the auditorium so it is very intimate. We only saw a small portion of the museum since the concert was after regular hours. But what we saw was just amazing and will be going back. The landscaping outside is gorgeous as well, worth a walk around before going in.",
          "Best museum in Phoenix. Tons of exhibits that are well organized and have lots of information that's easy to digest. If you're a big music or history fan then pan on spending at least 3 hours here. They have traveling exhibitions that are \u2026",
          "Awesome collection of instruments from all over the world.   Well worth the visit!",
          "I say something new every time I go amazing takes at least 3 and 1/2 to 4 hours to go through, recommended for all",
          "This is a local treasure. Incredible collectionn and special exhibits. Best place for live jazz concerts.",
          "Very unique place , worthy of checking out",
          "Great world class destination spot. Thought it was going to be just a display of instruments, but there were state of the art presentations/dioramas by country and culture.  Could not do it all in one afternoon.  You need a week!  Should be on everyone's bucket list, and a fabulous place to take out of town visitors!",
          "Amazing music and instruments from all over the world! Fantastic way to spend an afternoon.",
          "Extremely cool experience for me and my daughter!!",
          "Fantastic instruments displayed beautifully. The staff was somewhat unfriendly.",
          "Music, history, and culture all in one place. The special Electric Guitar exhibit is very well done. But you need to spend the day to experience the entire museum...The artist space and the 2nd floor Music of the Continents are amazing. Well worth your time and money.",
          "Vast collection of musical instruments each with a fascinating storybook tell.",
          "An outstanding experience.  Well worth the admission.  Will be returning.",
          "Amazing learning experience! So many instruments and history!"

          "Been coming for years but was very disappointed this time. The prices were raised to get in and you can no longer feed the fish. There were a lot less fish to see. When we first started going there you could sit on the grass and relax in a beautiful setting. Now you aren\u2019t",

          "Our first day in Phoenix was not what we expected. We wanted to hike at South Mountain Park which lacked unmarked trails, no visitor center & no maps. After climbing to the top (which was worth the drive) we decided to check out the Japanese Friendship Garden. Now, I typically",

          "After reading the review I was disappointed . It is nice but small and nothing that special. The price is high for what it is. Really all you are doing is walking around a pond. Landscape was not as beautiful as expected.",
          "We went here for the first time today and loved it. You can no longer feed the coi due to a problem with pigeons competing for the food and making a mess. Every turn of our walk around the grounds brought a new beauty spot in nature to dwell upon. Lovely and serene. Bring",

          "Over the past few years I shared this spot with family members visiting from out of town. My recommendation is to approach this garden with an objective to slow down, have a seat, and enjoy the moment. This is a beautiful spot near downtown Phoenix. I enjoy eating a snack while",

          "We used a Culture Pass to try this garden out so our visit was free. Otherwise, the fee is minimal to enter. It was a nice cool day for a stroll through the Japanese Gardens. We were welcomed by the kind staff and asked to recycle their brochure if we didn\u2019t want it. We were",

          "A lush green oasis in a dusty desert. This garden s well kept, well stocked and very beautiful. You can actually smell the grass and other flora. The koi are abundant and kids love a good feeding frenzy. There are also elective events hosted here such as yoga, drum circles, tea",

          "Great place to revive a busy soul. I could see myself sitting on one of the benches and reading a novel, or if I were still working bringing a sandwich and eating it here. We brought three children with us on this trip and they did enjoy the fish and watching the tadpoles, but",
          "We really enjoyed strolling the gardens. Huge beautiful koi scattered throughout the lake. Beautiful gardens and statues, create perfect backdrops for photos.",
          "This garden is an oasis in downtown Phoenix. We spent an hour walking it. There is a koi pond with a waterfall and a tea house on the property. It was fun to feed the koi/ducks. Lots of opportunity for photography especially if you like Asian art. This is not a large park",
          "This is a must see in downtown Phoenix. I had company here from New York, and that included their Japanese Foreign exchange student. We all loved every minute of the visit. The grounds are meticulous and well tended to. The Koi fish are in an abundance, and were lovely to look",

          "Small piece of tranquility in Pheonix. This a beautiful garden to walk into after walking around town. Great place for solo walk, or with family. You can buy food to feed the koi(and ducks enjoy it too!) But ,PLEASE do not feed the pigeons that fly in, they are becoming a hazard",
          "Who knew such a lovely garden was in the heart of downtown Phoenix? The Friendship Garden is small, but incredibly peaceful and well maintained. If you go, plan to take some extra cash to drop in the donation box, as this is a small organization that runs and maintains this",
          "We visited the garden on Christmas Eve (Dec. 24). Gift store/ticket staff were friendly & knowledgeable. Tickets were $7/person and food for the koi & ducks was $1/bag. Extremely well maintained garden. Taking the time to wander, sit and observe, and enjoy the park is well",
          "I started coming here in the summer, love feeding koi fish, employees are so, friendly. Just a relaxing place to visit and walk at. I went to a wine in the garden event and it was fun, love the live music and just a great time! If you haven't been here its a great place and you",
          "This garden sits right behind the hotel I stayed at in Hance Park and is a delightful find. It costs $7 to get in but send an extra dollar or two to feed the koi. The garden is small but the map explains about the meanings of some of the different structures. Feeding the koi was",
          "went there in October, it was a hot day. The garden offers a spot of greenery and a small lake/pond. The best feature are the koi fish! those are absolutely stunning... overall feel the cost of the tickets is a bit too much, considering they don't really offer much.",

          "If you want to get away from it all but don't want to travel far, consider this peaceful, lovely garden. The Japanese have a wonderful sensibility on how to use space, and this garden exemplifies the placement, form, and space that have made Japanese gardens renown for their",
          "Personally, I love this garden. It's so nice to have a peaceful Japanese garden in Phoenix. It's downtown, and you can walk there from the light rail or Burton Barr. The people who work there are always so friendly, and the events are really nice. The garden is very well kept.",
          "Classic Japanese Garden in what is becoming Phoenix's Urban walking downtown.Small , but beautifully designed to give a quiet appreciation.",
          "This place is hidden in downtown Phoenix and if you don't know it's here you might pass right by. It is worth a visit to check out the Coi pond and see for yourself. There weren't any flowers, but maybe because we visited in the summer. Which also made it very hot and not a ton",
          "Just north of downtown on third Avenue is a remarkable and peaceful Garden. Although the hours are quite limited during the summer, curator Della has done a wonderful job preserving the space and with pools and appropriate plantings has developed a beautiful environment. It is",
          "The gardens are beautuful. I loved the pond with the fish and the cute baby ducklings. The birds loved the fish food so much that they flew onto my husband and mother-in-law's hands. It was very peaceful and serene in the garden.",
          "Been wanting to go here for a long time and finally made it. Didn't regret it. It's a good place to go alone, but also good to go with family. Trails make it easy to get around with a stroller. You can buy food to feed the koi. Quiet place.",
          "This garden is a hidden gem, so much so, that I missed the entrance and had to drive around the block! The grounds are beautiful. The trees are perfectly manicured. It was fun feeding the numerous koi along the bridge. The tea house is in the perfect, secluded location. There",
          "Hard to believe one is in the middle of the city. Though I was not able to take advantage of them, the park has interesting ongoing activities throughout the year. Shows it is active and not static. Staff seem to really try hard to make it memorable. Enjoyed the shade !",
          "Great place to meditate,relax and be inspired. We had a few hours before we could check into our hotel so this was a great way to spend the time. Great place if you have little ones, they will enjoy feeding the koi.",
          "This is the place to go when you need to get away from stress and immerse yourself in the beauty of nature!",
          "This is a nice garden. What makes it unique is it's location here in hot Phoenix. I checked it off my list of things to see, but wouldn't go again. It's just not that memorable.",
          "Wow! A wonderful garden . Relax , enjoy and take in all the beauty that is displayed! You can do a return visit here also and still find something new . This is an exceptional peaceful , relaxing garden and one that should not be overlooked . A fantastic way to enjoy a day.",
          "Very, very small, and smack-dab in the middle of downtown. It's not as tranquil as I had hoped it would be. Very few flowers. The only part I really enjoyed was feeding the koi fish and ducks.",
          "What a beautiful, relaxing spot! For a modest fee, we were able to walk thru a beautiful park setting with a lake filled with Koi, ducks, & swans. Waterfalls, statues, flora, grasses, and park benches made it easy to \"mellow out\" . When in downtown Phoenix, take time to enjoy",
          "Extremely small park. And just that only a park! No indication of any special flora. The Koi pond was stocked with hungry fish and the only source of viewing entertainment. A waste of money and can only advise others to forget it!",
          "This Friendship garden, meant to commemorate the relationship between Phoenix and its sister city in Japan, is rather small. The main feature is a good sized pond loaded with Koi. Many children and some adults feed the Koi with food purchased where you enter the garden and pay",
          "As an avid gardener, I am shocked that the garden is not really touted by the tourist bureau as \"top rated site\" to visit in Phoenix. We had to \"stumble\" across it and it is tough to find by car--lots of one way streets and confusing repair work. But, find it we did, and we",
          "This is a great little garden, in a great little neighbourhood. Away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. The fish and ducks provide the entertainment. There is also a tea house (it was not open the weekend we visited). The gift shop is really nice. All in all the garden",
          "we always try to visit Japanese Gardens when traveling. this one might be the smallest we have visited. It was well laid out, lots of foliage and vegetation. water features were very nice. in all it was a nice relaxing spot, a place to escape the angst of every day life. we",
          "Perfect for relaxation and contemplation. Quiet, well laid out, everything one would want in a Japanese garden.",
          "Nice places to walk and sit. Beautiful landscaping. This Friendship Garden is a beautiful gift to Phoenix.",
          "We have been to couple of Japanese gardens and found them to be quiet and tranquil and an excellent place for meditation and reflection This garden was no exception and was nicely laid out and tranquil. Plan to spend about an hour to walk through and enjoy the garden There",
          "I spent a warm afternoon touring the gardens. They were well done and fascinating, but lacked the color I expect from an urban garden in may.",
          "Great place to stroll around and be in contact with nature. The place is well maintained very clean and free of noise.",
          "I had a very pleasant experience at the Japanese Friendship Garden. I enjoyed the peace, tranquility, and beauty of the garden. I bought some food in the gift shop for the koi fish and ducks. They were all hungry and ate the food quickly. There were many pretty pigeons in",
          "This place is wonderful and very beautiful. My kids loved feeding the huge Koi fish and very affordable. I wish only the Japanese tea house was open to public too. Only used for parties who pay an additional $35pp\ud83d\ude44 Other then that a great way to spend an hour.",
          "My wife and I visited in December 2016. The construction that other reviewers mentioned is complete, and the garden is a beauty. We loved it all... pond, waterfall, lawn, bridge. They were aerating the pond when we were there, so there were a few small air compressors scatted",
          "This is hidden and a secret to many who live here. I discovered it a few years ago initially and have been spreading the word. A group of friends celebrated my birthday here with an intimate japanese Tea Ceremony in which you make reservations for. It was lovely and special!",
          "We stumbled upon this little garden by accident. It was quite lovely and relaxing. Debra went out of her way to teach us about the intricacies of the garden. Make sure to buy fish food to feed the koi!",
          "Just ok. Tea house closed to visitors without a reservation which is $30 and requires pre planning. Lots of koi to feed. Took about 1/2 hour to slowly stroll. Admission $5",
          "This is a worst, saddest garden I ever seen. It took us 5 minutes to walk around and we see nothing, except green water in a pond, half dead pines and couple of Japanese little statues. Do not waste your time.",
          "Don't waste your time while they are still working. The beauty of the place is ruined. We paid $1 less, but it wasn't worth it . Should be free right now. I'm sure it will be nice when complete.",
          "I decided to make a visit to this Japanese Garden to get an idea of what it had to offer. I was so happy I made the trek to the little neighborhood where it is hidden! It is definitely small and somewhat unassuming, but it was quiet, had a wonderful little walking path through",
          "When we went to the garden the pools were almost drained with ugly pipes, tubes, and generators everywhere. What was left was an ugly green slime which completely detracted from any other part of the garden. I feel like we wasted our money. Go to Portland Oregon and check out",
          "I took a day off work so my six year old granddaughter and I could go here during her Fall break from school. We purchased Koi food at the front desk because that's the main reason we went...she wanted to feed the fish. I understand they need to make money for the renovations",
          "I stopped by the Japanese Friendship Garden today and I was very disappointed. Upon entering, I noticed the admission was only $4 instead of the $5 as listed online, and there was signage stating the koi point was being worked on to improve it. Being worked on is an",
          "I was amazed to find this beautiful island of calm right in the middle of the city. Beautiful plantings, a nice pond with koi, some interesting sculpture, but most of all, a great place to find a little peace.",
          "We came to visit on a Friday afternoon. The first thing we liked was that we found plenty of free parking right by the garden. That was a big plus, since it's right in the middle of the downtown area. There is a koi pond so, of course, you can purchase the food pellets to throw",
          "My fianc\u00e9 and I visited this place a few weeks ago based on the recommendation of our neighbor who had attended a traditional Japanese tea ceremony there with her boyfriend. We had business to attend to downtown, which was early in the day, so we weren't able to experience the",

          "Fun place tucked into a neighborhood. Went for a music event. They had music strewn around the garden while the garden was lit up at night. You'd never expect this place to be where it is. Just a great little spot for an event or stroll.",
          "It was very traditional in nature and educational. I think that if you have a love for japanese culture it is worthwhile. The grounds are beautiful and docent very knowledgable.",
          "Visiting this garden reminded me of my time in Japan. It won't take long to walk through but this charming oasis in the heart of a busy city is worth a visit if you're in the area.",
          "This is a hidden gem its beautiful to walk around or just for a while in peace. Its really not a big place and the fish are amazing and practically eat out of your hands. This is a good place for kids or older folks as there not a ton of walking.",
          "My family visited the gardens with my 90 year old Dad. It was perfect for a short and simple little walk. There was lots of benches to just sit and listen to the waterfalls, as well as a fairly short circular path with lots of shade to enjoy. Definitely were astounded by the",
          "I agree with most other contributors, it really is a small nice place, but at $5/person it is seriously overpriced... If you are on a budget ans still want to visit - they have free/ voluntary donation admission on first Friday of each month.",
          "My sister and I were trying to kill time and trying to find a cheap and kid friendly place to take the kids to. This place was $5 per person with $3 for student and 3 and under free. The gift shop where we went to pay for entrance had a very sweet older lady help us. The",
          "Many shady benches under trees left one ok in high temperatures. There were many different plants and ducks to view. Inexpensive admission was great.",

          "Perfect spot to get away from the hustle and bustle of a busy city. We visited with some family from out of town and absolutely loved the peaceful, serene atmosphere and enjoyed the self guided tour provided. It's a short 30 minute stroll that is worth the price and the time to",
          "I found the Japanese Friendship Gardens to be hardly worth the trip from the Sun City area. Yes, the grounds are nice, a bit underwhelming for my expectations. More interesting was the construction of the huge apartment complex bordering the garden. Admission was $5. From",
          "We enjoyed a stroll thru this incredible garden. It is a quiet oasis in the middle of Phoenix and should be enjoyed by everyone who loves horticulture.",
          "If you have 30 minutes to waste and don't mind burni ng a $5 it's worth a look. Do not think you'll be making a day of it by any means, its very small. The koi are obviously well feed and will come right over to see if you have food for them (sold for $1/bag).",
          "Nice place very quite but is very small and takes about 10 mins to see the whole thing. $5 for adults. Beautiful and quite!",
          "This is one of the smaller Japanese gardens that I've been to but the pagodas, waterfall, streams, bridges, and animals were representative of what you would see in any Japanese garden. It was a clean, quiet, lush area. Wish there were fewer pigeons and real swans versus the",
          "Right in the heart of the city! Peaceful and beautiful spot to walk, take pictures and enjoy the quietness. Be sure to buy food to feed the ducks when you buy your tickets Their restrooms were even worth the trip - so clean, so beautiful!",
          "A lovely, tranquil spot in the heart of downtown Phoenix. A mini tour of an authentic Japanese garden.",
          "A surprising diversion in the arid Southwest. Beautifully designed and maintained, it invites leisurly strolls and contemplation.",
          "Super in-expensive to enter. Very quiet, beautiful garden situated in Downtown. Doesn't take very long to walk around the entire place. Good for relaxation and pictures.",
          "My 16 yr old daughter found this online and kept saying she wanted to go when we visited. So we had some time yesterday. It was great weather. We walked around then sat and relaxed for about an hour or so. Was so nice! Cute baby ducks and tons of koi fish to feed and watch.",
          "A nice garden in the middle of Phoenix. It took us about 30 minutes to see the entire garden. Not really worth the admission price. The fish were cool and the garden is nicely kept up.",
          "Took the kids for an early morning walk through the garden for something \"different\" to do. We fed the fish. The kids loved that. It was very peaceful. Lots of couples taking engagement photos.",
          "I rate this a three because I wouldn't say it a \"must see\" local attraction. It's a nice tranquil retreat near downtown which only costs $5. Walked through on a Sunday afternoon and it was enjoyable. Spent about 30 minutes there.",
          "These are so beautiful. Who wants to see a wonderful garden should visit this. If you are a local or traveler to our state this is a must see.",
          "It was a calm and beautiful experience. But you would expect to see some more flowers or something in that area. The Koi fish were cute and it's nice they have koi food for people to feed the fish too and birds (have to pay). It was nice and beautiful though.",
          "I was speaking to a friend about photo ops in Phoenix when she mentioned the Japanese Friendship Garden downtown. I immediately had to check it out so I headed out one sunny afternoon and, sure enough, found it right off 3rd avenue near the I-10 overpass. I lived in downtown",

          "It is easy to miss the Japanese Friendship Garden, but it is worth a stop. A self-guided tour is easy with all the plaques to read. Around the back is a very good Asian store with prices ranging from a dollar to a thousand dollars. The restaurant is quite good as well. Don't",
          "I was looking for a calm afternoon, but that was not the case. A high luxurious apartment building is been build. The noise was not calmed.",
          "Much of the foliage looked like it was in distress. I don't know if it's the unseasonably warm temperatures this month or the permanent shade created by the high rise going up next door. It is quiet and the koi are HUGE but I expected more.",
          "Peaceful is absolutely the word for this lovely setting. I attended the tea ceremony (book early - very limited) and enjoyed it immensely. However, I was thinking more of the British version, which includes food. No food served here, but learned many Japanese customs. Very",
          "This is a small garden, but a nice example of the classic Japanese garden, with bridges, koi ponds, pathways, lanterns, and interesting plantings and sight-lines. Well worth the time if you are in Phoenix, and even worth a detour if you are on your way through.",

          "First you have to remember this is a quiet and peaceful garden, not something grand and amazing, but even then it seemed small and not quite as well maintained as it could be. The nice feature is the pond with hundreds of koi fish which you can feed using the $1.00 little bag",
          "My husband and I attempted to visit here 2 summers ago not realizing they are closed from May to October. We finally made it back the other day only to be wildly disappointed. $5/ person admission for a small space that doesn't have much going on. Having been to other Japanese",

          "My mother spent a lot of money along with her new husband to have what looked like a beautiful wedding. Although it looked nice, the manager and coordinator, Reyna, started catching an attitude and being extremely rude starting the day \u2026",
          "Completely serene. Hidden sanctuary away from all the hustle and bustle of the city--right in the heart of Phoenix! It's literally a wonderful change of pace from the time you enter to the time you leave. Fascinating history to the garden as well. There needs to be more of these..and bigger.",
          "The grounds are very well kept, beautiful, and serene. The admission price is just way too high for how tiny this place is. Literally takes 5 minutes to walk around the entire garden. Price should be half what they are charging. At least I can say I've been.",
          "Beautiful place to visit. I love Japanese anything and enjoyed walking with my wife there. They had people helping out that were very nice.",

          "The garden is serene and peaceful. It's beautiful too. The only reason for 3 stars is I had only spent 15 minutes and had to use $10 for entry. Probably would be a good spot to think about stuff with peaceful water fall sounds though",
          "NO EXCEPTS ITS A MUST THAT YOU VISIT YOU WILK ALWAYS COME BACK THE VIBE IS SO AWESOME",
          "A lot smaller than what I expected and a lot less seating. Still very chill and serene, but it felt super strict. STAY on the PATH people! We found it hard to spend a long time here, there didn't feel like a lot of places to just sit at with other people.",
          "Beautifuily kept. Hours too short. $10 admission. Staff watch over you. Looming condos. No swans. Few ducks. Lots of gorgeous colorful personality filled Koi's. Small park.",
          "Soothing fresh environment with nice shade casting over you will walking makes for a unforgettable experience I do recommend not to step in grass",
          "They have free entrance days. I would recommend paying to get in on a different day for a more peaceful experience. Great for pictures and watching koi fish!",
          "Such a good place to have a picnic. Garden is well kept.",
          "A lovely little slice of peace in the middle of Phoenix. My boyfriend and I spent about an hour here wandering around, including about 15 minutes with one of the docents who was so pleasant and had a wealth of knowledge to share. Will definitely be back - we even tossed around the idea of getting married here eventually!",
          "My friend's wedding was there last night and while the venue is pretty, the staff was not pleasant. I was part of the wedding party and have never felt so disrespected. The area they let us use to get ready was a joke, then after telling us \u2026",
          "I ran into this place by accident. I got lost in phx, so I stopped to check Google maps and it said Japanese friendship garden so I checked it out. \nIt was beautiful, from the pond with the brightly colored koi fish, to the authentic \u2026",
          "This place has changed since we last took the kids here. No more photos, personal or professional - I understand the professional part, but personal? We wanted to snap some photos with our phones of the kids checking out the beautiful koi \u2026",
          "Staff wasn\u2019t the friendliest but the garden was cute! I went with my cousins and we had a good time. It\u2019s different from most downtown spots, beautiful",
          "The Japanese Friendship Garden of Phoenix or ROHOEN is an authentic 3.5 acre stroll garden with a tea house. The garden has more than 50 types of plants, a 12-foot waterfall and a pond with over 300 colorful fishes. The name ROHOEN stands \u2026",

          "I absolutely love the Japanese Friendship Garden. Take time to feed the koi as you stroll through the garden. It's relaxing and a lovely way to spend the day",
          "We went and explored the Japanese Friendship Garden in Phoenix, whose sister city is Himeji, Japan.  I could not have been happier for this experience unless it had my child listening better.  Peaceful, serene, and beautiful.  There really \u2026",
          "Not worth it. Quiet but nothing to really see. I took the family and we were done in five minutes. We walked in through a second time just to make sure we didn't miss something. Save your money folks.",
          "This is a very unique spot in Phoenix. It's not as large as you may expect. It's a peaceful experience and we'll upkept. The admission price is steep for what you get, but it's definitely worth seeing at least once. The koi in the pond are the highlight. The tranquil setting can be interrupted by screaming kids at the nearby park.",
          "A bit small and I wish they charge half the price. Seemed popular though with locals as there was a line when we left. The kois are huge and had enough room to float around.",
          "A cute place, but I thought it would be a little bit larger and that it would have more events. We spent maybe an hour in the garden. You can walk the garden from edge to edge in about 5 minutes, very small.",
          "Serene, refreshing, lovely, affordable. Great for small children with a grown up per child.  Might be difficult for 2 children or more per 1 adult. They will want to get in the water!!  Its a must see. We spent about an hour tops.  They also have great special events.",
          "Went to the wine and Jazz festival.  Not much food,only one bar spot and the band only played about 10 songs. Good atmosphere but wish there was more music. Maybe in summer.",
          "As soon as we walked, I stopped to show my son the ducks.  We were told by the staff to keep moving (we were blocking the path, I guess). Five minutes later my son say on a rock. We were hassled again. Five minutes later, I got stopped out \u2026",
          "This park is beautiful in appearance and tradition. I love the peaceful vibes that flow here.",
          "It was beautiful and tranquil. Being that close to the freeway I would think that all I could hear is cars but when I was in the garden all I could hear is the wind in the trees and the birds singing. It doesn\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m in \u2026",
          "A beautiful garden, and would have received five stars, except that it is quite small and charges $10 for entrance. That is a bit steep for such a small place.You can enjoy the entire gardens and see everything in 1/2 hour.",
          "Very small garden with several areas closed. For 10 dollar fee one should definitely expect more of cultural immersion.",
          "Beautiful place in the middle of a big city. We had a great tour and enjoyed the garden. If you haven\u2019t been, you must visit.",
          "The garden was absolutely beautiful in the light of the full moon with my fiancee beside me. It was a great pleasure and honor to get to stroll through the garden. I appreciated the chance to see Ken Koshio perform again, and getting to \u2026",

          "Always so calm, really good price for being able to experience such a big park. Would definitely suggest visiting during events",
          "We were there for my friends wedding which I was in and I have never experienced such unprofessional and disrespectful staff in my life! The place itself was beautiful but the staff was so rude. They were caught going through everyone\u2019s \u2026",
          "Beautiful Japanese Garden which is owned and operated by the City of Phoenix. They host tea ceremony few times a year. Closed in the summer time.",

          "Pretty tranquil place, with all the flowing water, Coi, ducks and the breeze. It was a perfect day to be there. The admission price a little high. But they have upkeep too. Apparently they have a festival Coming up i December sounds like fun, will definitely come back.",
          "This garden is really beautiful, green, and shady. A great stop for pheonix. It is a little pricey for the size of the garden so plan on staying or taking a few laps around the pond. They do have a tea house but you need reservations. The \u2026",

          "It is beautiful and peaceful.  Great place for reflection and solitude. Minor details - It's not very big so don't go on a busy day.  It also could use a few more benches with backs.",

          "We chose a culture pass from the library and decided to come here. The gardens and restrooms are gorgeous, maintained well, and clean. Not worth $7 a person to get in because it is small. You can go through it in half an hour or less.",
          "Fair price for a beautiful respite from Urban living. The gardens are wonderfully designed to match the sister City in Japan.  The staff is so very knowledgeable and entertaining. A great place for: families, date night, solitude, or a touch of nature in the heart of Phoenix!",

          "A peaceful walk in the park. Unfortunately there isn't much to really look at, but if you want to take a moment to forget about the hustle and bustle of life this is as good of a place as any. Feeding the koi is relaxing and amusing as well.",
          "Great place to center yourself and meditate",

          "It's always so peaceful and serene.",
          "The Japanese Friendship Garden is a well kept neatly maintained space. Though limited in size, they make the best of the amount of real estate they have.  Pond is stocked full of brightly colored koi and with the sound of a lovely waterfall \u2026",
          "I picked up some culture passes, and I'm glad I did. It's very small and not much for the kids to enjoy. It's definitely better for adults who want a stroll than kids who want to run. It's beautiful, and so many koi fish to see and feed.",
          "I had a lot of fun feeding the fish. They were cute :)",
          "Small and cute garden. You can check out free tickets for two people in local libraries. Fish are pretty healthy and biiiiger! Even bigger than those ducks. Tens of parking lot and a small souvenir shop with fair pricing. Nice place to bring your kids or enjoy some time by sitting on the bench.",

          "I was expecting so much more but the only thing here to get excited about was feeding the fish. I was able to use a library pass so I only paid for one of my kids. Soooo glad I didn't pay full price because it's so not worth it.",
          "One of my favorite things to do.  Very peaceful and beautiful.  The staff is always so kind!",

          "Beautiful place to relax and enjoy nature in the city. Get some fish food for an extra dollar and watch them go crazy when you throw a piece in the pond. Nice for families or couples or solo.",
          "The garden is small but well done; expect to spend less than an hour at the garden (unless you're getting super Zen). We were there early in the morning (around 10 am) and it was not crowded at all. Admission is $7 and a bag of fish food is $1.",

          "This place is seriously a hidden gem. It is such a peaceful place, and once you are inside it\u2019s almost as if you are in a park in another state. The grounds are well maintained, there is no trash, it\u2019s quiet and so beautiful. A perfect \u2026",
          "It is a very nice quiet place.  It is a smaller area than I first thought.  Would have been five star if it had a bit more to do for $7",

          "Very beautiful garden setting for a walk. Well maintained. Nice way to spend an afternoon.",

          "It was a lot smaller than I was expecting, but feeding the koi fish was fun. Great for small children. There is no barrier on the bridge to prevent them from them falling in so be careful.",
          "The place was beautiful, but far too overpriced. $7 for adults for a walk that takes less than 5 minutes. Would be worth about $2 for how small the park is. Otherwise it\u2019s a huge rip off.",
          "A quiet and peaceful Oasis in the middle of downtown Phoenix, the volunteers are so sweet and happy to answer questions and share their thoughts on the garden. It's really a great experience.",
          "Our family enjoys visiting here to relax and see the Koi pond. The small gift shop is great too.",

          "Great place for photos! They will try to keep you on the path, but pay no attention to them!",
          "I don\u2019t understand all the good reviews about this place. I was told twice to get back on the trail by the workers here. Basically it wasn\u2019t much better than a small man made lagoon. Big fish , a few Geese , A couple of Swans . And get this \u2026",
          "Beautiful little place to relax and just get away from it all for awhile. I love feeding the koi and if I lived closer by would be here all the time. Your soul will benefit from a visit to the Japanese Friendship Garden!!",
          "very magical and peaceful experience",
          "Small but beautiful and peaceful",
          "Great relaxing place. Air is different here compared to the rest of Phoenix. In Japanese, you would say, \u3053\u3053\u306e\u7a7a\u6c17\u306f\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3044\u3002",

          "Nice little area, but it's small.  You can walk around the garden in about 15 to 30 minutes if you take your time.  If you want to relax and feed some Koi and ducks, this is the place.",
          "A very nice garden, great for a short stroll to relax. Bring a few dollars for food to feed the koi. This is not a large place, but it's very well maintained and worth checking out",
          "A gorgeous space with a very charming gift shop!",
          "Definitely worth the 30 minutes it took me to get here. The ducks come right up to you and eat off your hands \ud83e\udd29",
          "Beautiful grounds in the heart of the city.  Very relaxing and peaceful. They had hot tea in the gift shop.",
          "The place is beautiful and very well  Maintained but for $7 to walk in a circle is  A little much",
          "What a beautiful place! The garden reminds me so much of Japan and the beauty of that country. It was amazing to just spend time here and feed the koi fish! For $1 you can get a bag of fish food and feed them, which is really cool. I definitely recommend coming here to see it with family or especially a date!",

          "Good place..maintained neat and clean.. feeding the koi fish is fun.. not a very big garden though..but paying 7$ for a visit is a bit costly for this place... however thanks to public library...you can grab a free pass there for two.. and pay 1$ for koi food and enjoy your time..",

          "Just so peaceful.",
          "This place is nice, very peacefull....I think they are a little expensive on the admission ticket. I paid 12 for 2 adults to walk around a very small area that can take you 2 minutes.",
          "It was an amazing first time experience that I would love to recreate every time I go back. We were scheduled for the tea ceremony they have once a month. It was after a shirt tour if the garden over viewing the history and overall \u2026",
          "I have been here many times over the years. On my last visit however, it wasn't a pleasant experience. There were several employees or volunteers walking the garden, chatting people up, telling them to get of the grass or to not feed the \u2026",
          "Love this place! It is extremely peaceful and I enjoyed feeding the coy fish. I took my two young daughters and they loved the ducks and fish. The waterfalls are amazing and walking around you forget you are in a desert as the garden is full of flowers and greenery.",

          "Love feeding the fish. Its very relaxing",
          "Tranquil area to sit back and collect your thoughts. Pricey entrance fee for the short amount of time it takes to walk around. The koi fish are plentiful but beware if you plan on feeding them the ducks will tend to get in the way",
          "Very pretty. Enjoyed the tai chi class here. Doesn't take much time to walk around. There are a lot of koi in the pond.",
          "It is small garden under construction. Entrance fee was $7 per person when we visited. It is clean and beautiful, but spread in very small area. You can feed Koi fish for $1. Small lake at the center of garden with ducks and fish in it.",
          "Pleasant atmosphere,.I was there for a concert; great venue",
          "Great, great place. Lots to see. Do take advantage of the free daily tours. If I lived closer by, I'd take the tours a lot. Each guide is different and each time it is different depending on the group. You really get a lot more out of the \u2026",

          "Absolutely beautiful!",
          "This place is a joke. Thank goodness for the Phoenix public library for giving me a free pass to go here. They don\u2019t allow ANY photos unless you pay them for it. You can slowly walk and see the entire garden in 5 minutes. This place is totally bogus. Save your time and money and just look at it through google maps.",

        "wiki": "Phoenix () is the capital and most populous city in Arizona, with 1,680,992 people (as of 2019). It is also the fifth most populous city in the United States along with being the largest state capital by population, and the only state capital with a population of more than one million residents.Phoenix is the anchor of the Phoenix metropolitan area, also known as the Valley of the Sun, which in turn is part of the Salt River Valley. The metropolitan area is the 11th largest by population in the United States, with approximately 4.73 million people as of 2017. Phoenix is the seat of Maricopa County and the largest city in the state at 517.9 square miles (1,341 km2), more than twice the size of Tucson and one of the largest cities in the United States.Phoenix was settled in 1867 as an agricultural community near the confluence of the Salt and Gila Rivers and was incorporated as a city in 1881. It became the capital of Arizona Territory in 1889. It is in the northeastern reaches of the Sonoran Desert and has a hot desert climate. Despite this, its canal system led to a thriving farming community with the original settler's crops remaining important parts of the Phoenix economy for decades, such as alfalfa, cotton, citrus, and hay. Cotton, cattle, citrus, climate, and copper were known locally as the \"Five C's\" anchoring Phoenix's economy. These remained the driving forces of the city until after World War II, when high-tech companies began to move into the valley and air conditioning made Phoenix's hot summers more bearable.The city averaged a four percent annual population growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s. This growth rate slowed during the Great Recession of 2007\u201309, and has rebounded slowly. Phoenix is the cultural center of the state of Arizona.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Hohokam people occupied the Phoenix area for 2,000 years. They created roughly 135 miles (217 kilometers) of irrigation canals, making the desert land arable, and paths of these canals were used for the Arizona Canal, Central Arizona Project Canal, and the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct. They also carried out extensive trade with the nearby Ancient Puebloans, Mogollon, and Sinagua, as well as with the more distant Mesoamerican civilizations. It is believed periods of drought and severe floods between 1300 and 1450 led to the Hohokam civilization's abandonment of the area.After the departure of the Hohokam, groups of Akimel O'odham (commonly known as Pima), Tohono O'odham, and Maricopa tribes began to use the area, as well as segments of the Yavapai and Apache. The O'odham were offshoots of the Sobaipuri tribe, who in turn were thought to be the descendants of the Hohokam.The Akimel O'odham were the major group in the area. They lived in small villages with well-defined irrigation systems that spread over the Gila River Valley, from Florence in the east to the Estrellas in the west. Their crops included corn, beans, and squash for food as well as cotton and tobacco. They banded with the Maricopa for protection against incursions by the Yuma and Apache tribes. The Maricopa are part of the larger Yuma people; however, they migrated east from the lower Colorado and Gila Rivers in the early 1800s, when they began to be enemies with other Yuma tribes, settling among the existing communities of the Akimel O'odham.The Tohono O'odham also lived in the region, but largely to the south and all the way to the Mexican border. The O'odham lived in small settlements as seasonal farmers who took advantage of the rains, rather than the large-scale irrigation of the Akimel. They grew crops such as sweet corn, tapery beans, squash, lentils, sugar cane, and melons, as well as taking advantage of native plants such as saguaro fruits, cholla buds, mesquite tree beans, and mesquite candy (sap from the mesquite tree). They also hunted local game such as deer, rabbit, and javelina for meat.The Mexican\u2013American War ended in 1848, Mexico ceded its northern zone to the United States, and the region's residents became U.S. citizens. The Phoenix area became part of the New Mexico Territory. In 1863, the mining town of Wickenburg was the first to be established in Maricopa County, to the northwest of Phoenix. Maricopa County had not been incorporated; the land was within Yavapai County, which included the major town of Prescott to the north of Wickenburg.\nThe Army created Fort McDowell on the Verde River in 1865 to forestall Indian uprisings. The fort established a camp on the south side of the Salt River by 1866, which was the first settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam. Other nearby settlements later merged to become the city of Tempe.\n\n\n=== Founding and incorporation ===\n\nThe history of the city of Phoenix begins with Jack Swilling, a Confederate veteran of the Civil War. He was traveling through the Salt River Valley in 1867 and saw a potential for farming. He formed a small community that same year about four miles (six km) east of the city. Lord Darrell Duppa was one of the original settlers in Swilling's party, and he suggested the name \"Phoenix\", as it described a city born from the ruins of a former civilization.The Board of Supervisors in Yavapai County officially recognized the new town on May 4, 1868, and the first post office was established the following month with Swilling as the postmaster. On February 12, 1871, the territorial legislature created Maricopa County by dividing Yavapai County; it was the sixth one formed in the Arizona Territory. The first election for county office was held in 1871 when Tom Barnum was elected the first sheriff. He ran unopposed when the other two candidates (John A. Chenowth and Jim Favorite) fought a duel; Chenowth killed Favorite and was forced to withdraw from the race.The town grew during the 1870s, and President Ulysses S. Grant issued a land patent for the site of Phoenix on April 10, 1874. By 1875, the town had a telegraph office, 16 saloons, and four dance halls, but the townsite-commissioner form of government needed an overhaul. An election was held in 1875, and three village trustees and other officials were elected. By 1880, the town's population stood at 2,453.\n\nBy 1881, Phoenix's continued growth made the board of trustees obsolete. The Territorial Legislature passed the Phoenix Charter Bill, incorporating Phoenix and providing a mayor-council government; Governor John C. Fremont signed the bill on February 25, 1881, officially incorporating Phoenix as a city with a population of around 2,500.The railroad's arrival in the valley in the 1880s was the first of several events that made Phoenix a trade center whose products reached eastern and western markets. In response, the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce was organized on November 4, 1888. The city offices moved into the new City Hall at Washington and Central in 1888. The territorial capital was moved from Prescott to Phoenix in 1889, and the territorial offices were also in City Hall. With the arrival of the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railroad in 1895, Phoenix was connected to Prescott, Flagstaff, and other communities in the northern part of the territory. The increased access to commerce expedited the city's economic rise. The Phoenix Union High School was established in 1895 with an enrollment of 90.\n\n\n=== 1900 to World War II ===\n\nOn February 25, 1901, Governor Oakes Murphy dedicated the permanent Capitol building, and the Carnegie Free Library opened seven years later, on February 18, 1908, dedicated by Benjamin Fowler. The National Reclamation Act was signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, which allowed for dams to be built on waterways in the west for reclamation purposes. The first dam constructed under the act, Salt River Dam#1, began in 1903. It supplied both water and electricity, becoming the first multi-purpose dam, and Roosevelt himself attended the official dedication on May 18, 1911. At the time, it was the largest masonry dam in the world, forming a lake in the mountain east of Phoenix. The dam would be renamed after Teddy Roosevelt in 1917, and the lake would follow suit in 1959.On February 14, 1912, Phoenix became a state capital, as Arizona was admitted to the Union as the 48th state under President William Howard Taft. This occurred just six months after Taft had vetoed a joint congressional resolution granting statehood to Arizona, due to his disapproval of the state constitution's position regarding the recall of judges. In 1913, Phoenix's move from a mayor-council system to council-manager made it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government. After statehood, Phoenix's growth started to accelerate, and eight years later, its population had reached 29,053. In 1920, Phoenix would see its first skyscraper, the Heard Building. In 1929, Sky Harbor was officially opened, at the time owned by Scenic Airways. It would later be purchased in 1935 by the city, which operates it today.\n\nOn March 4, 1930, former U.S. President Calvin Coolidge dedicated a dam on the Gila River named in his honor. However, the state had just been through a long drought, and the reservoir which was supposed to be behind the dam was virtually dry. The humorist Will Rogers, who was on hand as a guest speaker joked, \"If that was my lake, I'd mow it.\" Phoenix's population had more than doubled during the 1920s, and now stood at 48,118. It was also during the 1930s that Phoenix and its surrounding area began to be called \"The Valley of the Sun\", which was an advertising slogan invented to boost tourism.During World War II, Phoenix's economy shifted to that of a distribution center, transforming into an \"embryonic industrial city\" with the mass production of military supplies. There were three air force fields in the area: Luke Field, Williams Field, and Falcon Field, as well as two large pilot training camps, Thunderbird Field No. 1 in Glendale and Thunderbird Field No. 2 in Scottsdale.\n\n\n=== Post-World War II explosive growth ===\nA town that had just over 65,000 residents in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, with a population of nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix as the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas also moved into the valley and opened manufacturing operations.By 1950, over 105,000 people resided in the city and thousands more in surrounding communities. The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in air conditioning, which allowed both homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat experienced in Phoenix and the surrounding areas during its long summers. There was more new construction in Phoenix in 1959 alone than from 1914 to 1946.Like many emerging American cities at the time, Phoenix's spectacular growth did not occur evenly. It largely took place on the city's north side, a region that was nearly all Caucasian. In 1962, one local activist testified at a US Commission on Civil Rights hearing that of 31,000 homes that had recently sprung up in this neighborhood, not a single one had been sold to an African-American. Phoenix's African-American and Mexican-American communities remained largely sequestered on the south side of town. The color lines were so rigid that no one north of Van Buren Street would rent to the African-American baseball star Willie Mays, in town for spring training in the 1960s. In 1964, a reporter from The New Republic wrote of segregation in these terms: \"Apartheid is complete. The two cities look at each other across a golf course.\"\n\n\n=== 1960s to present ===\n\nThe continued rapid population growth led more businesses to the valley to take advantage of the labor pool, and manufacturing, particularly in the electronics sector, continued to grow. The convention and tourism industries saw rapid expansion during the 1960s, with tourism becoming the third largest industry by the end of the decade. In 1960 the Phoenix Corporate Center opened; at the time it was the tallest building in Arizona, topping off at 341 feet. The 1960s saw many other buildings constructed as the city expanded rapidly, including the Rosenzweig Center (1964), today called Phoenix City Square, the landmark Phoenix Financial Center (1964), as well as many of Phoenix's residential high-rises. In 1965 the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum opened at the Arizona State Fairgrounds, west of downtown. When Phoenix was awarded an NBA franchise in 1968, which would be called the Phoenix Suns, they played their home games at the Coliseum until 1992, after which they moved to America West Arena. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson approved the Central Arizona Project, assuring future water supplies for Phoenix, Tucson, and the agricultural corridor in between them. The following year, Pope Paul VI created the Diocese of Phoenix on December 2, by splitting the Archdiocese of Tucson, with Edward A. McCarthy as the first Bishop.In the 1970s the downtown area experienced a resurgence, with a level of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. The nine original villages  have expanded to 15 over the years (see Cityscape below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. The Phoenix Symphony Hall opened in 1972; other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the First National Bank Plaza, the Valley Center (the tallest building in the state of Arizona), and the Arizona Bank building.\nOn September 25, 1981, Phoenix resident Sandra Day O'Connor broke the gender barrier on the U.S. Supreme Court, when she was sworn in as the first female justice. In 1985, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, the nation's largest nuclear power plant, began electrical production. Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa both visited the Valley in 1987.There was an influx of refugees due to low-cost housing in the Sunnyslope area in the 1990s, resulting in 43 different languages being spoken in local schools by the year 2000. The new 20-story City Hall opened in 1992.Phoenix has maintained a growth streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed only by Las Vegas. In 2008, Squaw Peak, the city's second tallest mountain, was renamed Piestewa Peak after Army Specialist Lori Ann Piestewa, an Arizonan and the first Native American woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military, as well as being the first American female casualty of the 2003 Iraq War. 2008 also saw Phoenix as one of the cities hardest hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, and by early 2009 the median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in 2007. Crime rates in Phoenix have fallen in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain, Alhambra, and Maryvale have recovered and stabilized. Recently, downtown Phoenix and the central core have experienced renewed interest and growth, resulting in many restaurants, stores, and businesses opening or relocating to central Phoenix.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPhoenix is in the southwestern United States, in the south-central portion of Arizona; about halfway between Tucson to the southeast and Flagstaff to the north. By car, the city is approximately 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of the US-Mexico border at Sonoyta and 180 mi (290 km) north of the border at Nogales. The metropolitan area is known as the \"Valley of the Sun\" due to its location in the Salt River Valley. It lies at a mean elevation of 1,086 feet (331 m), in the northern reaches of the Sonoran Desert.Other than the mountains in and around the city, Phoenix's topography is generally flat, which allows the city's main streets to run on a precise grid with wide, open-spaced roadways. Scattered, low mountain ranges surround the valley: McDowell Mountains to the northeast, the White Tank Mountains to the west, the Superstition Mountains far to the east, and both South Mountain and the Sierra Estrella to the south/southwest. Camelback Mountain, North Mountain, Sunnyslope Mountain, and Piestewa Peak are within the heart of the valley. The city's outskirts have large fields of irrigated cropland and Native American reservation lands. The Salt River runs westward through Phoenix, but the riverbed is often dry or contains little water due to large irrigation diversions. South Mountain separates the community of Ahwatukee from the rest of the city.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 517.9 square miles (1,341 km2). 516.7 square miles (1,338 km2) of it is land, and 1.2 square miles (0.6 km2, or 0.2%) of it is water.\nMaricopa County grew by 811% from 186,000 in 1940 to 1,509,000 by 1980, thanks in part to air conditioning, cheap housing, and an influx of retirees. The once \"modest urban sprawl\" now \"grew by 'epic' proportions\u2014 not only a myriad of residential tract developments on both farmland and desert.\" Retail outlets and office complexes spread out and did not concentrate in the small downtown area. There was low population density and a lack of widespread and significant high-rise development. As a consequence Phoenix became a textbook case of urban sprawl for geographers. Even though it is the fifth most populated city, the large area gives it a low density rate of approximately 2,797 people per square mile. In comparison, Philadelphia, the sixth most populous city, has a density of over 11,000.Like most of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe daylight saving time. In 1973, Governor Jack Williams argued to the U.S. Congress that due to air conditioning units not being used as often in the morning on standard time, energy use would increase in the evening should the state observe daylight saving time. He went on to say energy use would also rise early in the day \"because there would be more lights on in the early morning.\" Additionally, he said daylight saving time would cause children to go to school in the dark.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n==== Neighborhoods ====\n\nSince 1979, the city of Phoenix has been divided into urban villages, many of which are based upon historically significant neighborhoods and communities that have since been annexed into Phoenix. Each village has a planning committee appointed directly by the city council. According to the city-issued village planning handbook, the purpose of the village planning committees is to \"work with the city's planning commission to ensure a balance of housing and employment in each village, concentrate development at identified village cores, and to promote the unique character and identity of the villages.\" There are 15 urban villages: Ahwatukee Foothills, Alhambra, Camelback East, Central City, Deer Valley, Desert View, Encanto, Estrella, Laveen, Maryvale, North Gateway, North Mountain, Paradise Valley, Rio Vista, and South Mountain.\nThe urban village of Paradise Valley is distinct from the nearby Town of Paradise Valley. Although the urban village is part of Phoenix, the town is independent.\nIn addition to the above urban villages, Phoenix has a variety of commonly referred-to regions and districts, such as Downtown, Midtown, Uptown, West Phoenix, North Phoenix, South Phoenix, Biltmore Area, Arcadia, and Sunnyslope.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPhoenix has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen: BWh), typical of the Sonoran Desert and is the largest city of America in this climatic zone. Phoenix has very hot summers and mild winters. The city is within one of the world's sunniest regions, with its sunshine duration comparable to the Sahara region. With 3,872 hours of bright sunshine annually, Phoenix receives the most sunshine of any major city on Earth. Average high temperatures in summer are the hottest of any major city in the United States. On average, there are 107 days annually with a high of at least 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) including most days from late May through early October. Highs top 110 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C) an average of 18 days during the year. On June 26, 1990, the temperature reached an all-time recorded high of 122 \u00b0F (50 \u00b0C).Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, was ranked 7th for most ozone pollution in the United States according to the American Lung Association. Ozone forms in sunlight, so Phoenix is particularly susceptible to ozone formation. Vehicle emissions are cited as precursors to ozone formation. Phoenix also has high levels of particulate pollution, although cities in California lead the nation in this hazard. PM2.5 particlulate matter, which is a component of diesel engine exhaust, and larger PM10 particles, which can come from dust, can both reach concerning levels in Phoenix.Unlike most desert locations which have drastic fluctuations between day and nighttime temperatures, the urban heat island effect limits Phoenix's diurnal temperature variation. As the city has expanded, average summer low temperatures have been steadily rising. Pavement, sidewalks, and buildings store the sun's heat and radiate it at night. The daily normal low remains at or above 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C) for an average of 67 days per summer. On July 15, 2003, Phoenix set its record for the warmest daily low temperature, at 96 \u00b0F (36 \u00b0C).\n\nThe city averages approximately 300 days of sunshine, or over 85% of daylight hours, per year, and receives scant rainfall\u2014the average annual total at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is 8.03 in (204 mm). Precipitation is sparse during most of the year, but the North American Monsoon brings an influx of moisture each summer. Historically, the monsoon officially started when the average dew point was 55 \u00b0F (13 \u00b0C) for three days in a row\u2014typically occurring in early July. In order to increase monsoon awareness and promote safety, however, the National Weather Service decreed that starting in 2008, June 15 would be the official \"first day\" of the monsoon, and it would end on September 30. When active, the monsoon raises humidity levels and can cause heavy localized precipitation, flash floods, hail, destructive winds, and dust storms\u2014which can rise to the level of a haboob in some years.July is the wettest month (1.05 in (27 mm)), while June is the driest (0.02 in (0.51 mm)). On September 8, 2014, the city of Phoenix recorded its single highest rainfall total by the National Weather Service with 3.30 in (84 mm) breaking the 75-year-old record of 2.91 in (74 mm), set on September 4, 1939. The September 2014 storm was created from the remnants of Hurricane Norbert which had moved up from the Gulf of California and flooded the city's major interstates and low-lying roadways, stranding hundreds of motorists. On average, dew points range from 31 \u00b0F (\u22121 \u00b0C) in December to 58 \u00b0F (14 \u00b0C) in August. Occasionally, dew points can rise to 76 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C) or higher during periods of strong monsoon activity \u2013 creating especially muggy conditions in the area.Generally speaking, the annual minimum temperature in Phoenix is in the mid-to-low 30s. It rarely drops to 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) or below, having done so in only seven of the years between 1995\u20142015 on a total of sixteen days. However, peripheral portions of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area frequently see frost in the winter. The earliest freeze on record occurred on November 4, 1956, and the latest occurred on March 31, 1987.  The all-time lowest recorded temperature in Phoenix was 16 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C) on January 7, 1913, while the coldest daily high temperature ever recorded was 36 \u00b0F (2 \u00b0C) on December 10, 1898. The longest continuous stretch without a day of frost in Phoenix was over 5 years, from November 23, 1979, to January 31, 1985.Snow is a rare occurrence in Phoenix. Snowfall was first officially recorded in 1898, and since then, accumulations of 0.1 inches (0.25 cm) or greater have occurred only eight times. The heaviest snowstorm on record took place on January 21\u201322, 1937, when 1 to 4 inches (2.5 to 10.2 cm) fell in parts of the city and did not melt entirely for three days. On December 6, 1998, snow fell across the northwest portions of the city, and Sky Harbor reported a dusting of snow. On December 30, 2010, and February 20, 2013, graupel fell across much of the city, although it was widely believed to be snow. Most recently, on February 21\u201322, 2019, the far northern and northeastern sections of the metro area were blanketed with several inches of snow while Sky Harbor received record rainfall.\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\nWhile some of the native flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert can be found within Phoenix city limits, most are found in the suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas that surround the city. Native mammal species include coyote, javelina, bobcat, mountain lion, desert cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, antelope ground squirrel, mule deer, ringtail, coati, and multiple species of bats, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and western pipistrelle, that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including Costa's hummingbird, Anna's hummingbird, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, mourning dove, white-winged dove, the roadrunner, the cactus wren, and many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such as the turkey vulture and black vulture), and eagles, including the golden and the bald eagle.The greater Phoenix region is home to the only thriving feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This bird is a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree fronds.The area is also home to a plethora of native reptile species including the Western diamondback rattlesnake, Sonoran sidewinder, several other types of rattlesnakes, Sonoran coral snake, dozens of species of non-venomous snakes (including the Sonoran gopher snake and the California kingsnake), the gila monster, desert spiny lizard, several types of whiptail lizards, the chuckwalla, desert horned lizard, western banded gecko, Sonora mud turtle, and the desert tortoise. Native amphibian species include the Couch's spadefoot toad, Chiricahua leopard frog, and the Sonoran desert toad.Phoenix and the surrounding areas are also home to a wide variety of native invertebrates including the Arizona bark scorpion, giant desert hairy scorpion, Arizona blond tarantula, Sonoran Desert centipede, tarantula hawk wasp, camel spider, and tailless whip scorpion. Of great concern is the presence of Africanized bees which can be extremely dangerous\u2014even lethal\u2014when provoked.\nThe Arizona Upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert (of which Phoenix is a part) has \"the most structurally diverse flora in the United States.\" One of the most well-known types of succulents, the giant saguaro cactus, is found throughout the city and its neighboring environs. Other native species are the organpipe, barrel, fishhook, senita, prickly pear and cholla cacti; ocotillo; Palo Verde trees and foothill and blue paloverde; California fan palm; agaves; soaptree yucca, Spanish bayonet, desert spoon, and red yucca; ironwood; mesquite; and the creosote bush.Many non-native plants also thrive in Phoenix including, but not limited to, the date palm, Mexican fan palm, pineapple palm, Afghan pine, Canary Island pine, Mexican fencepost cactus, cardon cactus, acacia, eucalyptus, aloe, bougainvillea, oleander, lantana, bottlebrush, olive, citrus, and red bird of paradise.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPhoenix is the sixth most populous city in the United States according to the 2010 United States Census, with a population of 1,445,632, making it the most populous state capital in the United States. Phoenix's ranking as the sixth most populous city was a drop from the number five position it had held since the U. S. Census Bureau released population estimates on June 28, 2007. Those statistics used data from 2006, which showed Phoenix's population at 1,512,986, which put it just ahead of Philadelphia. In 2016, Phoenix regained the position of 5th most populous city, with the census bureau estimating its population at 1,615,017, edging out Philadelphia with a population of 1,567,872.After leading the U.S. in population growth for over a decade, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, followed by the recession, led to a slowing in the growth of Phoenix. There were approximately 77,000 people added to the population of the Phoenix metropolitan area in 2009, which was down significantly from its peak in 2006 of 162,000. Despite this slowing, Phoenix's population grew by 9.4% since the 2000 census (a total of 124,000 people), while the entire Phoenix metropolitan area grew by 28.9% during the same period. This compares with an overall growth rate nationally during the same time frame of 9.7%. Not since 1940\u201350, when the city had a population of 107,000, had the city gained less than 124,000 in a decade. Phoenix's recent growth rate of 9.4% from the 2010 census is the first time it has recorded a growth rate under 24% in a census decade. However, in 2016, Phoenix once again became the fastest growing city in the United States, adding approximately 88 people per day during the preceding year.The Phoenix Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (officially known as the Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler MSA ), is one of 10 MSAs in Arizona, and was the 11th largest in the United States, with a 2018 U.S. Census population estimate of 4,857,962, up from the 2010 Census population of 4,192,887. Consisting of both Pinal and Maricopa counties, the MSA accounts for 65.5% of Arizona's population. Phoenix only contributed 13% to the total growth rate of the MSA, down significantly from its 33% share during the prior decade. Phoenix is also part of the Arizona Sun Corridor megaregion (MR), which is the 10th most populous of the 11 MRs, and the 8th largest by area. It had the 2nd largest growth by percentage of the MRs (behind only the Gulf Coast MR) between 2000 and 2010.\n\nThe population is almost equally split between men and women, with men making up 50.2% of city's citizens. The population density is 2,797.8 people per square mile, and the city's median age is 32.2 years, with only 10.9 of the population being over 62. 98.5% of Phoenix's population lives in households with an average household size of 2.77 people.\nThere were 514,806 total households, with 64.2% of those households consisting of families: 42.3% married couples, 7% with an unmarried male as head of household, and 14.9% with an unmarried female as head of household. 33.6% of those households have children below the age of 18. Of the 35.8% of non-family households, 27.1% have a householder living alone, almost evenly split between men and women, with women having 13.7% and men occupying 13.5%.\nPhoenix has 590,149 housing units, with an occupancy rate of 87.2%. The largest segment of vacancies is in the rental market, where the vacancy rate is 14.9%, and 51% of all vacancies are in rentals. Vacant houses for sale only make up 17.7% of the vacancies, with the rest being split among vacation properties and other various reasons.The city's median household income was $47,866, and the median family income was $54,804. Males had a median income of $32,820 versus $27,466 for females. The city's per capita income was $24,110. 21.8% of the population and 17.1% of families were below the poverty line. Of the total population, 31.4% of those under the age of 18 and 10.5% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.According to the 2010 Census, the racial breakdown of Phoenix was as follows:\n\nWhite: 65.9% (46.5% non-Hispanic)\nBlack or African American: 6.5% (6.0% non-Hispanic)\nNative American: 2.2%\nAsian: 3.2% (0.8% Indian, 0.5% Filipino, 0.5% Korean, 0.4% Chinese, 0.4% Vietnamese, 0.2% Japanese, 0.2% Thai, 0.1% Burmese)\nNative Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander: 0.2%\nOther race: 18.5%\nTwo or more races: 3.6%\nPhoenix's population has historically been predominantly white. From 1890 to 1970, over 90% of the citizens were white. In recent years, this percentage has dropped, reaching 65% In 2010. However, a large part of this decrease can be attributed to new guidelines put out by the U.S. Census Bureau in 1980, when a question regarding Hispanic origin was added to the census questionnaire. This has led to an increasing tendency for some groups to no longer self-identify as white, and instead categorize themselves as \"other races\".20.6% of the population of the city was foreign born in 2010. Of the 1,342,803 residents over 5 years of age, 63.5% spoke only English, 30.6% spoke Spanish at home, 2.5% spoke another Indo-European language, 2.1% spoke Asian or Islander languages, with the remaining 1.4% speaking other languages. About 15.7% of non-English speakers reported speaking English less than \"very well\". The largest national ancestries reported were Mexican (35.9%), German (15.3%), Irish (10.3%), English (9.4%), Black (6.5%), Italian (4.5%), French (2.7%), Polish (2.5%), American Indian (2.2%), and Scottish (2.0%).Hispanics or Latinos of any race make up 40.8% of the population. Of these the largest groups are at 35.9% Mexican, 0.6% Puerto Rican, 0.5% Guatemalan, 0.3% Salvadoran, 0.3% Cuban.\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 66% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, while 26% claimed no religious affiliation. The same study says other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 7% of the population. In 2010, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives, which conducts religious census each ten years, 39% of those polled in Maricopa county considered themselves a member of a religious group. Of those who expressed a religious affiliation, the area's religious composition was reported as 35% Catholic, 22% to Evangelical Protestant denominations, 16% Latter-Day Saints (LDS), 14% to nondenominational congregations, 7% to Mainline Protestant denominations, and 2% Hindu. The remaining 4% belong to other religions, such as Buddhism and Judaism.\nWhile the number of religious adherents increased by 103,000 during the decade, the growth did not keep pace with the county's overall population increase of almost three-quarters of million individuals during the same period. The largest aggregate increases were in the LDS (a 58% increase) and Evangelical Protestant churches (14% increase), while all other categories saw their numbers drop slightly or remain static. The Catholic Church had an 8% drop, while mainline Protestant groups saw a 28% decline.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe early economy of Phoenix focused on agriculture and natural resources, especially the \"5Cs\" of copper, cattle, climate, cotton, and citrus. With the establishment of the Southern Pacific rail line in 1926, the opening of the Union Station in 1923, and the creation of Sky Harbor airport by the end of the decade, the city became more easily accessible. The Great Depression affected Phoenix, but Phoenix had a diverse economy and by 1934 the recovery was underway. At the conclusion of World War II, the valley's economy surged, as many men who had completed their military training at the bases in and around Phoenix returned with their families. The construction industry, spurred on by the city's growth, further expanded with the development of Sun City. It became the template for suburban development in post-WWII America, and Sun City became the template for retirement communities when it opened in 1960. The city averaged a 4 percent annual growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s.As the national financial crisis of 2007\u201310 began, construction in Phoenix collapsed and housing prices plunged. Arizona jobs declined by 11.8% from peak to trough; in 2007 Phoenix had 1,918,100 employed individuals, by 2010 that number had shrunk by 226,500 to 1,691,600. By the end of 2015, the employment number in Phoenix had risen to 1.97 million, finally regaining its pre-recession levels, with job growth occurring across the board.As of 2017, the Phoenix MSA had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of just under $243 billion. The top five industries were: real estate ($41.96), Finance and insurance ($19.71), manufacturing ($19.91), Retail trade ($18.64), and health care ($19.78). Government (including federal, state and local), if it had been a private industry, would have been ranked second on the list, generating $23.37 billion.In Phoenix, real estate developers face few constraints when planning and developing new projects. Accordingly, the city is prone to overbuilding during times of economic prosperity. This explains the city's higher-than-average vacancy rates.\n\nAs of 2010, the top five employment categories were office and administrative support (17.8%), sales (11.6%), food preparation and serving (9%), transportation and material moving (6.1%), and management (5.8%). The single largest occupation is retail salespersons, which account for 3.7% of the workforce. As of January 2016, 10.5% of the workforce were government employees, a high number because the city is both the county seat and state capital. The civilian labor force was 2,200,900, and the unemployment rate stood at 4.6%.Phoenix is home to four Fortune 500 companies: electronics corporation Avnet, mining company Freeport-McMoRan, retailer PetSmart, and waste hauler Republic Services. Honeywell's Aerospace division is headquartered in Phoenix, and the valley hosts many of their avionics and mechanical facilities. Intel has one of their largest sites in the area, employing about 12,000 employees, the second largest Intel location in the country. The city is also home to the headquarters of U-HAUL International, Best Western, and Apollo Group, parent of the University of Phoenix. US Air/American Airlines is the largest carrier at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport. Mesa Air Group, a regional airline group, is headquartered in Phoenix.The military has a large presence in Phoenix, with Luke Air Force Base in the western suburbs. The city was severely impacted by the effects of the\nsub-prime mortgage crash. However, Phoenix has recovered 83% of the jobs lost\ndue to the recession.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe city has numerous performing arts venues, most of which are in and around downtown Phoenix or Scottsdale. The Phoenix Symphony Hall is home to the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra, the Arizona Opera and Ballet Arizona. The Arizona Opera company also has intimate performances at its new Arizona Opera Center, which opened in March 2013. Another venue is the Orpheum Theatre, which is home to the Phoenix Opera. Ballet Arizona, in addition to the Symphony Hall, also has performances at the Orpheum Theatre as well at the Dorrance Theater. Concerts also regularly make stops in the area. The largest downtown performing art venue is the Herberger Theater Center, which houses three performance spaces and is home to two resident companies, the Arizona Theatre Company and the Centre Dance Ensemble. Three other groups also use the facility: Valley Youth Theatre, iTheatre Collaborative and Actors Theater.Concerts can be attended at Talking Stick Resort Arena and Comerica Theatre in downtown Phoenix, Ak-Chin Pavilion in Maryvale, Gila River Arena in Glendale, and Gammage Auditorium in Tempe (the last public building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright). Several smaller theaters including Trunk Space, the Mesa Arts Center, the Crescent Ballroom, Celebrity Theatre, and Modified Arts support regular independent musical and theater performances. Music can also be seen in some of the venues usually reserved for sports, such as the Wells Fargo Arena and State Farm Stadium.Several television series have been set in Phoenix, including Alice (1976\u201385), the 2000s paranormal drama Medium, the 1960\u201361 syndicated crime drama The Brothers Brannagan, and The New Dick Van Dyke Show from 1971 to 1974.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nDozens of museums exist throughout the valley. They include the Phoenix Art Museum, Arizona Capitol Museum, Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, Arizona Military Museum, Hall of Flame Firefighting Museum, the Pueblo Grande Museum Archaeological Park, Children's Museum of Phoenix, Arizona Science Center, and the Heard Museum. In 2010, the Musical Instrument Museum opened their doors, featuring the biggest musical instrument collection in the world. In 2015 the Children's Museum of Phoenix was recognized as one of the top three children's museums in the United States.Designed by Alden B. Dow, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the Phoenix Art Museum was constructed in a single year, opening in November 1959. The Phoenix Art Museum has the southwest's largest collection of visual art, containing more than 17,000 works of contemporary and modern art from around the world. Interactive exhibits can be found in nearby Peoria's Challenger Space Center, where individuals learn about space, renewable energies, and meet astronauts.The Heard Museum has over 130,000 square feet (12,000 m\u00b2) of gallery, classroom and performance space. Some of the museum's signature exhibits include a full Navajo hogan, the Mareen Allen Nichols Collection of 260 pieces of contemporary jewelry, the Barry Goldwater Collection of 437 historic Hopi kachina dolls, and an exhibit on the 19th-century boarding school experiences of Native Americans. The Heard Museum attracts about 250,000 visitors a year.\n\n\n=== Fine arts ===\nThe downtown Phoenix art scene has developed in the past decade. The Artlink organization and the galleries downtown have launched a First Friday cross-Phoenix gallery opening, as well as hosting Art Detour which has become central to the city's cultural identity. In April 2009, artist Janet Echelman inaugurated her monumental sculpture, Her Secret Is Patience, a civic icon suspended above the new Phoenix Civic Space Park, a two-city-block park in the middle of downtown. This netted sculpture makes the invisible patterns of desert wind visible to the human eye. During the day, the 100-foot (30 m)-tall sculpture hovers high above heads, treetops, and buildings, the sculpture creates what the artist calls \"shadow drawings\", which she says are inspired by Phoenix's cloud shadows. At night, the illumination changes color gradually through the seasons. Author Prof. Patrick Frank writes of the sculpture that \"... most Arizonans look on the work with pride: this unique visual delight will forever mark the city of Phoenix just as the Eiffel Tower marks Paris.\"\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nPhoenix is the home of a unique architectural tradition and community. Frank Lloyd Wright moved to Phoenix in 1937 and built his winter home, Taliesin West, and the main campus for The Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture. Over the years, Phoenix has attracted notable architects who have made it their home and grown successful practices. These architectural studios embrace the desert climate, and are unconventional in their approach to the practice of design. They include the Paolo Soleri (who created Arcosanti), Al Beadle, Will Bruder, Wendell Burnette, and Blank Studio architectural design studios. Another major force in architectural landscape of the city was Ralph Haver whose firm, Haver & Nunn, designed commercial, industrial and residential structures throughout the valley. Of particular note was his trademark, \"Haver Home\", which were affordable contemporary-style tract houses.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourist industry is the longest running of today's top industries in Phoenix. Starting with promotions back in the 1920s, the industry has grown into one of the top 10 in the city. Due to its climate, Phoenix and its neighbors have consistently ranked among the nation's top destinations in the number of Five Diamond/Five Star resorts. With more than 62,000 hotel rooms in over 500 hotels and 40 resorts, greater Phoenix sees over 16 million visitors each year, most of whom are leisure (as opposed to business) travelers. Sky Harbor Airport, which serves the Greater Phoenix area, serves about 40 million passengers a year, ranking it among the 10 busiest airports in the nation.One of the biggest attractions of the Phoenix area is golf, with over 200 golf courses. In addition to the sites of interest in the city, there are many attractions near Phoenix, such as Agua Fria National Monument, Arcosanti, Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, Lost Dutchman State Park, Montezuma's Castle, Montezuma's Well, and Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. Phoenix also serves as a central point to many of the sights around the state of Arizona, such as the Grand Canyon, Lake Havasu (where the London Bridge is located), Meteor Crater, the Painted Desert, the Petrified Forest, Tombstone, Kartchner Caverns, Sedona and Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff.\n\n\n=== Other attractions and annual events ===\nDue to its natural environment and climate, Phoenix has a number of outdoor attractions and recreational activities. The Phoenix Zoo is the largest privately owned, non-profit zoo in the United States. Since opening in 1962, the zoo has developed an international reputation for its efforts on animal conservation, including breeding and reintroducing endangered species back into the wild. Right next to the zoo, the Phoenix Botanical Gardens were opened in 1939, and are acclaimed worldwide for their art and flora exhibits and educational programs, featuring the largest collection of arid plants in the U.S. South Mountain Park, the largest municipal park in the U.S., is also the highest desert mountain preserve in the world.Other popular sites in the city are Japanese Friendship Garden, Historic Heritage Square, Phoenix Mountains Park, Pueblo Grande Museum, Tovrea Castle, Camelback Mountain, Hole in the Rock, Mystery Castle, St. Mary's Basilica, Taliesin West, and the Wrigley Mansion.Many annual events in and near Phoenix celebrate the city's heritage and its diversity. They include the Scottsdale Arabian Horse Show, the world's largest horse show; Matsuri, a celebration of Japanese culture; Pueblo Grande Indian Market, an event highlighting Native American arts and crafts; Grand Menorah Lighting, a December event celebrating Hanukah; ZooLights, a December evening event at the Phoenix Zoo that features millions of lights; the Arizona State Fair, begun in 1884; Scottish Gathering & Highland Games, an event celebrating Scottish heritage; Estrella War, a celebration of medieval life; Tohono O'odham Nation Rodeo & Fair, Oldest Indian rodeo in Arizona; and the Chinese Week & Culture & Cuisine Festival, a celebration of Chinese culture.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLike many other western towns, Phoenix's earliest restaurants were often steakhouses. Today, Phoenix is also renowned for its Mexican food, thanks to its large Hispanic population and its proximity to Mexico. Some of Phoenix's restaurants have a long history. The Stockyards steakhouse dates to 1947, while Monti's La Casa Vieja (Spanish for \"The Old House\") was in operation as a restaurant since the 1890s, but closed its doors November 17, 2014. Macayo's (a Mexican restaurant chain) was established in Phoenix in 1946, and other major Mexican restaurants include Garcia's (1956) and Manuel's (1964). The recent population boom has brought people from all over the nation, and to a lesser extent from other countries, and has since influenced the local cuisine. Phoenix boasts cuisines from all over the world, such as Korean, barbecue, Cajun/Creole, Greek, Hawaiian, Irish, Japanese, sushi, Italian, fusion, Persian, Indian (South Asian), Spanish, Thai, Chinese, southwestern, Tex-Mex, Vietnamese, Brazilian, and French.The first McDonald's franchise was sold by the McDonald brothers to a Phoenix entrepreneur in 1952. Neil Fox paid $1,000 for the rights to open an establishment based on the McDonald brothers' restaurant. The hamburger stand opened in 1953 on the southwest corner of Central Avenue and Indian School Road, on the growing north side of Phoenix, and was the first location to sport the now internationally known golden arches, which were initially twice the height of the building. Three other franchise locations opened that year, two years before Ray Kroc purchased McDonald's and opened his first franchise in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Major league ===\n\nPhoenix is home to several professional sports franchises, and is one of only 13 U.S. metropolitan areas to have representatives of all four major professional sports leagues, although only one of these teams actually carry the city name and two of them play within the city limits.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns were the first major sports team in Phoenix, being granted a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise in 1968. They had originally played at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum before moving to America West Arena (now Talking Stick Resort Arena) in 1992. The year following their move to the new arena, the Suns made it to the NBA finals for the second time in franchise history, losing to Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls, 4 games to 2. The U.S. Airways Center hosted both the 1995 and the 2009 NBA All-Star Games.In 1997, the Phoenix Mercury were one of the original eight teams to launch the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). They also play at Talking Stick Resorts Arena. They have won the WNBA championship three times: first in 2007 when they defeated the Detroit Shock, again in 2009 when they defeated the Indiana Fever, and in 2014 when they swept the Chicago Sky.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball began play as an expansion team in 1998. The team has played all of its home games in the same downtown park, now known as Chase Field. It is the second highest stadium in the U.S. (after Coors Field in Denver), and is known for its swimming pool beyond the outfield fence. In 2001, the Diamondbacks defeated the New York Yankees 4 games to 3 in the World Series, becoming the city's first professional sports franchise to win a national championship while in Arizona. The win was also the fastest an expansion team had ever won the World Series, surpassing the old mark of the Florida Marlins of 5 years, set in 1997.The Arizona Cardinals are the oldest continuously run professional football franchise in the nation. Founded in 1898 in Chicago, they moved to Phoenix from St. Louis in 1988 and play in the Western Division of the National Football League's National Football Conference. Upon their move to Phoenix, the Cardinals played their home games at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University in nearby Tempe. In 2006, they moved to the new State Farm Stadium in suburban Glendale. Since moving to Phoenix, the Cardinals have made one championship appearance, Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, where they lost 27\u201323 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nSun Devil Stadium held Super Bowl XXX in 1996. State Farm Stadium hosted Super Bowl XLII in 2008, and Super Bowl XLIX in 2015. It was also selected to host Super Bowl LVII.The Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League moved to the area in 1996, formerly known as the Winnipeg Jets. They originally played their home games at America West Arena in downtown Phoenix before moving in December 2003 to the Jobing.com Arena (now named the Gila River Arena) in Glendale.In 2018, the now-defunct Alliance of American Football announced the league's Phoenix franchise, the Arizona Hotshots, would begin playing in 2019.\n*Note: The Cardinals won two of their championships while in Chicago, pre-modern era.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nThe Phoenix area hosts two annual college football bowl games: the Fiesta Bowl, played at State Farm Stadium, and the Cheez-It Bowl, held at Sun Devil Stadium (though Chase Field has substituted as host while ASU's football stadium undergoes renovations).Phoenix has an indoor football team, the Arizona Rattlers of the Indoor Football League. Their games are also played at Talking Stick Resort Arena. They played in the Arena Football League from 1992 to 2016 and had won five AFL championships before leaving the league.The Greater Phoenix area is home to the Cactus League, one of two spring training leagues for Major League Baseball. With the move by the Colorado Rockies and the Diamondbacks to their new facility in the Salt River Indian Community, the league is entirely based in the Greater Phoenix area. With the Cincinnati Reds' move to Goodyear, half of MLB's 30 teams are now included in the Cactus League.ISM Raceway (originally Phoenix International Raceway) was built in 1964 with a one-mile (1.6 km) oval, with a one-of-a-kind design, as well as a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) road course. It hosts several NASCAR events per season, and the annual Fall NASCAR weekend, which includes events from four different NASCAR classes, is a huge event. Wild Horse Pass Motorsports Park (formerly Firebird International Raceway) hosts NHRA events in the Phoenix metropolitan area.\nThe city also hosts several major professional golf events, including the LPGA's Founder's Cup and, since 1932, The Phoenix Open of the PGA Tour.\nThe Phoenix Marathon is a new addition to the city's sports scene, and is a qualifier for the Boston Marathon. The Rock 'n' Roll Marathon series has held an event in Phoenix every January since 2004. Phoenix is also home to a soccer club, Phoenix Rising FC.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\n\nPhoenix is home to a large number of parks and recreation areas. The city of Phoenix includes national parks, county (Maricopa County) parks and city parks. Tonto National Forest forms part of the city's northeast boundary, while the county has the largest park system in the country.The city park system established to preserve the desert landscape in areas that would otherwise have succumbed to development includes South Mountain Park, the world's largest municipal park with 16,500 acres (67 km2). The system's 182 parks contain over 41,900 acres (16,956 ha), making it the largest municipal park system in the country. The park system has facilities for hiking, camping, swimming, horseback riding, cycling, and climbing. Some of the system's other notable parks include Camelback Mountain, Encanto Park (another large urban park) and Sunnyslope Mountain, also known as \"S\" Mountain. Papago Park in east Phoenix is home to both the Desert Botanical Garden and the Phoenix Zoo, in addition to several golf courses and the Hole-in-the-Rock geological formation. The Desert Botanical Garden, which opened in 1939, is one of the few public gardens in the country dedicated to desert plants, and displays desert plant life from all over the world.\nThe Phoenix Zoo is the largest privately owned non-profit zoo in the United States and is internationally known for its programs devoted to saving endangered species.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nIn 1913, Phoenix adopted a new form of government, switching from the mayor-council system to the council-manager system, making it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government, where a city manager supervises all city departments and executes the policies adopted by the Council. Today, Phoenix represents the largest municipal government of this type in the country.The city council consists of a mayor and eight city council members. While the mayor is elected in a citywide election, Phoenix City Council members are elected by votes only in the districts they represent, with both the Mayor and the Council members serving four-year terms. The mayor of Phoenix is Kate Gallego. The mayor and city council members each have equal voting power in regards to setting city policy and passing rules and regulations. Sunshine Review gave the city's website a Sunny Award for its transparency efforts.\n\n\n=== State government facilities ===\n\nAs the capital of Arizona, Phoenix houses the state legislature, along with numerous state government agencies, many of which are in the State Capitol district immediately west of downtown. The Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections operates the Adobe Mountain and Black Canyon Schools in Phoenix. Another major state government facility is the Arizona State Hospital, operated by the Arizona Department of Health Services. This is a mental health center and is the only medical facility run by the state government. The headquarters of numerous Arizona state government agencies are in Phoenix, with many in the State Capitol district.\n\n\n=== Federal government facilities ===\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons operates the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Phoenix, which is within the city limits, near its northern boundary.The Sandra Day O'Connor U.S. Courthouse, the U.S. District Court of Arizona, is on Washington Street downtown. It is named in honor of retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was raised in Arizona.The Federal Building is at the intersection of Van Buren Street and First Avenue downtown. It contains various federal field offices and the local division of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. This building formerly housed the U.S. District Court offices and courtrooms, but these were moved in 2001 to the new Sandra Day O'Connor U.S. Courthouse. Before the construction of this building in 1961, federal government offices were housed in the historic U.S. Post Office on Central Avenue, completed in the 1930s.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nBy the 1960s, crime was a major problem in Phoenix, and by the 1970s crime continued to increase in the city at a faster rate than almost anywhere else in the country. It was during this time frame when an incident occurred in Phoenix which would have national implications. On March 16, 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested and charged with rape. The subsequent Supreme Court ruling on June 13, 1966, Miranda v. Arizona, has led to practice in the United States of issuing a Miranda Warning to all suspected criminals.With Phoenix's rapid growth, one of the prime areas of criminal activity was land fraud. The practice became so widespread that newspapers would refer to Phoenix as the Tainted Desert. These land frauds led to one of the more infamous murders in the history of the valley, when Arizona Republic writer Don Bolles was murdered by a car bomb in 1976. It was believed his investigative reporting on organized crime and land fraud in Phoenix made him a target.\nBolles was the only reporter from a major U.S. newspaper to be murdered on U.S. soil due to his coverage of a story. Max Dunlap was convicted of first-degree murder in the case.Street gangs and the drug trade had turned into public safety issues by the 1980s, and the crime rate in Phoenix continued to grow.\nAfter seeing a peak in the early and mid-1990s, the city has seen a general decrease in crime rates. The Maricopa County Jail system is the fourth-largest in the country. The violent crime rate peaked in 1993 at 1146 crimes per 100,000 people, while the property crime rate peaked a few years earlier, in 1989, at 9,966 crimes per 100,000.In the most recent numbers from the FBI (2012), those rates stand at 637 and 4091, respectively. Since their peak in 2003, murders have dropped from 241 to 114 in 2014.In 2001 and 2002, Phoenix ranked first in the nation in vehicle thefts, with over 22,000 and 25,000 cars stolen each year respectively. It has declined every year since then, eventually falling to 7,200 in 2014, a drop of almost 70% during that timeframe. The Phoenix MSA has dropped to 70th in the nation in terms of car thefts in 2012.As the first decade of the new century ended, Arizona had become the gateway to the U.S. for drug trafficking. Another crime issue related to the drug trade are kidnappings. In the late 2000s, Phoenix earned the title \"Kidnapping capital of the USA\". Most of the kidnapped are believed to be victims of human smuggling, or related to illegal drug trade, while the kidnappers are believed to be part of Mexican drug cartels.\n\n\n== Cultural Heritage Resources ==\nArizona has museums, journals, societies, and libraries that serve as sources of important cultural heritage knowledge. They include the Arizona State Archives Historic Photographs Memory Project, which includes over 90,000 images that focus on the unique history of Arizona as a state and territory, the Arizona Historical Society, the Journal of Arizona History, and numerous museum databases.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n33 school districts provide public education in the Phoenix area. This is a legacy of numerous annexations over the years; many of the school districts were in existence prior to their territories becoming part of Phoenix. \nThere are 21 elementary school districts, which have over 215 elementary schools, paired with 4 high school districts with 31 high schools serving Phoenix. Three of the high school districts (Glendale Union, Tempe Union, and Tolleson Union) only partially serve Phoenix. In addition, there are 4 unified districts, which cover grades K-12, which add an additional 58 elementary schools and 4 high schools to Phoenix's educational system. Of those four, only the Paradise Valley district completely serves Phoenix. With over 27,000 students, and spread over 220 square miles, Phoenix Union High School District is one of the largest high school districts in the country, containing 16 schools and nearly 3,000 employees. Phoenix is also served by an expanding number of charter schools, with well over 100 operating in the city.\n\n\n=== Post-secondary education ===\n\nArizona State University is the region's largest institution of higher education. While its main campus is in Tempe, ASU also has campuses in northwest Phoenix (ASU West Campus), downtown Phoenix (ASU Downtown Campus), Mesa (ASU Polytechnic Campus), and Glendale (Thunderbird School of Global Management). ASU is one of the largest public universities in the U.S., with a 2012 enrollment of 72,254.\nAn independent, LCME accredited, four-year medical school of the University of Arizona College of Medicine is near ASU's downtown Phoenix campus. There is also a small satellite Phoenix Biomedical Campus for Northern Arizona University (based in Flagstaff).The Maricopa County Community College District includes ten community colleges and two skills centers throughout Maricopa County, providing adult education and job training. Phoenix College, part of the district, was founded in 1920 and is the oldest community college in Arizona and one of the oldest in the country.\n\nThe city is also home to many other institutions of higher learning. Notable institutions include: Barrow Neurological Institute, the world's largest neurological disease treatment and research institution; Grand Canyon University, a private Christian university initially founded in 1949 as a non-profit school, it now operates as a for-profit institution; the University of Phoenix is the nation's largest for-profit university with over 300,000 students at campuses throughout North America, as well as online; and the Arizona Summit Law School, a private, for-profit law school in downtown Phoenix.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nPhoenix's first newspaper was the weekly Salt River Valley Herald, established in 1878, which would change its name the following year to the Phoenix Herald. The paper would go through several additional name changes in its early years before finally settling on the Phoenix Herald, which still exists today in an online form. Today, the city is served by one major daily newspaper: The Arizona Republic, which along with its online entity, azcentral.com, serves the greater metropolitan area. The Jewish News of Greater Phoenix is an independent weekly newspaper established in 1948. In addition, the city is also served by numerous free neighborhood papers and alternative weeklies such as the Phoenix New Times' the East Valley Tribune, which primarily serves the cities of the East Valley; and Arizona State University's The State Press.The Phoenix metro area is served by many local television stations and is the largest designated market area (DMA) in the Southwest, and the 12th largest in the U.S., with over 1.8 million homes (1.6% of the total U.S.). The major network television affiliates are KNXV 15 (ABC), KPHO 5 (CBS), KPNX 12 (NBC), KSAZ 10 (Fox), KASW 61 (The CW), KUTP 45 (MyNetworkTV), and KAET 8 (PBS, operated by Arizona State University). Other network television affiliates operating in the area include KPAZ 21 (TBN),\nKTVW-DT 33 (Univision), KFPH-DT (UniM\u00e1s), KTAZ 39 (Telemundo), KDPH 48 (Daystar), and KPPX-TV 51 (ION). KTVK 3 (3TV) and KAZT 7 (AZ-TV) are independent television stations operating in the metro area. KSAZ-TV, KUTP, KPAZ-TV, KTVW-DT, KFPH-DT, KTAZ, KDPH-LP, and KPPX-TV are network owned-and-operated stations.\nMany major feature films and television programs have been filmed in the city. From the opening sequences in Psycho, to the night attack by the aliens in 1953's The War of the Worlds, to freeway scenes in Little Miss Sunshine, Phoenix has been the location for numerous major feature films. Other notable pictures filmed at least partially in Phoenix include Raising Arizona, A Home at the End of the World, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Days of Thunder, The Gauntlet, The Grifters, Waiting to Exhale and Bus Stop.The radio airwaves in Phoenix cater to a wide variety of musical and talk radio interests. Stations include classic rock formats of KOOL-FM and KSLX-FM, to pop stations like KYOT and alternative stations like KDKB-FM, to the talk radio of KFYI-AM and KKNT-AM, the pop and top 40 programming of KZZP-FM and KALV-FM, and the country sounds of KMLE-FM. With its large Hispanic population there are numerous Spanish stations, such as KHOT-FM and KOMR-FM.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Air ====\n\nPhoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (IATA: PHX, ICAO: KPHX), one of the ten busiest airports in the United States, serves over 110,000 people on over 1000 flights per day. Centrally located in the metro area near several major freeway interchanges east of downtown Phoenix, the airport serves more than 100 cities with non-stop flights.Air Canada, British Airways, Condor, Volaris, and WestJet are among several international carriers as well as American carrier American Airlines (which maintains a hub at the airport) that provide flights to destinations such as Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, and London. In addition to American, other domestic carriers include Alaska Airlines, Delta, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, Sun Country, and United.The Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (IATA: AZA, ICAO: KIWA) in neighboring Mesa also serves the area's commercial air traffic. It was converted from Williams Air Force Base, which closed in 1993. The airport has recently received substantial commercial service with Allegiant Air opening a hub operation at the airport with non-stop service to over a dozen destinations.Smaller airports that primarily handle private and corporate jets include Phoenix Deer Valley Airport, in the Deer Valley district of north Phoenix, and Scottsdale Airport, just east of the Phoenix/Scottsdale border. There are also other municipal airports including Glendale Municipal Airport, Falcon Field Airport in Mesa, and Phoenix Goodyear Airport.\n\n\n==== Rail and bus ====\n\nAmtrak served Phoenix Union Station until 1996 when the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) threatened to abandon the route between Yuma, Arizona and Phoenix. Amtrak rerouted trains to Maricopa, 30 miles (48 km) south of downtown Phoenix, where passengers can board the Texas Eagle (Los Angeles-San Antonio-Chicago) and Sunset Limited (Los Angeles-New Orleans). Though UP retained the trackage and the station remains, Amtrak did not return.\nAmtrak Thruway buses connect Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport to Flagstaff for connection with the Los Angeles-Chicago Southwest Chief. Phoenix is also served by Greyhound bus service, which stops at 24th Street near the airport.\n\nValley Metro provides public transportation throughout the metropolitan area, with its trains, buses, and a ride-share program. 3.38% of workers commute by public transit. Valley Metro's 20-mile (32 km) light rail project, called Valley Metro Rail, through north-central Phoenix, downtown, and eastward through Tempe and Mesa, opened December 27, 2008. Future rail segments of more than 30 miles (48 km) are planned to open by 2030.\n\n\n==== Roads and freeways ====\n\nPhoenix auto traffic depends on both freeways and surface streets. Freeways fall under the auspices of the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT). Phoenix ranks first in the nation in the quality of its urban freeways, and the state as a whole ranks first in the nation in the quality of bridges. While being the fifth most populous city in the nation, Phoenix's freeways do not suffer from the same type of congestion seen in other large cities. In fact, in a recent study, there is not a single stretch of freeway in Phoenix ranked in the 100 worst freeways for either congestion or unreliability.\nPart of the reason for this is the extensive freeway system in the city, due to most of that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985. Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways but no three-digit interstates.As of 2005, the metropolitan area of Phoenix contains one of the nation's largest and fastest growing freeway systems, consisting of over 1,405 lane miles (2,261 lane km). The freeway system is a mix of Interstate, U.S., and state highways which include Interstate 10, Interstate 17, US 60, Loop 101, Loop 202, SR 51, SR 143, and Loop 303. There are still major additions to routes 101, 202 and 303 underway, as well as several other smaller projects around the valley. State Routes 87, 85, and 74 connect Phoenix with other areas of the Valley and Arizona.The street system in Phoenix (and some of its suburbs) is laid out in a grid system, with most roads oriented either north\u2013south or east\u2013west, and the zero point of the grid being the intersection of Central Avenue and Washington Street. The one notable exception to this is the diagonal Grand Avenue, which runs northwest\u2013southeast. The original plan was for the east\u2013west streets to be named after U.S. Presidents, with the north\u2013south streets named after Native Americans; but the north\u2013south streets were quickly changed to numbers, with numbered Avenues running to the west of Central, and numbered Streets to its east.  Major arterial streets are spaced one mile (1.6 km) apart, divided into smaller blocks approximately every 1\u20448 mile (200 m). For example, Scottsdale Road, being the 7200 block east, lies nine miles (14 km) to the east of Central Avenue (72 / 8).Freeways and state highways in Phoenix:\n\n\n==== Alternate forms of transportation ====\nThe Maricopa Association of Governments has a bicycle advisory committee working to improve conditions for bicycling on city streets and off-road paths. Bicycling Magazine ranked Phoenix the 15th most bicycle friendly city of 50 cities in the United States with a population greater than 100,000.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\n\nBeing in the desert, Phoenix relies on a water supply delivered to the city via a system of canals which divert water from the region's rivers and lakes, with the largest portion of the city's water coming from the Colorado River through the Central Arizona Project's canal. The city's electrical needs are served primarily by Arizona Public Service, although some customers receive their electricity from the Salt River Project (SRP). The main sources of electrical generation are nuclear and coal power plants. Arizona is home to the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, the largest nuclear-generating facility in the United States. SRP is also the largest water provider in Phoenix.\n\n\n=== Health care ===\n\nIn 2011 (the last year for which information is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger population than the country as a whole. While the United States had 13.3% of its population over the age of 65, Phoenix's percentage stood significantly lower, at 8.1%. Phoenix's percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45\u201364 was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%. This results in 73% of Phoenix's population being 44 or younger, as compared to the national percentage of 60.In 2010 (the last year for nationally reported figures), Phoenix was at or below national levels for most reportable diseases, with the exception of both hepatitis A and B, where they were slightly over the national average (0.8 and 1.8 to 0.5 and 1.1%, respectively).\n\nIn most major categories, Phoenix had a lower incidence of death than the rest of the nation. Only deaths due to Alzheimer's (29.7 to 27.2 deaths per 100,000) and pre-natal conditions (5.3 to 3.8 deaths per 100,000) were slightly above the national average. Deaths due to HIV and liver disease were exactly at the national average of 2.5 and 10.8 respectively. However, in several major categories, Phoenix had significantly lower indices of death: deaths by cancer stood at only 57% (106) of the national average of 184.6 deaths per 100,000; deaths due to heart disease, 56.1% of the national rate of 249.8 per 100,000. Cancer and heart disease were the two top causes of death in the country.Low-weight births (7.5%) were below the national average of 8.1%, yet infant mortality (7.2%) was higher than the rest of the U.S. (6.1%). Births to teen mothers were significantly higher than the rest of the country, sitting at 12.2% as compared to 8.4% nationally.The Phoenix metropolitan area is serviced by 56 hospitals and medical centers. The Mayo Clinic, a not-for-profit medical practice and medical research group based in Rochester, Minnesota. Phoenix is one of two other locations with Mayo Clinic campuses (the other being Jacksonville, Florida). It is the first and largest integrated not-for-profit medical group practice in the world; Mayo Clinic has been near or at the top of the U.S. News & World Report List of \"Best Hospitals\" for more than 20 years. St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center is part of Dignity Health (formerly Catholic Healthcare West), one of the largest healthcare systems in the western United States. St. Joseph's is a not-for-profit hospital with special advocacy for the poor and underserved. John C. Lincoln North Mountain Hospital is a general medical and surgical hospital, which performed nearly at the level of nationally ranked U.S. News Best Hospitals in 4 adult specialties. The Phoenix Children's Hospital is nationally ranked in 5 pediatric specialties according to U.S. News & World Report. It is a 425-bed children's teaching hospital. Arizona Heart Institute, opened in 1971, is known internationally as one of the first freestanding outpatient clinics dedicated exclusively to cardiovascular health. Banner Health is a non-profit health system in the United States, based in Phoenix. It operates 23 hospitals as well as specialized facilities. The health system is the 2nd largest employer in Arizona, behind Walmart, employing more than 35,000. Banner Health was created in 1999 through a merger of Lutheran Health Systems, based in North Dakota, and Samaritan Health System, based in Phoenix. Of the top 10 rated hospitals in the city (top 12 in the state), 4 are Banner hospitals. Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center is the world's largest dedicated neurosurgical center and a leader in neurosurgical training, research, and patient care. More operative neurosurgical procedures take place at BNI than at any other institution in the United States.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n\nWith the creation of the Phoenix Sister Cities (PSC) organization in 1972, Phoenix became a member of the international Sister City movement. It would take the organization several years to become official, not filing for Articles of Incorporation until 1975, and not entering into their first Sister City agreement until 1976, with Hermosillo, Mexico. The organization's mission statement states their purpose is to \"create people-to-people relationships between the residents of Phoenix and its sister cities through commercial, educational, cultural and artistic exchange programs and events that create and sustain global, long-term, international partnerships and business opportunities for the citizens of Phoenix.\" Phoenix has ten sister cities, as designated by the Phoenix Sister Cities Commission and Sister Cities International, shown in the table below. Phoenix and Prague have shared a Capital Cities relationship since May 1991, which was expanded to Sister City Status in 2013.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGober, Patricia (2006).

It\u2019s like a McDonald\u2019s playland x 1 million! Lots of offshoots and various routes for all to",
          "Love this place. we visit once or twice a year when visiting relatives in AZ and the kids look forward to it each time -formative memories here. love it",
          "The museum has 3 floors (levels) of things for the grandkids to play with. This is an interactive experience for the kids. The play structure will require you to crawl in some places while climbing. The noodle forest is also a favorite along with the pretend grocery store. Kids",
          "I take the grandkids (ages 3 and 5) here nearly every time we visit in Phoenix and they never seem to tire of it. (We purchased the annual family pass.) There's usually something new in the mix, but they never seem to tire of the permanent features either (like the gigantic",
          "We enjoyed the children's museum but found it better for younger children. My daughter was 8 and she loved the climbing structure near the entrance and the arts & crafts room. The other activities were a bit young for her. Great facility for young children!",
          "It\u2019s been a few years since we visited. (When my girls were younger we practically lived at this museum.) This past weekend I took my nephew (age 5), and daughters - 10, 13, and 14. The big \u201ckids\u201d had just as much fun playing as my nephew. I was so impressed with all the",
          "We took our two grandkids (ages 4 & 6) to the CMP and spent more than two hours here while they explored, made 'friends' and got to explore a lot of great exhibits.",
          "As other reviewers have noted, this is less of a museum and more a giant play space. That said, it's a great place to kill a few hours before heading to the airport as it's only about five minutes away. Best for kids under 10.",
          "We visited in May 2019 with our four year old boy and had a fabulous time. The place was buzzing with people and hyper kids when we arrived so we battled through the entrance area and went to explore some of the stuff upstairs first. There was loads for our boy to explore and",
          "My visit to the Childrens' Music was such fun! There are all kinds of hands on exhibits, and intriguing displays that are learning experiences as well. It was hard for me to leave that child's paradise....even as an adult!",
          "We hosted and visited a corporate event here. The staff was helpful; there were some hiccups with A/V but otherwise ok. The venue is on the second floor and elevators are available for those who can't climb the stairs.",
          "A great place for hands on experience for young kid. I would say the age group would be from 1 to 6. Lots of thing for them to do.",
          "Free parking is a plus. My 9 year old had a blast playing in the museum. I highly recommend you check Groupon before you go as we got a GREAT deal. Lots of things for younger and older kiddos.",
          "First and foremost parents need to be responsible for the behavior of their children. My young granddaughter was pushed over twice with no discipline from adults. There are several basic activities but nothing worth the admission price. Maybe if just one child and adult but too",

          "I enjoyed taking my great grandaughter and her mommy to \"museum\" and I DO understand why people are upset when they get there and find it a playhouse. I agree that perhaps a different name, but now that they have estalished themselves, it would not be a helpful idea to change",

They need to visit Omaha\u2019s children\u2019s museum and see how clean it is and how updated it is. I can\u2019t believe with 7 million",

          "This is by far the best children\u2019s museum I have been to. The kids can get lost in the massive tree house they have in the center of the museum for hours. May I add they have a noodle jungle we played hide and seek and tag in. Awesome place.",

This place is aimed at a way younger age range, there was nothing super engaging for my 10 year old. Was disappointed that all ages cost the same to get in, at the other museums",

          "It's a huge tree house of sorts with way too many people and kids. The noodle forest (hanging noodle sticks from the wall) is also a lot of fun for the kids but seems extremely dangerous with kids running in and out. After that, the \"museum\" goes downhill quickly without much to",

          "We went for Playdate Night. The entertainment was well planned. The food and vendors were better than average. All in all, well worth the price paid for that night",
          "We took our 3 granddaughters to The Children\u2019s Museum in Phoenix today; the oldest is 6 and the youngest just turned 3. The girls had a BLAST! There is a small section with scarves that get sucked in and then release to fall to the ground! The race car tracks for toys cars was a",

          "Visited with my 7 year old son. He was almost too old for this place, but we still had a good time. The massive treelike play structure was probably the best part of the museum. I\u2019ve never seen a ply structure quite like that before. We took a baking class and made cranberry",
          "We took our grandkids (ages 4 and 1.5 years) here for a couple of hours - could have stayed longer! So many interactive activities for them. They were totally engaged and enthralled. Provided some education as well as entertainment. Creative stimulation, too.",
          "This tri-level museum hosts many special areas for children to play in and be part of the place. Children appear to be thrilled by many of the interactive nvironments within this museum.",
          "It was really neat. A few neat features. We went on first Fridays so it was free. Would be good place for summer programs.",
          "This is an awesome children's museum. It's even better than the Please Touch Museum in Philadelphia, PA. The museum was very clean and there are employees everywhere to help keep the areas in order and help with questions. I recommend going right when they open as it gets",
          "Possibly the best children's museum in the US. It is a wonderland of child participatory activities for every kind of child, no matter what the interests. There are cooking and grocery shopping activities, art work areas and teachers, science exhibits and even TV activities.",
          "I will happily pay $15 for my toddler to go absolutely bananas in here any day. Unfortunately we\u2019re not from the area and can\u2019t actually do that. From the moment we walked through the door it was imagination central and my 3 year old thought he had died and gone to heaven. I",
          "We came here for my daughter's 6th birthday. All three of my kids 1.5,4.5, and 6 had a blast. They always had something to do and play with. I enjoyed that my 6yr old could help my 1.5yr old through everything. Staff was great as well!",
          "Wow! A sensory overload in the best way. Want 100% nap guaranteed? Then bring your little ones here for a few hours. They will run, climb and play their little hearts out. I wish the food options were better but really you are here to play, build, and imagine. In fact, there is",
          "This museum is best for under 6 years old, but older kids will enjoy it, too. Just about everything is active participation. There are 3 stories of fun, discovery, try, and pretend. There are paid art activities and member activities.",
          "My daughter absolutely loves this place!!! We have been multiple times and she never gets tired of it. Not only is there 3 floors worth of activities, but there are different \"classes\" at different times of the year. The different art-related activities are her favorite. The",
          "My grandkids won't be here until Spring again but already, the seven year old is making sure the Children's Museum is on our list of things to do. He has been there three visits now and wouldn't miss it. It has interactive rooms, activities, imagination sparking spots and",
          "The museum has lots of great interactive exhibits/play areas. It is fun snd engaging, just the right size for little ones; recommend Noodle area for older kids. The bathtub climber, the trikes and the race cars/tracks are very busy and turn-taking is not regulated by staff, so",
          "My grand daughter loved this place, even her aunt got into the fun. My grand daughter especially enjoyed the grocery store. . Think she went back 3 times. She also ended up with pink eye so I\u2019d advise to bring hand sanitizer and use it often.",
          "Super fun - not crowded, fun exhibits, great activity for small children on vacation! Really spacious 3 story facility close to airport!",
          "We had a blast touring this museum while we were at a volleyball tournament at the PHX Convention Center. It is just across the street and free with your military ID. We had a great time. We really could have spent all day there, but sadly only had a few hours.",
          "Kids are guaranteed to love this museum but it's fun for adults and teens too (as long as you have a child with you). Its a fantastic place to play and you could easily spend a day exploring everything this museum has to offer. My personal favorite area is the jungle gym and the",
          "We were so impressed with CMoP and we will go back! It is shockingly resonable. My 8 year old loved everything, especially tge Noodle Forest and the Mega-Mess (seasonal). The staff were all friendly and for a place that sees so many kids come through everyday, it was very",
          "The grandkids loved it here, interactive and fun stuff to do. Perfect for those 100 plus degree days when you want to be inside.So much to do and keep little hands busy.",
          "Last year we visited the Phoenix and Scottsdale area at least 5 times while my mother was at the Mayo Clinic. I traveled with my then 2.5 year old and every time we went to Phoenix, we made sure to visit the Children\u2019s Museum. It is a three story wonderland of various rooms for",
          "Every first Friday of the month, it is free admission from 5 pm. We happened to be visiting Phoenix during this offer. What great luck! We knew it\u2019d be crowded but we just made the most of it. Our younger son loved it! He made crafts, he liked cooking and the car wash. We stayed",
          "This interactive \"museum\" is a wonderful venue for children, open to all ages but especially attractive to younger children from about age 3 - 10. It is fully accessible for wheelchairs and strollers from the parking lot to the entrance, and throughout the building with the",
          "Took my 2 year old on a 100 degree weekday. Great place to beat the heat! There are some outdoor play tubes but most is indoors, including the giant climbing structure which we both enjoyed. Staff members are supervising and blowing bubbles for kids. The toddler area with trucks",
          "This place is super fun for kids. Whenever my two daughters visit it becomes almost impossible to get the to leave. Many activities/exhibits tailored for various ages, so both my 4 yr old and 9 yr old havefun.",
          "We always try to make at least one visit to this museum when we're in Phoenix. Our kids love it, and we spend hours of fun there.",
          "The grandsons enjoyed too much this Museum due to the variety of amenities. You may have a complete morning or afternoon of excellent entertainment. Top recommendation for families.",
          "We went on the first Friiday of the month when it's FREE! They have different vendors who talk about things like safety in the kitchen and a wonderful magician who talked about dental health, it was a very good experience. The downside was it was very crowded. I might",
          "We took our 5 years old granddaughter to the PCM And it was an awesome experience for her and for us as well. We wanted to escape the heat and took her there. Three floors of fun and interactive activities. She made many friends while playing there. The place provides fun for",
          "I bring my grandchildren here a couple of times a year. It's huge, and sometimes hard to keep track of multiple children going in different directions. When there are large groups of school children there for field trips it can be a bit overwhelming. The kids are not well",
          "If we were local to Phoenix, we would have a membership here for sure. The place is huge - and even though it's a little pricey, it's certainly worth it for the hours and hours of entertainment kids get from this place. We were there for three hours and didn't even get through",
          "This is a great way to spend some fun time indoors while the temps are high. Lots of hands on activities for little hands. They have fun ways of learning new things. They even have a small cafeteria so you can grab lunch. It was a really fun day. We will be going back!!! It\u2019s",
          "My 4 year old could stay here all day. There are things to do for all ages, including the littlest ones. The price of admission is reasonable as well.",
          "We\u2019ve visited the Children\u2019s Museum at least a dozen times since my kids were born. It\u2019s always a fun experience for the kids. They love climbing on the tree house, playing in the market and driving through the bicycle car wash. They especially loved the recent addition of the",
          "We had a really good time for about 2 hours, then the girls got bored. they are 7 and 9 and it seemed like the only thing to keep their interest was the large (3 story) climbing thing. They also had fun running through the tubes and playing with the wind tunnels with the",
          "We spent the entire day here and didn't get bored. A great escape from the heat. We participated in a cooking class also, which was fun!",
          "My son loves coming here and I think it is an awesome place for him to roam and have fun learning...",
          "This is a great place for toddlers and young children. There is not much for older children to do here.",
          "Loved the museum and especially the climbing area in the center. The open space works well for kids and adults alike.",
          "Best Children\u2019s museum we\u2019ve been to. Three stories of fun. The art room and painting the castle is an all time favorite and the market and kitchen area are really fun.",
          "This was a highlight of out trip! Our one year old son had been such a trooper the rest of our trip he was so happy to have a destination all about him! He explored every area and had a blast! Everything appeared very clean and all of the workers we interacted with were kind and",
          "Went on a Tuesday morning/afternoon and man was it packed. Tons of kids everywhere. The baby section was nice, since it was limited to just them. Worth seeing once if you have children. Nice they provide military discounts too. Tons of hands on from cooking to painting, maze",
          "I got $3/off coupons by providing my email address on their website, which was nice. We went on a Thursday morning and it was packed with school-aged children, and many buses in the parking lot, so I assume this place is always busy. The 3rd floor has a special area for kids 2",
          "This museum was okay. Nothing bad nothing great. They had a great \"grocery\" store that the kids loved.",
          "This museum is great- not so much a museum as fun place to play and be creative. One of my children's favorite places to go when we have a day off. They especially love the \"store\" area where they can shop, or play shop keeper, stock shelves and weigh and measure dry goods.",
          "although prices seemed high at first, it was well worth the trip. our almost 2 year old didn't want to leave",
          "Three adults, four children (ages 2, 5, 7 1/2 and 9) and the time just flew by. We were fortunate that all four kiddos had matching red shirts so we could keep an eye on them. So much is hands-on, from the 'noodle forest' to the grocery store and lighted tables with magnets.",
          "We had 10 hours to wait in Phoenix for a flight, so we brought our 3, 5 and 7 year old to the museum. We loved the giant climbing structure, although it was difficult for adults to be in/help kids. We spent over an hour in the art room, painting and creating thing-a-ma-jings.",
          "The whole place is one big play room for the kids. We enjoyed watching the grandchildren running from one place to another. It is not a Museum in the sense of Art works - it is more a place of play and art. Fun on a hot day to play inside.",
          "I could not believe it when they refused me entry because I did not have a child with me! I was more than happy to pay and wanted to compare it to similar places in Australia, but sadly not permitted to come in. Thanks for reminding me I wasn't able to have children!!",
          "The way you judge a childern's museum is by watching your child or grandchild. If he or, in our case, she, is involved, excited and curious, the museum is a hit. Our five-year- old was all those things, beginning with the huge climbing assemblage on the first level. It was nice",
          "Plan to spend hours here. You will not be disappointed. They have a re-entry policy so we went out for lunch and came back in the afternoon! This is good for ages 1 to 10. So many different creative rooms, and unique ideas. Staff are helpful and friendly.",
          "Where to begin? Other reviewers have mentioned so many pluses. I\u2019d like to mention that the staff is so helpful and creative in their own right as jugglers, painters and more. As we explored the exhibits we were impressed with the brilliance of those who create the amazing,",
          "This was a wonderful choice to bring the grandchildren (ages 2 and 9 years) . There was something for each to enjoy together and separately. The staff is friendly and helpful. Everything is child interactive. Exposure to science, daily living, working (playing) together. Books",
          "We took our 3-year-old here based off of Trip Advisor reviews. She loved it and we loved watching her excitement. The large \u201ctree house\u201d was overwhelming for her but there\u2019s plenty more to do. She loved the air experiments, Ian\u2019s Corner, and the tricycle car wash. There were",
          "We love the Indianapolis Children museum,so we wanted to check this out. We really enjoyed the museum. There were plenty of things to keep our grandson busy.",
          "This was our second time and our children all had fun (11,6,2 and 1) I would say my 11 year old was almost too old but he still had fun .",
          "This is a great place for the kids to run around and explore. My kids love that they can paint, climb, and run around. It's a lot of fun even after going multiple times.",
          "We took our 3 yr old grand child and she has a blast. Kept busy playing in each of the theme rooms for a long time ., Her older siblings liked it when they were younger .. It\u2019s a great place for the little people ..",
          "A very clean and fun place for children of every age. Lots to do on three level and a huge jungle gym. My 3 Year old had a blast and it looks like they are expanding to have even more in the comng months.",
          "The place was worth the price of admission, helping our young children blow off some steam on their first trip away from home. We could've spent hours in the main room's climbing structure.",
          "I\u2019m used to paying twice as much for a children\u2019s museum, so I was hardly surprised by the $12 admission here. It can feel a little expensive, however, if you\u2019re with many adults because the \u201cmuseum\u201d is really just three stories of educational toys (albeit cool ones.) There\u2019s",
          "This place is amazing! There is something for every age from baby to adult. We spent hours here and still did not see everything. And the climbing structure- out of this world!!!",
          "I went their with friends kids and I was amazed of all the interactive things for them to play with. I visited the gift shop and so, many interesting learning toys. I think its an awesome place to keep your kids busy, having fun and learning.",
          "We brought our daughter here around opening during a weekday morning and had a blast. Spent a few hours exploring all the rooms and our daughter was pretty upset when we had to leave. At $12 pp it is not terribly priced.",
          "We went here with our 1 and 3 year olds. They both had a blast. Each room had an age specific area for the younger babies which was great, usually empty but still great. I like the fact that they had bins for toys kids chewed on or put in their mouths. The climbing structure",
          "Can't say, they WOULDN'T let us in, said we would have to have kids with us!! Wife checked website beforehand, and no such comment, and everyone knows how EASY it is to get to downtown Phoenix!",
          "It has an amazing climbing structure right in the entrance. It is the perfect place to spend the day with kids.",

          "Brought my 2 children (6 yo and 2 yo) they had a blast. I wish they had another area for dining seats it was rather small. Also their \"camp\" was going on since it was summer, it didn't appear that the camp kids were well watched. They kids were rude (pushing and shoving) to",

          "I truly enjoyed my visit with my toddler. This place is great for babies and toddlers. They have an area for little guys that are crawling and climbing. If you go into the 3 and under area make sure you bring socks. Other areas have activities for toddlers, they have tricycles",

          "We have now been here 4 times and each time we discover something new. Our 2 & 3 year-old grand kids love it. Their attention span is limited so they go from room to room, floor to floor, exploring all the different activities. I can't say that any one area is preferred over",
          "This museum is great for kids up to 10 years old! Science meshed with fun activities packed in a three story building. Kids can learn about channeling air, watch golf balls float in the air, get creative and paint a rocket, learn about the human body, or play \"grocery store\".",

          "We had several hours so enjoy Phoenix before a flight home. The children's museum was a great choice for our eight year old. Not only did she enjoy herself she was able to burn up a lot of energy before sitting on a plane for five hours. The noodle area was the best!!!!",
          "What a fun time we had with our toddler Grandson. Lots of places to run and play on a hot summer day. I didn't see anyone having a bad day! The pretend kitchen was his current favorite! I'm sure we will make this a regular on our Grandparent playtime list.",

          "This place was so great. We got there right when they opened and it was nice and quiet. My daughter is 15 months old so she couldn't do everything, but since we got there before the crowd she could take her time slowly toddling her way around, we even made it up the big play",
          "By far the best spot for younger kids in Phoenix. Field trip days are a little rough if you have toddler aged children; on the flip side it is a great place for field trips. Be sure to explore all levels. And if you need a break find a spot in the reading nook!",

          "I would have to agree with the previous review that this is not so much a museum as it is an experience place. The activities in my opinion are best for those on the younger side. My daughter is 2 1/2. I think under two would be too little except for some special areas meant",
          "Important preface: I'm an old grouch who doesn't particularly like kids - except my own - so going here was never going to be a barrel of fun. I expected much more of a museum-like experience, whereas the Children's Museum is in many ways a playground. There are certainly",

          "Got there early with my family, cost about $11.00 per person. There was enough for them to run around and play. Little on the boring side for adults. Not too crowded that you can't get to your kid when you need to. I would totally use this as a giant indoor play area.",
          "We loved the Phoenix children's museum. It was a fun place to visit, and out of the heat! It was especially nice, because we have a museum membership in our hometown, and this was part of the ASTC program, so we were able to get in for free with our pass. A great place for",

          "We've been to a number of children's museums, but this was by far the best. For one, the size of it allows for a ton of exhibits, but the quality of them are very impressive. Our kids could have stayed here all day had we allowed it!",
          "I can see why the locals love this place - they need good fun for kids that is indoors when the weather is hot. The 3-story climbing tree house is awesome. My nearly 5 year old son loved the vacuum tubes with the neon scarves, continuously inserting them and having fun",

          "Had the opportunity of a 'private tour' with a friend who was one of the founders of this museum. To say that I was completely blown away is a gross understatement! As a former educator (for 32 years) I knew that I would be looking at it with a critical eye but also with the",

          "Plan on at least 3 hours to go though the museum. All kinds of interactive exhibits. Fun, fun! We always take a bag lunch and they have a lunch room up stairs. Be careful with the kids in the noodle forest. Really fun, but they can go though and then you can not see them",

          "I don't understand the other reviews about older kids getting bored. There is so much to do for kids of all ages, including adults. My kiddos, ages 12, 6, 4, and 2, would happily spend all day there. Our oldest likes the walls where you arrange plastic pipes to create a path for",
          "I've been to several Children's Museums across the nation. This one is average and not for anyone over the age of 5. My granddaughter was bored, although the climbing structure in the main hall may be worth the trip.",
          "Likes: so many innovative ideas for toddlers to young kids. Great place! No dislikes!! It's a great place all around",
          "We had a few hours to spare before we can check in to our hotel so I decided to bring my 6-year old daughter here. This place was awesome! She loved each and every room in this place. She had so much fun! Every room was well-thought out and catered especially with kids in mind.",
          "Been here a number of times my kids (6 & 2) love going and spending time all around the museum. They provide a lot of different arts and crafts good stuff for a family to enjoy.",

          "My kids loved this place! So many educational things to keep them occupied. I like that they offer workshop for the kids to make things! Nothing beats a hand-on experience for the kids. I plan to take them again this summer but on a Friday, weekend tends to get very busy and I",
          "From the shaded parking under solar panels, this entire experience was fabulous. Giant climbing structure, scarf tossers (you'll understand when you see them. Kid size grocery store, baby rooms with soft padding and lovely soft toys, art, gardening, just plain fun for any kid",

          "We enjoyed all the learning displays and interactive things they offered. Even for an adult, there was much too see and learn. We had fun. The down side is there are kids running around from field trips. but that's okay",

          "I'm so J E A L O U S that we do not have such an amazing, creative, unique, cultural experience where we live! It was just one cool experience after another! Local artists and businesses hep decorate the museum and the simplicity of it all is just perfect! The offer parties that",

          "The museum is a great place for kids. The 3 story tree house is fantastic! The little grocery store reminded me of my childhood at the Denver Children's Museum. The only thing is it was very loud so maybe opt for a day when there's not so many people there. We went on Friday",
          "We loved this place! There is a huge play place to climb and explore, several vacuum tubes to play with - using scarves, balls, and shamis, an entire floor with imagination town, including a tricycle car wash, mini store, street vendor carts, and kitchen. Our kids loved the art",
          "We took our 6 and 7 year olds there. They loved it! Their favorite thing was the play structure! They could have done that alone for hrs. There are a variety of exhibits to keep kids entertained. They so loved the art room and painting the castle. It would be nice to have",
          "We took our 16 month old here and she loved it! She enjoyed walking around, exploring and interacting with the other kids! There is so much to do and see! Being from out of town, we make it out to Phoenix a few times a year and we plan on returning here each time.",
          "The Children's Museum has so much to offer kids of all ages. You could spend hours there. It would be difficult to say what our kids liked best, but one area they kept wanting to return to was the pretend grocery store where they could shop--putting items in their grocery",

          "Everythings great. But I have to express my absolute amazement at the area designated as a 'wal mart' type area! It was PHENOMENAL! The layout and such was ok, the kid cash registers was cool, the items were fun but the psychology you could see in the kids was one of the most",
          "We were impressed with the level of quality, fun, interactive things to do here- paint a castle, make a craft, race cars, have a grocery shopping experience, etc. There are even areas specifically reserved for younger kids (helpful this week as it was spring break and our 2",

          "in town for my wife's convention and I needed something to do with my kindergarteners. They loved it. I don't think it would be great for kids in upper elementary ages but not sure. About 10 bucks a piece. Nice and clean also.",
          "I really like the Children's Museum of Phoenix. I first found the childrens museum about three years ago and have been going ever since and it is always a great time. My nephew enjoyed the museum so much and never wants to leave. There are lots of great activities and places",
          "Our kids loved this museum, there is so much to keep their interest they went around to the different exhibits 2-3 times. They have some really unique ideas here and the favorite was the \"forest\" made from pool noodles. My kids could have stayed for days! Great for all ages :)",
          "Lots to do for our 3 year old who loved the climbing structure, noodle wall, and grocery shopping area, and eagle /owl fan toy ( next to noodle wall!) Our 6 month old enjoyed the baby room with the mirrors and soft toys. Unfortunately our 3 year old was kicked off he slide in",
          "I love this place! I had the season pass for two years and i got so much use out of it! They have an area just for kids 3 and younger. They have a room to build tents! I think the car wash was my little ones favorite area! They always have little classes going on during the day.",
          "Our toddler was 3 years old and was not interested in the massive 3-storey climbing adventure that is the first sighting upon entrance to the museum. The 2nd floor offers an art workshop, Building Blocks and a 'tricycle wash'. The 3rd floor provided the best activities for our",
          "So much to do and for all ages. You can go there many times and still find new activities for the kids. Plus it's indoors so great for when the weather isn't cooprating. I'd highly recommend.",
          "This is one of the best children's museums we have taken grandkids to. WE took 3 of them yesterday 4, 5 &6 and they had a blast. There is a climbing structure that is 3 stories high and enclosed so the kids cant fall out and they just climb and slide and up and down for seems",

          "The price is reasonable, it is 3 floors of actitivies which in Clyde a great deal of physical activity coupled with visuals and tactile. I don't rave about place much - but this kept both a 2 year old and a 11 year old, active laughing and engaged for 5 hours. From climbing",
          "Spent the day at the Museum, which is a misnomer, implies looking at things. But this was a place with lots for kids to participate in. Was very busy in the morning with school visits. So we left and returned in the afternoon when it was much less hectic. Restaurant had",

          "We went to the children's museum of Phoenix yesterday morning. It was a little crowded but the kids had fun. The staff were all very nice and the exhibits were just perfect for little ones. They even had some \"baby zones\". The 3 story climbing structure was AMAZING! The art",
          "My husband and I took our 3year old here a few days a go while on a business trip. She has a blast! It is really more of a place where children can use their imagination rather than learn about science and social studies. She began her day on the climber where she traveled",
          "Different areas, some reserved for very young to enjoy. Well monitored toddler area. Story times with activities.",
          "We thought its a museum and we took our kid there. Don't get me wrong, its a nice place, friendly staff. There are lot of things your kids will love to do; climbing, making stuff, colouring, cycling etc. But what comes to your mind when you think about museum its not that. Its",
          "Lots of fun for the little ones in your life! Climbing, exploring, creating . . . it's all there. We have taken three of our grandchildren for years, and are anxious to introduce our youngest to its wonders.",

          "We have been taking our 7 yo granddaughter to the Children's museum in Phoenix since she was 2. We could spend all day there; there is such a variety of activities and she never tires of them: noodle forest, store, restaurant, climbing structure, art room, bicycles. I was",
          "My 1 year old daughter loved it here. This is more like a play area than a museum. She loved the area where you can do grocery shopping. The arts & crafts area is nice too.",
          "My family and I visited this museum with my niece who was 2 years old. There were MANY things to see and do here. I felt like a child myself being here, all of the attractions in the museum were both adult and child friendly and there was no shortage of anything to do! Make sure",
          "We had a great time at this Children's museum. My 5 year old loved every minute of our 4 hour visit. This place does seem to focus on physical and pretend type of play areas. There is a 3 story tower in the front where kids can explore different silly areas, and a pool tube",
          "Visited with my granddaughter who had a great time. We especially liked the arts and crafts room where where kids can paint, cut out paper designs, and do other simple crafts.",
          "It felt like a violation from how much money it cost for what we got out of it. It is not a museum. It doesn't teach the kids anything. They play. Yes, they like it. But, it is far from what I imagined. They should not be charging adults the same price as a 2 year old. So wrong.",
          "Kids had lots of fun for a few hours. Best for under 10 years old , though any age is fine. Easy parking. Clean and large.",
          "I had to meet someone here and viewed the museum after the meeting. So glad I decided to stay and check it out. While a definite for children, I highly recommend it for adults as well.",
          "This place has a maze of things for the children. Even adults can keep themselves busy by helping the children. There are areas for crafts, arts and works like using the pipes and making enclosures. This gives the children the idea to use the pipe joints like the T-section and U",
          "The museum is expensive because has only one floor of real activities, it has a very creative games and materials in it recommended the 3rd floor it a nice place to visit while in phoenix",

          "This place is packed with fun for every child no matter their interest. Climbing, slides, pretend play, science, art, music making, riding toys. You name it they probably have it and then some! From a planning perspective the museum do take in to account those children that",
          "Having a four year old means finding great activities for him. But activities that involve learning as well as expending energy. The Children's Museum does this so well. It is great for kids under 8, and their dads or moms. Tactile in every way - things to touch, to feel, to",

          "Our family had a great time at the Phoenix Children's museum. We spent about 3 hours there crawling through their exhibits including a pretend market, noodle forest, tree house, and play areas. The museum also includes an arts and craft room where my 4 year old really enjoyed",
          "The Children's Museum is a spectacular place for kids under 8. Everything (signage, restrooms, exhibits) is sized and geared for kids. Almost everything is experiential. There are no video screens anywhere. My three nephews (ages 6, 3 and 1) loved, loved, loved the 6 hours we",
          "We took our 7-yr old niece here for two visits (within 6-mos of one another) and she had a blast each time. There's so much for her to do here that we spent about 4 hours during each visit. I really enjoy watching her interact with other kids in the grocery store and",
          "My husband, myself and our 2 1/2 year old bought a Groupon for the Phoenix Childrens Museum. We went the Friday after Thanksgiving. It was great. There were so many different exhibits that were fun for our daughter and a few that even the adults enjoyed. We would highly",
          "Three years ago Monroe High was transformed into the new location for the Children's Museum. The amount of things to do on three floors is off the grid. From a HUGE 3 story sculpture kids of all ages can climb and explore, to a variety of stations - Kitchen, Grocery Store, Art",
          "Fun, interactive, hands-on fun for families especially with younger kids (<preteen). Best mid-week when not as busy. Could probably visit this place in a couple hours and fit in lunch nearby and another museum or site. Area libraries offer free passes. There are discounts",
          "Great value if you can get the living social or groupon deal. younger elementary age will find it interesting. Older kids may get bored. They have some good exhibits, the temporrary ones are better. Skip the museum cafe, a few good restuarants within walking distance including",

          "Take an unused school building and turn it over to the under-ten set. The Childrens Museum of Phoenix has something for everyone who is young. The exhibits and activities are appropriately scaled and encourage parental participation -- always a good thing. Plenty of parking",
          "My daughter had a blast and she is the one that actually gave it 4 stars. She's 8 and said her favorite part was pretending to make pizzas. My husband who took her said that at 8 she was just about at the end of it being interesting for her. At 9 or 10 she would have been too",
          "Great layout of the activities and plenty of spots for parents to relax while still keeping a close eye on their little ones. Even many separate areas for babies/toddlers in the same areas as the older kids activities!",

          "As a grandfather of two boys, children's museums are places we like to go. Phoenix has one of the best. It's not just fun for the kids but it will impress any adult as well. I am amazed at the creativity that goes into these museums. The grandkids will love it.",
          "I went there with my 21/2 year old niece. She had a great time and I had a lot of photo opportunities. The entire thing is like a big playground. I could not put my hands around calling it a museum, which is why I gave it a four instead of five. So if you want to bring young",

          "You have to approach this with the proper expectations because you'll be hugely disappointed if you're expecting anything at all like Mesa Verde or other large pueblo sites. The ruins are just some low walls on a mound and the museum itself is nestled between interstate highways",

          "This museum is close to the heart of Phoenix and it reminds us that this same area was home to the Native Americans as well. Take the tour of the canals and imagine what it must have been like to have built them with the tools they had. \u2026",

          "I really loved the experience of walking around Pueblo Grande.  It is a trip back in time in the middle of the city. While the adults enjoyed it a lot, it wasn't something our 5 and 9 year olds were ready to appreciate. However, for history lovers, this is a must!",
          "Lots of interesting facts",
          "Very interesting segment of early American Indian history for the Phoenix area river basin",
          "Interesting and informative. Staff really took the time to answer our questions. I was dIsappointed  to see some trash accumulation in the displays outside. \"Modern\" disrespect to history.. It is worth the  trip.",

A must see for anyone interested in pre Colombian America.",

          "Honestly not that much to see and do as it's a small museum, but it's okay. If are visiting during the warmer months, I HIGHLY recommend that you use the umbrellas that are offered to you. The hike is small but can wear on those who are sensitive to heat. The umbrellas do a great job at blocking some of the heat. ",
          "Very interesting",
          "I was impressed  with the archeological site and how it has been preserved.  I also was amazed that a whole civilization of people's occupied the area thousand of years ago and the way the good job the museum did presenting the story.  \nThe museum and site is right next to the airport and a few miles outside of downtown Phoenix.",

          "Unusual museum since there is more outdoors than in. Be prepared to walk a lot to see the outside ruins. It is interesting but beware of when you go. Hot weather will make it unpleasant for you. They provide umbrellas to shield you from the sun, but since the trails are paved, you get hot from feet up.",

          "It is a nice museum. But the structures not very impressive. More vegetation along the trails would help. Also, a lot more could be done with the Cross Cut Canal; it is not every where in Phoenix where you have flowing water like that.  You \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix, Arizona, United States, was the last home for Arizona's Territorial government, until Arizona became a state in 1912. Initially, all three branches of the new state government occupied the four floors of the statehouse. As the state expanded the branches relocated to adjacent buildings and additions. The 1901 portion of the Capitol is now maintained as the Arizona Capitol Museum with a focus on the history and culture of Arizona. The Arizona State Library which occupied most of the 1938 addition until July 2017 re-opened in late 2018 as a part of the Arizona Capitol Museum.\n\n\n== Arizona Capitol Museum ==\n\nMuseum exhibits, events, and programs focus on the evolution of Arizona from Territory to State. The Arizona Takes Shape exhibit provides school-age visitors curriculum-related information for Arizona State History and government studies.  The museum has over 20 exhibits featuring contemporary, historical and artifacts from the Arizona state-owned collections. Permanent exhibits include the sinking of USS Arizona, the formal silver service from USS Arizona, a timeline of events pivotal in making Arizona a state, the Governor and Secretary of State's original offices, the historical senate, and house. \nVisitors can enter the Historic House Chamber where the people can sit at the desks. There is also a room dedicated to the 140 changes in the Arizona Constitution over 100 years of statehood. The Governor's office on the second includes artifacts from several of Arizona's governors as well as a flag used by Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders.\nOne impressive display shows the enormous silver and copper punchbowl service from USS Arizona, as well as a bronze sculpture that was ensconced outside the Admiral's stateroom and used as a centerpiece at state dinners wherever USS Arizona was docked. Both of these historical artifacts survived the sinking of Arizona because they had been removed from the ship for cleaning prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The punchbowl service is the only one of its kind and is composed of etched copper panels depicting desert scenes set into a silver bowl ornamented with mermaids, dolphins, waves, and other nautical themes.\nOf particular interest is the display of a collection of gifts received by Arizona as part of the \"Merci Train\" sent by France to the United States following World War II. The French wanted to thank America for sending the \"Friendship Train\": 250 railroad cars full of fuel, oil, and food in 1948 during a time that the European countries were devastated by World War II. Tens of thousands of French citizens donated objects to be sent to the United States and it was decided that because the outpouring of goods was so great, one boxcar would be sent to each state with one being shared between the District of Columbia and the Territory of Hawaii. All of the items were to be loaded in \"Forty and Eight\"-type boxcars, named after the sign painted on them which stated that 40 men or 8 horses could be loaded inside. Each car was to be adorned with the coats of arms of all of the provinces of France. The capitol building displays work by the noted Arizona artist Lon Megargee.\nThe museum is launching a rental program for private rental. For the first time in history, this historic building will be the backdrop for receptions, business dinners, and weddings.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was created as part of an effort to demonstrate that the Arizona Territory was ready for statehood. A design contest was won by James Riely Gordon, whose original plan called for the Capitol to be much larger, with a more prominent rotunda and large wings for both houses of the legislature on each side of the current building. Funding deficits meant the project had to be reduced, so the legislative wings were discarded from the plan and a small lead-alloy top substituted for Gordon's decorative dome.Construction of the Capitol began in 1898, and it began operation in 1901. In 1918 and 1938, expansions were added on the west side of the building, which had the same architecture and increased the total square footage from the original 40,000 to a final 123,000. It was home to the Legislature until 1960, when the current house and senate buildings were constructed, and the Governor's Office until 1974, when the executive tower was built. The state at that time had a plan of converting the original Capitol into a museum dedicated to Arizona's history. The original opening of the Arizona Capitol Museum was announced by Governor Bruce Babbitt at his inauguration in 1978 and hosted over 40,000 schoolchildren in that first year in 1979. After a restoration, the building was re-opened as a museum in 1981. In the 1990s, more than $3 million was spent to renovate the Capitol and rooms were restored to their original design. Again, due to budget deficits, construction was stopped on a few rooms on the third floor and they remain incomplete. The Capitol is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nOn January 14, 2010, the Arizona State Department of Administration reported that it had sold the surrounding state buildings to private investors: the tower, the two flanking legislative buildings, and other state structures. The Old Capitol was not part of this transaction.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe building is made largely from materials indigenous to Arizona, including malapai, granite, and the copper dome. The design is optimized for the desert climate of Arizona, with thick masonry walls that insulate the interior, skylights, and round \"bullseye\" clerestory windows to let heat out of the legislative chambers. The building is topped with a weather vane similar to the Winged Victory of Samothrace, visible through a skylight from within the rotunda.\n\n\n== Capitol Mall renovation proposal ==\nAs Arizona's population has grown, the Capitol complex itself has become increasingly crowded.  The Senate and House buildings, opened in 1960, have been deteriorating.  The Senate, in particular, is prone to constant plumbing problems, and occasionally a broken pipe floods the entire building. The Capitol itself is now used exclusively as a museum, and serves over 70,000 visitors each year, including more than 50,000 school children.  In the past complaints had been made that the site was not pleasing aesthetically, and compare the Senate and House buildings as oversized \"bunkers\" which eclipse the beauty of the Capitol. A task force appointed by the state legislature in 2007 reported that the complex is \"barely\" adequate to suit the state's current needs and \"wholly\" inadequate to suit the state's future needs. As a result, proposals were made in 2008 to renovate or rebuild the Capitol site, to a grander site, as well as a site that will serve the needs of the government more adequately. To date, keeping the integrity of the 1901 building in original condition, including the \"cramped\" spaces occupied by some of the Senate and the House staff have been the main focus for the Capitol Museum administrator and staff.  The building's original usage is part of the state history.\nProposals for relocating some office and meeting space back into the Capitol included the House and Senate buildings undergo either a drastic rebuilding and expansion or a complete demolition and construction of new facilities for the House and Senate. A past Arizona State University study planned a comprehensive redesign for the entire Capitol mall and complex.\n\n\n== Arizona State Capitol Museum gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nUSS Arizona salvaged artifacts\nList of state and territorial capitols in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistoric American Buildings Survey (HABS) No. AZ-112, \"Arizona State Capitol Building, 1700 West Washington Street, Phoenix, Maricopa County, AZ\", 4 photos, 1 photo caption page\nVirtual Tour of the Capitol Museum and Grounds",

          "We went through the museum in a few hours during a rainy day in Phoenix. This is a lesson in Arizona history and it is only paid for with donations. This is spectacular architectural four story dome with a lot of information about heros from the state and how the building was",

          "Our first impression was that this is a relatively old structure for a State Capital, and yet Arizona was granted one of the more recent statehoods (48th) in 1912. My second impression was why did the current governor's office complex get built higher in the rear of the old",

          "We dropped in here and did the self guided walking tour. It only took about 1 hour but gave some good insight into the history of Arizona. Worth a look if you have time but not one to go out of your way to see.",

          "A great place to learn history of early Arizona, but the Crown Jewel is the Silver Service that was taken off the Arizona before it sailed to Pearly Harbor. Money was collected and the Silver Bowls etc are etched with scenes of Arizona from Saguaros to Snow capped Mountains.",

          "Whenever we have guests it's hard to give them a feel of what Arizona is all about, what makes it so unique. A visit to the Capitol Museum lays a good groundwork and helps us decide what else to show them around the valley....will it be cowboy stuff, or visiting mining towns,",
          "I was surprised how great this was. The architecture, artifacts and history were very interesting. Older children who like history will like it.",
          "There is a greeter when you enter. It is self guided tour of the old capitol. It was interesting. This showed the old Governor's office and house of rep. The new building is where the laws are passed today. The outside memorials were also very informative including the Code",
          "I visited this museum in January and I really enjoyed it. There is a lot to see and it's a great history lesson, especially if you're from out of town. Definitely a kid friendly place and very educational. The place is a bit run-down but I did notice there was some restoration",

          "This was a great outing. It's free to visit and there is a wealth of information about the history of Arizona, which will keep and histor/culture buffs happy. We also went out and visited the war memorial walk which was pretty awe-inspiring and worth beholding.",

          "Stopped in for a quick visit and was amazed by the history on display here. The museum is run on donations, so drop a few dollars in the on your way out. Each floor has additional exhibits and artifacts that share the Arizona story. There is a small gift shop on the first floor.",

Home to over 350 permanent hands-on exhibits, the Center provides 400,000 annual visitors with interactive experiences. Aside from the permanent exhibitions, Arizona Science Center has featured a number of nationally traveling exhibitions. Along with daily demonstrations throughout the Center, the Center provides shows in the Dorrance Planetarium and in a five-story, giant screen IMAX Theater. This non-profit corporation provides special educational programs and science activities for visitors of all ages including, summer science camp, Adult\u2019s Night Out, thematic events, Stroller Science preschool programs, and the Science on Wheels outreach program.\n\n\n== History ==\nArizona Science Center, formerly the Arizona Museum of Science & Technology, was conceived in 1980 as a pilot science center by the Junior League of Phoenix. Incorporated as a private, non-profit corporation in 1982, the Science Center opened its doors to the public in 1984 as a small 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) storefront exhibition space located in the parking garage level of the downtown Phoenix Hyatt. The Science Center\u2019s first year of operation saw more than 87,000 visitors.  Some of the original hands-on exhibits are still found in the Center today.\nGrowth in attendance and an increasing demand for informal science education programs led to the Science Center being awarded more than $33 million in voter-approved disbursements by the 1988 City of Phoenix bond to provide the land and construction of the Science Center\u2019s new permanent home. Construction of the 120,000-square-foot (11,000 m2), Antoine Predock-designed facility was completed in 1997. An additional $4.1 million City of Phoenix bond in 1998 added 22,500 square feet (2,090 m2) of much needed classroom and dedicated gallery space for traveling exhibitions.\nThe Center has grown to be one of the most popular cultural attractions in the state of Arizona.  Arizona Science Center has served more than three million patrons since opening its downtown Phoenix facility in 1997. The current facilities include more than 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2) of gallery space; an IMAX Theater seating 289 people; the Dorrance Planetarium, which can seat 210 people; a suite of multimedia classrooms; amenities including a gift shop, food service and lunchroom; and support facilities.\n\n\n== Permanent exhibitions ==\nMany Hands Make a Home: Explores the materials, processes, skills and knowledge necessary to build a home in Arizona\u2019s unique environment.\nAll About Me/The Wonder Center: Both mind and body are the subjects of this gallery devoted to human life. Visitors learn about the physiology of moving, the mechanisms of healing, patterns of learning and remembering and new biotechnologies.\nMy Digital World: An exhibition where one can learn more about the information technology that ties us all together. The exhibit, designed by award-winning experience designer Bob Rogers (designer) and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, includes Harkins Ham Shack, home of W7ASC, a working Amateur Radio Station, staffed by local volunteers. Visitors to this exhibit can use Morse Code to transmit their name.\nGet Charged Up: Experiment with basic forces: gravity, electricity, friction and magnetism. In the Fab Lab visitors can see demonstrations by visiting experts.\nSolarville: An exhibition that provides fascinating visuals and interactive experiences that engage visitors in exploring how we are affected by the sun, alternative ways to obtain energy using the sun and tips for energy conservation.\nForces of Nature: Featuring multiple overhead video screens, surround sound, realistic physical effects and a motion-floor system, the theater showcases one monster storm and extreme geological event after another in a series of immersive montages that puts guests right in the center of the action. The show and the exhibits surrounding the Immersion Theater, which were designed by award-winning experience designer Bob Rogers and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, includes a highly interactive, three-part exhibit zone where guests are able to experiment with science focused on land, water and air.\n\n\n== Programs ==\nDaily Demonstrations: The Science Center\u2019s education staff present free 15-20 minute demonstrations in the theater and stage areas throughout the day.\nFamily Programs: Arizona Science Center offers guests of all ages special themed activities, events, and programs throughout the year that offer visitors additional hands-on experiences on popular science topics.\nLecture Presentations: Learn about current science topics and their implications from local and national experts.\nAdults Night Out: A monthly lecture series.

          "Wow, this museum seems like it was created by adults who don\u2019t know how to engage kids. Most of the exhibits, especially on the ground floor, are corporate sponsorship-driven and don\u2019t have truly interactive elements. The only interaction was pressing buttons that would start",

          "My family and I came here while visiting in the in-laws to give the kids something fun to do inside and out of the heat, and possibly even learn a little something. While there was some very interesting exhibits on display, and most exhibits were hands-on and kid-friendly, there",
          "We visited the museum to see the Pompeii exhibit. The experience was amazing. It was well thought out and I learned a lot. There were many school children there for tours of the museum. I would definitely check with the museum to see what days are the least busy for a more",

          "I took my 5 & 7 year old daughters to the museum. Luckily, we have a groupon membership because the cost to get in plus the mirror exhibit was expensive. It only kept my daughters attention for an hour and a half before they were requesting to go home.",
          "Great museum for kids. Although adults can learn a great deal, the museum is definitely geared towards children and there is even a section for toddlers to play.",
          "Compared to similar kid-focused science museums, this one was probably just as good for the kids, but less interesting for adults. There were some notable exceptions such as the dancing iron filings. Unfortunately, the extra money for the mirror maze was not worth it because",
          "Definitely look into the ASTC Travel Passport program if you're not already familiar. It's a great way to visit Science-related museums when traveling, as we have done in many different areas. Having been to a variety of other museums with the program throughout California",

          "The museum is good. We had 2 kids 7 and 8 year old and they had a lot of fun. Although I personally thought that there are many activities which are not included in the main price. Also, the parking tickets are not validated completely, they are only discounted. Since we went",

          "Appears to be brand new. There are a lot of interactive exhibits that my son and I played with and learned a few things. We did not have the time to see any of the movies although they looked really good. It is a great place to go and be out of the heat on a hot summer day.",
          "We went here for something cool to do. It is pretty expensive to get in and they charge for every movie and special exhibit. We went to the shark exhibit. It was good. Not great. My youngest ( 8 yo) enjoyed the different things. My oldest was so so with center. Probably wouldn't",
          "My family went for a company picnic. The staff treated us great. They catered the lunch with pizza and salad. The food was as pretty good. The science center had lots of exhibits and things to do. The bed of nails and high wire bike ride were cool. Every exhibit worked. There",

          "Had a great time at the AZ Science Center. It was nice to see the hordes of children enjoying the place. The Planet Shark exhibit was fantastic, as was the planetarium, the Flight of the Butterflies documentary, and all the other exhibits I got to see. Wish I'd had more time,",
          "A great spot for kids or adults. There is always a 'special area' for an additional fee, it is not always worth it so before you buy the extra access take a peek inside to ensure you are interested. Plenty to see and do. Great for field trips!",
          "I took my family from out-of-town here a couple of months ago, and we all had an amazing time! It is designed for the learning of children, but those of all ages can enjoy the attractions. I love that they are able to make science fun, and I can't wait to bring my future",

          "This is our second trip to the center and absolutely as good as the first. We saw a different feature exhibit this time and then visited at each of the standards as well. The kids were just as engrossed if not more than our first visit. The facility is clean and easy to",

          "This center is great for kids. As an adult going without kids, it wasn't great and didn't make sense for me. I was also disappointed by the planetarium show \"Space Next.\" Very dry show for such a cool space. Would not go back as an adult, but kids should go for sure.",
          "Stimulate the mind while having fun! The center offers a plethora of hands-on activities for the entire family to enjoy. The new Bugs exhibit is geared toward children and teens but as an adult, I must admit that I enjoyed it too! The planetarium shows are entertaining and",

          "My family of 4 (parents and 2 teeneagers) was confused about all the reviews that claimed this science center to be \"good for all ages.\" We felt like if you were over age 8, this was not the place for you. Each exhibit was obviously geared to the grade school and even lower set.",

          "We've been here 3 times before, once a year for the last three years. There's lot's to do, but some of the displays haven't changed over time, so the kids are having a harder time keeping interested as they age. They really enjoy the weather show that has high winds, simulated",
          "We took our 10 y/o and my parents for a visit. We were mostly looking for an indoor activity to stay out of the heat. As far as that goes, this place is great!! There are several different exhibits (building, body, technology, environment/weather, etc.); the quality of some",
          "Took my 3 daughters and a friend here for her birthday. They had a lot of fun especially in the body area. My husband and I even enjoyed a lot of the interactive exibits. Took us about 3 hours to play/see everything included in general admission. The giant bug exibit was cool",
          "It always seems to be a challenge to find a good family activity that offers more than a few laughs and creates incentives to learn more. A visit to the Science Center does all of this and more. Cost of entry is minimal and truly an entire day can be filled with the activities",
          "Loved this museum for kids. Took grandsons 4 yrs and 7 yrs. they just ran from one activity to another. Took 10 and 11 yr olds..they were a little old for it but enjoyed themselves anyway.",
          "And even a pressed penny machine in the giftshop. It is quite expensive but all there seemed to enjoy it as far as I could see. A great place for the kids and the young at heart.",
          "While certainly providing some interesting and fun hands-on exhibits for kids, not much to offer the adults. Also, there are better science museums in other cities. Good to visit this one if you are passing through Phoenix on vacation. But be forewarned, if you order tickets",
          "great, interactive activities for all ages. interesting information for adults, as well, but try not to go on Wed when it seems all school or camp trips appear to occur",
          "Interesting things here for people of all ages. Special events routinely held. Able to easily spend most of the day and become bored. Access is great with convenient parking. I recommend a membership highly. You will use it frequently. Recently saw the bug display with",
          "A lot of hands on things for all ages; we were a family of 7 years old to 60. Our grandson found many things to occupy his inquisitive and creative mind. A good place to spend the day. I just wish all the extra things to see didn't also cost extra on top of the admission fee. It",
          "This facility is very thoughtful in its approach with sufficient interest for all ages including adults. The displays are well organized with learning factors as well as fun for kids. I am a little disappointed in the bugs display as the size of the bugs are a little off",
          "Had a very nice time with my 2 boys but the museum was a little out dated on some of it's exhibits and the place just seems a little disjointed in its layout.",
          "There are things here for everyone, from 3 year olds to the elderly (that includes me) Plan on spending all day there for a great time!",
          "We went here because we didn't really know where to go during the day and it looked interesting online. It turned out to be well worth it. I love science and science loves me so i totally nerded out at all the cool science things you can do here. from simple physics with water",
          "My husband and I were staying in Phoenix for the night, so we needed to find something to do. This is a fun place that only takes about 3 hours to do. Best part....if you ae a teacher, bring in your teavher id, and you get free admission!",
          "We stopped by for a little fun. The prices are pretty average for this type of attraction and the stuff to learn for kids is great. The water area was a blast for my kids. I really enjoy the nature room and the active storm area. What a wonderful way to learn how things feel",
          "Love the hands on experience for kids, It was fun, and educational at the same time. Only thing was the extra charges for other exibits, unless you are a member.",
          "So many interactive things for kids, plan the day and take your time to all of the areas. Well worth a visit.",
          "Updating my previous review...my oldest is now 11 and we still have fun checking out the exhibits. Kids her age can start really understanding the science behind the exhibits as well as playing with everything. If you (or your child) is inclined to take a moment and read",
          "On the plus side: most of the exhibitions are extremely well done: I found the \"brain\" exhibits fascinating, as well as the physics one. The planetarium is beautiful, and the Arizona Night Sky presentation we attended with live narration was very well done. On the negative",
          "Wonderful place to visit., Information about the body, business, local area, etc was really good. Staff was around, but not really needed as you can just walk around and experience.",
          "There are a lot of interactive exhibits for everyone of all ages. There is a lot to do for little kids especially. It's smaller than some other science museums we have been to, but exhibits make up for that. Note: if you go in summer during the day, expect a ton of kids",
          "Always fun and something for all ages. The kids love it something for all ages. They sometimes have different themes.",
          "Great place! Very quiet when I went. Went as an adult all by myself killing time before a flight. Such fun! Wish I could go back my with my kid!",
          "I brought my 5 yr old daughter to this museum this past weekend. It was really fun! Lots of hands-on things for people to try, helping you learn about the human body, about weather, and other topics such as erosion, electricity, music, etc. We really enjoyed our time there. We",
          "This place has grown up since my last visit. They have enough exhibits to keep kids busy all day long. Children do need to be closely supervised as it can get very busy. For family fun I would recommend one adult per child as siblings rarely share the same interests unless they",
          "This \"science center\" is for younger children. Something I would have liked to know before i came here. Very small building. 3 levels with hardly anything on each level. Stairways going up are very empty. Not worth the time. $18 for a boring walk through.",
          "I've been to the Pittsburgh Carnegie Science Center many times with my daughter, and while some of the displays in the Arizona SC were neat, the place seemed a bit more geared to younger children than my 11 year old.",
          "Plenty of things for the kids (9 & 7) to do for maybe 2 hrs. Lots hands-on but also a little too much that required reading for them to really learn. Not quite the patience for that, but they still had fun. We didn't love it and I doubt we'll visit again, but at 122 outside,",
          "Took my 5 year old daughter here to beat the heat of a June day. Ended up spending 3 hours. Started on top floor and worked our way down (3 floors). Most of the exhibits are hands on and great for children. Can't wait to take her back. We loved the insect exhibit.",
          "Ridiculous parking......had to walk outside in 110 degrees for several blocks to get from parking garage and the elevator was out of order. Once we got inside the building there was no signage to direct us to the check-in/welcome desk/information. Then there was a very long",
          "We are from California so we purchased the summer family Groupon because we visit often. Omg! Had such of an awesome time! Absolutely LOVED the Forces Of Nature!! We took one of my best friends who lives in Phoenix who has never been. He, too, had a blast. Most of the exhibits",
          "This is a great place for any age! The exhibits are mostly hands-on and are really cool. It's great for kids and can be good for adults as well.",
          "Good thing we considered this place because in Arizona the heat can be unbearable. This science museum is surrounded by the heavy concrete walls that help keep the A/C inside the building. The exhibits kept us interested and safe enough to allow each child a turn to try hands",
          "The exhibits are phenomenal and cover many aspects of science that should interest almost anyone. We were able to get into the museum through the ASTC Travel Passport Program due to our membership at another science museum. Otherwise, I would have looked for a Groupon or other",
          "Great for children, but it was my husband and I- and although the exhibits were cool, it was really meant for a younger age group. The stuff we wanted to do was hard to get an opportunity to do it because there were so many children. The physics section is the best for adults.",
          "I took my kids here along with some family members and everyone had a great time. The facility does a fantastic job catering/providing educational information to a vast range of age groups. Definitely worth the visit!",
          "There are plenty of of exhibits here to see that come included with admission. In all fairness-ASC participates in a reciprocal membership program with my local Science museum to which I have a membership, so I didn't pay admission to get in. My kids loved laying on the bed of",
          "Two adults had a few hours before attending a Diamondbacks game. We wanted to be in air conditioning to avoid the 112 degree Phoenix afternoon. The time we spent in the Science Center was unexpectedly enjoyable. The exhibits were well thought out and participatory. The",
          "This is a nice escape from the summer heat if you live in the Valley of the Sun! After walking from the parking garage to the Center, the children were very hot. The first thing they did was play with the water next to the admission desk. After that, we went to the giant insect",
          "When temperatures soar above 100 degrees, this is the place to be. The Imax educational movie is always exciting, the planetarium is fun and relaxing and the water feature is a blast for kids.",
          "We had the pleasure to view this awesome place for kiddos. What a treat to see water activities on such a hot day in May. We also enjoyed the air conditioned IMAX theater where we watched the 3 D ocean , quite impressive. My 6 yr old was bored during the presentation but I",
          "Went here for the featured exhibit and was blown away with the place. This is an excellent option for kids and adults alike. Look out for the special exhibits as they change frequently.",
          "IMAX and planetarium where both fantastic. There are a ton of great exhibits and everything encourages hands on exploration and learning. We saw a liquid nitrogen demonstration that was fun and engaging. The museum offers a free membership for educators so we will definitely be",
          "We enjoyed the entire Science Center but one cannot possibly enjoy the entire thing in one day! IMAX shows were great.",
          "Great fun for young and old! There are lots of science activities for all to do and be actively involved in. There are several floors of science to visit.",
          "In town for the science fair, our group of teenagers checked out the museum and had a great time with all of the hands-on exhibits. We went on a morning in May and the museum was mobbed with school field trips. This did not deter our group. We also toured the Popnology exhibit",
          "You will learn something here. Your kids will learn something here. Your grandma will learn something here. Lots of fun. Expect to spend about 3-4 hrs for your first visit. Tons of hands on exhibits. Some demonstrations. Note: they dont like toddlers/babies in the planetarium.",
          "Adult only night - admission to the center was free - lecture was free. $10 charge per person to see the Popnology exhibit. Our first time to this part of downtown. Nice area, restaurants are close. Love the adult only night. Cocktails were available for purchase at a",
          "Highly recommended, especially for a family or with children. If you enjoy science or not you will learn something and I dare you not to enjoy yourself!",
          "My son (7) and I did a very quick (2 hour) stop here. It was a fun experience, maybe slightly overpriced ($31 for two of us without any extras), but we enjoyed our short trip there.",
          "We took advantage of a Groupon for a combination special exhibit and museum pass. We had a great time exploring all of the hands on exhibits. Lots of fun facts and many things to do as a family. We could easily picture bringing our grand children to the museum and having a",
          "We have a teen-ager so We were agreably surprised by the quality of the exhibits. We started on the 4th and 3rd floors more adult oriented and We finished by 2nd and 1st floor once kids were out. We enjoyed the many experiments and the IMAX film. All in all a very good small",
          "I have gone for both Body Worlds exhibits (fascinating!) and then toured the rest of the museum. There are many areas for the children to have \"hands on\" fun. There is a planetarium and an IMAX theater. I will suggest going early before the crowds are there. \"First Fridays\"",
          "This museum provides different opportunities to see visiting museum collections. Tours like the Titanic collection occur here. The tickets are reasonably priced and the museum is huge. The people of Phoenix are lucky to have such a Science Center located right in the middle",
          "We're PHX residents, so we have a membership. This museum is great in both scope and quality. Kids under 7 can have a great time with the hands-on stuff (water room right off the main entrance, etc.), and older kids can learn a ton while still having a ton of fun. Don't miss",
          "When traveling with the kids, we seek out destinations that have attractions like science centers. My kids spend hours exploring and never get bored. This one was no exception. They had some great exhibits including a weather simulator which recreated weather you could feel.Even",
          "We visited with our two girls 15 & 13. Once we had paid we realised we'd probably made a huge mistake! The average audience is much younger and most of the exhibits are targeted at the young teen market. After spending $60 I aws worried we would be leaving in 20 minutes, but in",
          "The kids loved the nail bed, the building home and all about me rooms. We've been to many other science centers that are not as high priced as this one. I believe the paid admission should include all exhibits. Overall the kids had a great time exploring.",
          "Geared almost entirely towards children. All exhibits for the most part were extra fees as much at $12 more. Very small. It was a shame, we had high hopes for the Popnology but wasn't worth spending the extra and going through everything else. Got our money back, was happy",
          "We were pleasantly suprised by this museum. We've visited many science museums and were pleased to discover new exhibits we'd never seen before. Give yourself at least 3 hours to see all of it... especially if you like to take your time to discover.",
          "My family and I recently visited the Science Center. We are members of a museum in our hometown and so got in for free because of this. We would have paid to go to this place. It has so many hands on attractions. It makes learning fun. My husband and I enjoyed it as much as the",
          "We took two of our grandchildren a first grader and a fourth grader and they loved it. We spent the extra money for the planetarium show and it was well worth it. We were the only ones in the theater so the kids got special extra time. The person running the show showed the",
          "The museum has a lot of hands on activities but many didn't work in the pop no log plus you pay more for it. The cafe was okay but the cashier was extremely rude when I asked about ingredients for my son due to allergies. This is a museum you would be go every few years.",
          "We visited yesterday with young kids and teens. If you've been to any big city science center this is smaller than most. What was surprising was the admission cost the of $18 for adults did NOT include many exhibits and the planetarium. I can understand IMAX was extra fee as",
          "Had a great time interacting with the exhibits. The staff members were helpful and informative. Nice way to spend an afternoon!",
          "My five year-old daughter and I had a great time at the Science Center. My daughter's favorite area was one that uses water to propel balls through the air--I didn't think we would ever see the rest of the museum! The Arizona Skies show in the planetarium really is an all ages",
          "Free on first Friday! Adults only, liquor served, totally great fun. Purchased tickets for the Popnology exhibit and had a wonderful time exploring!",
          "Great place for kids of all ages. Interesting exhibits and displays. Some exhibits are standard science museum fare (pulleys, plate tectonics, robotic arms, water works). Great open facility with lots of room to move around. Popnology special exhibit interesting, more for older",
          "On spring break from Michigan. Went late in the day. Only regret was we didn't go earlier. We could have easily spent the entire day.",
          "nice place to take the family, especially kids. Lots of great exhibits. not too pricey even better if you have a free pass from one of the libraries or check Groupon for a deal. DO NOT eat at the caf\u00e9! If you are going during a meal time pack your own food. The caf\u00e9 is",
          "We are members at the Science Museum of MN and so were able to get in free with the reciprocity agreement. It was smaller than the one in MN but very hands-on and followed similar theming. The kids really enjoyed the weather exhibit where they experienced wind, heat, and",
          "This is a wonderful place to find fun and educational information and activities for all ages. The little kids (3 and 5) loved the water activities on the 1st floor, the 9-12 ages loved that too but they also enjoyed the human body area, especially the nose! The earth science",
          "If you have kids and you want to see hem have fun, get wet and dirty, then the Arizona science center is for you. If you are looking for some adult focused exhibits go upstairs to the solar exhibits or next door to the maker center which caters to anyone between 10 and 100.",
          "Every year my husband and I \"kidnap\" our older grandsons from school and make a day of celebrating their birthdays. We start at breakfast, do an activity and end with dinner. The first couple of times we did the Phoenix Children's museum-Great! But then they hit a stage where",
          "An eye-catching entrance (giant telescope and microscope apparatus hanging from the ceiling), there are four floors of exploration, with many hands on activities, a detailed look at the human body and a new way to see how music works.",
          "We visited with our teenage granddaughter. She was captured by the brain exercises at first but then was equally attracted to the other major exhibits. We also took in a show at the planetarium, which is a good addition to the experience. This is a must see for families with",
          "Fun and educational. Lots to do for kids of all ages. The moving dinosaurs exhibit was amazing. Great place to beat the summer heat.",
          "This is a great place to go to beat the hot Arizona sun for a day! The kids loved the experiments, and activities. There is often a groupon or living social available to get reduced admissions. We bought the annual pass, and have loved the ability to use it at riciprical",
          "Great place for keeping the kids (and adults) occupied. Many things to do, and everything seems to be in working order (but I admit, without dragging any young ones around, we didn't try everything). Friendly staff who also are well informed. Was there as the school groups",
          "I've been to this museum 4-5 times and every time I see things I didn't see before and learn new things. It's a great place to take my grand kids. Even as teenagers they enjoy it and that is enough of a recommendation. But really it's a treat for the whole family.",
          "You need a day to do this justice! The Popnology exhibit is a blast. It pairs science fact games and activities with movie science fiction & science fantasy celebrities and information. Our 4 y/o and 7 y/o boys didn\"t want to leave! IMAX and the water park on the first floor",
          "We loved the Popnology exhibit. This really illustrates that scientists as dreamers results in helpful technology for all. There are so many items that we have discarded and replaced that had origins from science fiction. They dreamed it then the engineers built it and we",
          "I would highly recommend taking the trek downtown with family to see this wonderful Science Center. Check ahead to be aware of upcoming special exhibits. The center is well done and perfect for a family outing. If summertime, it is cool indoors so a perfect summer field trip!",
          "We like the traveling exhibits. The first one we went to was Body World or Works. It was fascinating. There are many other exhibits of interest in this center. Children are especially treated with lots of exhibits that are hands on.",
          "We got a year membership from Groupon because it was cheaper than just for the day visit. We went especially to see the football exhibit they had last year. We took our college kids this past month and they had more fun playing and seeing all the science exhibits even at their",
          "Every time I come here, I make sure I bring the kids. I even come alone! Great way to learn science, or walk exhibits! So interactive!",
          "This was the third time we have visited the Arizona Science Center. Every time we have all had fun including are young toddler son. There is always new exhibits and good shows in the planetarium. We bought a family membership and plan on going every time we visit Phoenix. Fun",
          "This is an average science museum. I have been to several that are much better, and one that was worse.",
          "The museum is very interesting and well maintained. It was a great place to have a conference reception and networking session.",
          "We visited here for the first time on a rainy Monday. My 10 and 8 year old loved it! There were plenty of exhibits and hands on centers to keep them entertained. We also paid to see the Dinosaur exhibit and Saturn movie. Both boys enjoyed the Dinosaurs and both did not like",
          "The Arizona Science Center is big on the outside, but small on the inside. This is because even though admission costs $18, half the exhibit space is dedicated to things that cost extra. Want to see the main exhibition? That's an extra $12 after you've paid $18. Planetarium",
          "The exhibits permanent and temporary are great for all family, you could spend a whoe day there, Just beware of parkmeters, if you forget the time you will get fine!",
          "I went with two kids aged 18mo & almost 5 knowing that the museum is geared toward older kids. I went only because I had free entrance for all (under 3 is free). Both enjoyed the \"Playing with water\" area (forgot the name) the best..this is something you'd also expect at the",
          "I've taken kids here for field trips several times since becoming a day camp coordinator, and they never disappoint. Last month, they had snow outside, which was an awesome thing for kids from the desert to play in! I also really liked that the snow day was included in general",
          "Wish we had longer. We love science centres and this one did not disappoint. We opted to watch two shows at the planetarium; One about black holes which was brief but interesting and one about Saturn which was longer and featured a wonderfully nauseating \"space roller coaster\"",
          "The Arizona Science Center was a nice experience for my kids who went to the Center specifically to see a Dinosaur Exhibit. They didn't feel like the dinosaur exhibit offered a lot in return for their entry. For a $6.00 admission, the entire exhibit took 15 minutes and the kids",
          "We've been to many of these types of places and have one in our hometown. It's on par with others we've seen and in some ways better. The body exhibit was really well done and interesting and engaging. The dinosaur exhibit is more art than science but if you are prepared ahead",
          "The Arizona Science Center does possess some good hands-on exhibits for kids. Though I have a year membership, I do not see myself going more than once a year. Check Groupon for discount memberships if interested.",
          "This is a very well laid out museum. Most of the exhibits are fully interactive, and there is a lot of room to play with everything. Clean, easily accessible, and friendly staff made our visit easy and fun. The planetarium was well worth the extra fee. Parking was a breeze in",
          "This science museum has lots to see and do for children and science loving parents. There were demonstrations of sound and wave propagation that held the attention of many adults. Not to be too critical but the concrete facade of the planetarium is ugly and out of place for this",
          "We visited the Center on a Tuesday. There were 2 adults and 1 teen. We purchased our tickets with approx. 4.5 hours to see the Center. The person selling tickets advised us not to purchase any movie tickets until we viewed the exhibits. We really enjoyed all the displays and did",
          "We were visiting from out of town and spent a few hours here. This visit was me, my wife, and our 10 year old son. Everyone enjoyed the visit and learned a thing or two. Extremely interactive place. Clean and in good shape. A few attractions cost extra but not a ton and it makes",
          "The most fabulous thing about this amazing museum is that you can touch - almost everything!!! On top of that, they have a fabulous IMAX theater there and tons of activities all the time. This is fabulously fun whether you're bringing kids or not.",
          "This has been a family favorite for Years!! Buy a membership if you live in the Phoenix area! The year round exhibits are perfect for all ages, there are hands on areas for the kids and the visiting exhibits are Spectacular!",
          "My husband and my daughter 17 yr. old went there while I was at a conference at the Hyatt. They spent all day and had a great time! Would highly recommend for traveling families.",
          "The boys had a great time visiting. Lots of hands on exhibits for kids to play in. My 10 yr. old's favorite was the force and motion activities. My 6 yr. old enjoyed playing with everything that had buttons or levers. The home exhibit offered lots of hands on activities and",
          "I think this is a great place to spend 3-4 hours or more depending on your feet, quite a bit of walking but you can of course sit down and take breaks. Today we were not there as long as prior visits. The 9 year old I was with thoroughly enjoyed it. I think the 45 minute",
          "The place is great, probably no need to add to what others have said. We got a membership and it has already paid for itself in just a few visits. Our kiddo loves the AZ science ctr and that says a lot, for a kid who is not keen on \"educational\" fun. The demonstrations the",
          "We don't have kids but this was a fun afternoon anyway. The water section was awesome, we raced in wheelchairs, did some puzzles, laid on a bed of nails, and compared heartbeats with drums. The only thing that would make this place better is if there were no kids. It was hard to",
          "Enjoyed taking my children to the Science Center. The boys are 4 and 6 years old. They enjoy the water, flight, and body areas of the center. They especially like the poop slide. Good times.",
          "Lots of things to see and do with the kids! They had snow and the kids were having a blast! Very informational, we even had crafts and a contest.",
          "~ Always inspiring, educating, and entertaining scientists young and old with very cool interactive experiences.",
          "So much fun! As and adult, it is nice to go to a place like this and let out your inner child. I would definitely tell others to go here.",
          "I have not been to the AZ Science Center since they had remodeled it, I was very please with all the activities that were available for not just kids but adults. Two of us spent 4 hours there and left with a smile, we could have stayed longer if they weren't closing!",
          "We have a family membership. Always love going to the featured exhibits. Great for kids. Very educational.",
          "General admission, with no extras is not a great experience for an adult. This center is clearly aimed at kids. If you're adult, be prepared to pay for all the shows and special exhibits you can, or just skip this museum entirely.",
          "Took 10 & 9 yr olds here for a great afternoon. Loved all the exhibits and took in the IMAX and planetarium also. Kids (and Nana) had a great time.",
          "We brought the kids here for a 3D movie feature and were pleasantly surprised at the options available for younger children. We definitely plan on coming back so they can spend some time exploring the museum.",
          "Every time I go in thinking I know what to expect they have several new things set up. Been here 6-7 times over 10 years now and I always take visitors with me. Prices have gone up a bit high but you can see discounts every little bit on groupon and living social.",
          "This is a fantastic science center! My son (6 year old) especially loved the human body area, the outdoor water play area, making a functional paper airplane design and the water channel activity table. He was not bored for a second and we were there for hours. He",
          "Great science center, very hands on. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Great customer service and the exhibits are well done.",
          "I went on a Wednesday and there were a lot of field trip groups plus many kids younger than school age. A great place for kids to get a hands-on learning experience, but as a single adult, I didn't get much out of it. I would have liked to get more out of it.",
          "As a former teacher, I can tell you, this is the kind of experience that changes the imagination of a child from text book, to outside the box. Amazing experience and way cheaper than an amusement park.",
          "The only down side to this museum is that you have to pay for parking, which for Phx I guess is expected but it is a deterrent for me buying another membership. They do validate parking but if you actually spend time there you are looking at paying at least $8 in parking even",
          "Great place to take the kids on a hot summer day, and the field trips the kids have gone on have been very educational (for kids and adults). This place is cool! It's put together well, the kids seem to enjoy the overall experience and the ONLY thing I'd like to see is a",
          "This is a great place to take your children or your grand children. It will provide at minimum two to three hours of entertainment in the way of interactive exhibits along with workshops and demonstrations. My wife and I were fascinated and toured the center for two hours and",

          "This place was an overpriced kids playground. Anything that was \"fun\" for kids had a waiting line. At many exhibits there was nowhere for parents to sit and watch their kids, so the kids ran wild. I agree with other reviewers that this should be called a children's museum and",
          "We enjoyed our first visit here as there were a lot of things to do and see for our 6 year old. The variety of exhibits allowed for a few hours of non stop exploring and learning and the subjects covered a wide variety of interests. Wasn't a huge fan of the fact that you had to",
          "The AZ Science Center will appeal to most kids 2-14 (but adults will also learn a thing or two). It is a great venue, but my advice is to avoid the possibility of having a large number of field trips in February through June. We visited in early September, and we practically",

          "Great place to take your kids. Learning and playing at the same time. On the expensive side but check on Groupon they have deals all the time. I got a summer family membership for around $45, totally worth it. The food and gift shop are also kind of pricey. Don't forget to",
          "Great place to explore, especially during hot summer afternoons. We take the grandchildren and the adore it!",

          "Our group included two adults and two kids (12 and 14). Everyone found plenty to keep them interested without spending extra for the additional exhibits. We were at the museum for about three hours, and could have spent more time there if it wouldn't have closed at 5.",

          "We were pretty disappointed. Half or more of the interactive exhibits weren\u2019t working. If you\u2019re taking children just to learn it\u2019s fine, but to have fun while learning??? It wasn\u2019t worth the money.",
          "The Phoenix Art Museum is visually beautiful. The second Sunday of each month is free to visitors. There are special events that cost a minimum amount of money. We entered to 25,000 paper butterflies scattered along the walls and ceilings. \u2026",

The service is fast but I still suggest bringing food from home.",

Also too many extra costs for exhibits.",

          "Where is all the money they charge people going? Everything is old and broken. I use to come here when I was little about 13 years ago and it was the exact same thing when I brought my daughter. All together depressing overpriced and noisy.

          "Great exhibits with plenty of interactive engaging modes for kids from 3-95.  The price was steep but out membership at our hometown museum help buffer the damage. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to check out the sweet insect collection on the 4th floor!!",
          "I find it hard to believe that this is rated so highly.  Yes, there some good exhibits, brain, body, some physics, and the mirror maze.  However, for what it costs to visit this place, I expect everyone of these displays to actually work. \u2026",

          "4 levels of hands on exhibits for children. Parking is in a nearby garage and is $2 an hour with validation. Tickets are fairly pricey for something kids are done with in a couple hours. Only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is that this place is entirely for kids with very little depth. Teachers get in free.",
          "This would be a great place to bring kids. I just wish it was a great place to bring adults. Exhibits are hands-on but not too in-depth\u2014they\u2019re a little overly simplistic to appeal to kids. I learned some fun facts but was often left \u2026",

Groupon discounts available and the library offers culture passes giving free admission to many places including the science center.",

          "I thought it was just ok, It was smaller than I had expected. We went on one of the free weekends and there were so many people, it was kind of hard to enjoy. The exhibits were somewhat interesting and there were a lot of hands on \u2026",
          "The CREATE area is simply the most amazing place! Nick, RaeAnn, Jordan, Esther & Victoria are an amazing team of people who were ready and willing to help us be as creative as we wanted. They had the knowledge and excellent way of guiding \u2026",

          "I love it",
          "This place, first of all, is meant for a young audience. These science facts are basic, but still and fun environment to learn in. The outside ball water thingy is great. There's many other attractions to enjoy. The price is fairly well \u2026",

          "This place not worth to visit such a scam strategy once you pay for the admission ticket you will be surprised to know that you have to pay another ticket for exhibit, so if you think that's all you are mistaken, there is another additional \u2026",
          "Good for the whole family. Interesting exhibits! Lots of hands on exhibits too.",
          "Expensive, especially for a large family, but worth it. Parking extra. Lots of hands on activities and things to play with. Great for kids. Gift shop. Elevators to take you up and down the floors. Little restaurant. Lots of shows and special exhibits. Planetarium costs extra. IMAX costs extra. Some rides that cost extra.",
          "So with the mixed reviews and the overall rating of 4 stars I decided to go and check it out. Let\u2019s just say this is mostly for children and not adults. Not worth the price for admission. Even the planetarium show was a waste of time for adults.",
          "IF I COULD GIVE SIX STARS I WOULD. I've been coming here for 20 years on and off and this place never ceases to amaze me. There are SO many interactive exhibits, which is my number one favorite thing about coming here. So much fun. I learn \u2026",
          "Never stop wondering! This is the message of Arizona Science Center which  echoed through the period of my visit. The galleries, the featured exhibitions, the attractions and the planetary presentations are unique and extremely interesting. \u2026",
          "Participating in the program museum for all, you can get general entrance tickets for $3 if you have a ebt card up to four persons... AZ Science Center is a place where all the family can have fun at the same time that you are learning...I totally recommend it, a fun place where you can spend some quality family time!!!!",
          "The Pompeii thing was cool. But the children's displays for science center are all broken. hasn't changed in years. needs to be refurbished.",
          "This Pompeii exhibit was fun and was not over 100 or 50 dollars it was around 20 or 10 dollars. It was kinda boring and I personally thought they could've did better with the pricing.",
          "This place was ok. Something nice for the kids. Wouldn't mind coming again",
          "This place should be advertised as a children's museum, it has nothing interesting or educational for adults but they don't bother telling you that. Paid a non refundable $18 to walk around the incredibly small museum with nothing to do. \u2026",
          "The Pompeii exhibit, which is why I wanted to go to this museum, is taken down. A mirror maze will be replacing it starting June 30th. There are rooms with lessons about the human body (including a huge replica of a stomach, and information \u2026",
          "Too many screaming kids running around, actually bus loads and bus loads. The kids made so much noise we asked for refund. We no longer wanted kids running into us,  barging in front of use at exhibits so we got a refund and left quickly. The decibel level was intolerable.",
          "We absolutely loved the funny faces we were able to do on the computer. My kids were completely engorged in learning and how fun it was to learn different things while we were there.  It doesn't happen often with my children. It was nice to see them put away the phones and have a blast learning!!!",
          "My Family has gone for years and will continue for years to come",
          "We went to the Science Center to see the Pompeii Exhibit and spent $52.00 because we had to pay to get in as well and an additional $12 for parking. Way too much to spend for just wanting to see the Pompeii Exhibit. We walked around since \u2026",
          "The 3d movies and the Planetarium are awesome! Most the exhibits were broken and the MIRROR MAZE WAS A JOKE!!!!!!! THE MIRRORS WERE SO DIRTY WITH HAND PRINTS YOU KNEW EXACTLY HOW TO GET OUT! Prices are way to expensive for everything except movie and Planetarium.",
          "Awesome educational & interactive experience for the whole family. Watch Groupon for discounts on admission & family memberships which are a fantastic investment to have on hand during the long hot summers! They do a great job of keeping \u2026",
          "Its a great place to take the kids. It was hard to pull them away from exploring everything and we didn't have time to finish it all. I ended up getting the museum pass because I knew the kids wanted to come back. \n\nCon: You do have to pay \u2026",
          "this place is really cool. lots of fun things to do and learn with all sorts of interesting hands on exhibits. be wary of random unsupervised children climbing on exhibits, if you see this happening you are allowed to gently but extremely forcefully push them off. my favorite part is the part with the water stuff and things.",
          "75% lame, 20% fun for kids, 5% is actually interesting. Also, admission only gets you in the door, the good stuff costs extra.",
          "Great place for kids and adults, Planetarium is amazing.. can\u2019t see everything in a single day.",
          "Still a pretty nice place to take the kids. They loved it. For adults, I recommend the body worlds exhibit when it comes around again. The planetarium was pretty cool. The cafe inside is good but overpriced. ",
          "It could be a nice place if their displays worked. Most of which was broken making it hard for kids to actually explore the exhibits which is supposed to be part of the appeal of the science center.",
          "A lot of the exhibits are broken and the closest parking garage is $12. You have to pay extra for any of the special exhibits. Its a neat experience to go once though.",
          "Visited the Pompeii Exhibit. Exhibit was good, but pretty small for the price, especially considering it required regular admission as well. \n\nWhat was shocking is how little of the regular exhibits are left. I visited many times as a kid, \u2026",
          "PATHETIC!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!\nI wish I could change this to 0 stars. This was an awful experience for my boyfriend and I yesterday. Most of the science stations had broken material that was sticky and not clean. We tried doing one \u2026",
          "Really fun, lots of hands-on experiments and activities for budding scientists to explore. If you can, do stay for some of the live demonstrations. The host was lively and kept everyone focused on learning. While pricey, it was worth it.",
          "This is a great place to spend all day if you wanted to. You can buy lunch (kinda pricey) at their cafe inside. I love that the exhibits change often to keep kids interested in going back again. I don't know how they keep everything so \u2026",
          "This center is incredible. I'm a science teacher and I will be taking my kids here.",
          "The science e center is a great ever changing and evolving entertainment and educational activity for all ages. It is geared towards children but they bring many great activities for adults too. Parking can be a bit rough down town \u2026",
          "They advertise there is a mummy exhibit but after paying 60.00 for a family of 4 you find out to see the mummies(the reason you came in the first place) you pay an additional fee\ud83d\ude33",
          "I had a really good time. There were a lot of interactive things and is definitely a place I recommend you take the family too. I went on a Groupon but the regular non member prices seem a bit expensive. The shark exhibit would've been cooler with a shark tank. I'd go back though.",
          "Great place for kids, not so great for adults. While the simulations are colorful and interactive, many of them are dirty, worn down, and stained with years of wear and tear. Several exhibits were inoperable, and the videos at many stations \u2026",
          "Very disappointed. Several exhibits didn\u2019t work. Had my grandchildren, main elevator was not working to get the stroller to the upper floors. Had several hand sanitizers throughout the exhibits, none of which had any sanitizer in them. Considering everything is hands on, sanitizer would have been nice.",
          "I'm surprised anyone would give the science center less than five stars. Yes, I've been to Chicago, and New York but this is here, Phoenix. Once you slow down and engage, there's a lot to learn!  And there's something for all age groups. Great for everyone!",
          "Awesome place awesome displays /exhibits great place for children",
          "Staff was friendly and helpful but they are cramming way too many people in the Pompeii exhibit. It was almost suffocating. You didnt feel like you could take the time to read a description of the pieces on display because there were so \u2026",
          "I've been coming for years, but today we came for the Pompeii Exhibit. Stunning, as expected, yet sobering. Highly recommend!",
          "Visited with my 10-year old Daughter while in Arizona for Spring Break at the end of March 2016. The planetarium was awesome with a very knowledgeable guide. The POPnology exhibit was going on while we were there. I absolutely loved, loved \u2026",
          "My family purchased a membership off of Groupon and have been here a few times. My son is six and also attended the summer camp last year. He loves going and trying all of the exhibits. I like that it's exposing him to science but it gets \u2026",
          "About a third of the exhibits are broken or nonfunctional. Another third are just plain worn out or missing pieces. When a six-year-old can notice this and complain about it, that\u2019s pretty bad. The lunch place is all super-healthy joke food. Eat before you go or after you leave. Both kids hated it.",
          "We had a family membership for 6 at the Minnesota science meuseum, we were told it was good for many other locations across the country however when we got here they said it was only good for 4 of us. So we paid for two children. Then we \u2026",

          "This place is a fun, interactive and education place for all ages. It's a very interesting place to learn and have a good time. The only issue is I was really bummed that our ticket didn't work for the planetarium, I really wanted to go in! But the experience can really add up $$$$.",
          "Had a great time checking out the many exhibits with my family. We're in town from N.Y. and were intrigued by the Pompeii exhibit, leading to a full day of enjoyment by a bunch of late 20s early 30 year olds acting like schoolchildren on a \u2026",
          "I didn't have a chance to pack myself a lunch but I did my kids. And I'm so grateful I did. This sandwich and salad costs me $9 \n\nPackaged salad. And cheap sandwich that was not good. \n\nI am grateful because I used the Musuems For All \u2026",
          "Terrific for kids and adults.",
          "Great place for kids 5+ be prepared to spend a good amount of time there. Get parking validated when entering.",
          "I think that the fact they have small kids on display as mummy's is pretty messed up I don't need to see dead baby's just my thoughts",
          "Lots of fun things to do here, both as a kid and the kid-at-heart. Be sure to visit all four levels as well as sit in for the live demonstrations. Next time I'll definitely watch a planetarium show!",
          "This museum is fantastic! Sure, it's a bit pricey, but well worth it! The 3D theater is large, and has good 3D effects. The planetarium was okay, I wouldn't recommend the \"Super Volcanoes\" show, they only show C.G.I volcanoes and it's \u2026",
          "Spent 2-3 hours in the Pompeii exhibit at ASC. Can't say enough about the multimedia displays, videos, reconstructions, artifacts, and absolutely amazing overall display of this historic event. Well done, lots learned and will be remembered!",
          "Blah, is the best way to sum up this place. It opens at 10am except the water feature outside is at 10:30?? That doesn't make any sense. It cost $75 for me, my wife, and kid to go, that included the Solar System show in the planetarium, I \u2026",
          "I highly recommend this place for the entire family. Try and do everything so you don't miss any of the good stuff, had a blast with the family.",
          "Good, but the Pompeii exhibit was kinda expensive. Not much. Apparently chose the exact day that an Alhambra school came. It was spacious enough to accomodate all of us.",
          "This would be a great spot if you have children but I thought for the price of admission for two adults ($36 plus parking fees) it was a waste of my time and money. The dinosaurs in motion exhibit looked really neat but I was not going to \u2026",
          "I\u2019ve been to lots of science centers or kids zones but honestly I\u2019m truly impressed at the amount of things there was for my two year olds to touch, hold, pull, pull, engage, and learn from. Highly recommend. \n\nI recommend eating before \u2026",
          "Great place for all ages. I'm an engineer and I find myself learning something new each time I visit. I love the planetarium and IMAX showings. The Arizona Science Center makes Science fun for everyone. ",
          "An excellent place for kids to spend a hot summer day!  The only downside is that it would be nice to have some new material once in a while.  If more activities rotated, it would be more likely for people to visit more than once.",
          "Great family fun that will keep you busy the whole day.",
          "I love coming here with a friend or family member to spend some time learning about new things related to science! Great place to visit if you're in the area.",
          "I took my kids (6, 7 & 10) here and they said that they had fun but it is far too expensive if you're paying full price and still too expensive if you're getting some sort of deal on the tickets. On top of that you'll probably be paying for \u2026",
          "This is a very cool place for the kids and the family. My girls (6 and 8) absolutely loved being \"hands on\" with the exhibits. The storm simulator was my favorite - really cool to \"feel\" the different effects as the floor shakes and water \u2026",
          "I've been coming here since I was 4 years old myself and I'm happy to say my kids come here now and love it just as much as me. It keeps my kids entertained for hours. Definitely recommend this place! I've never had a problem!",
          "Cool spot. Came out feeling like Bill Nye, you know, the Science Guy. Teachers get in free. Very interactive. Make sure you get your parking validated. ",
          "The South Pacific movie was awesome.  Also enjoyed the animation exhibit, we go about once a year and should go more often, 5 stars for the kids.",
          "A message to ASC - I want a refund of our admission equal to the amount of interactive displays in disrepair. I reckon 15+% will suffice. Always excellent concepts for engagement and learning, but it is seriously bordering on ghetto. Have \u2026",
          "Its is amazing and fun and I really loved it. My favorite thing is the airplane simulator where you can control the airplane and fly it through obstacles",
          "Very disappointed.  We went with grandkids for the fourth time in about 6 years.  The exhibits are the same as six years ago, only dirtier and inoperable in several cases.  Made us wonder what the center does with its donations if exhibits \u2026",
          "it is fun the 1st couple of times . also they don't change anything except the top room monthly and you have to pay to get in. the planetarium is cool  and they have some fun live shows.",
          "Disappointing. Wanted to see the Pompeii exhibit but found out it would cost $110 dollars to see it because we would have to pay general admission one another special exhibit fee. They can keep their petrified corpses. We're having fun at Tilt Studio at AZ Mills!!",
          "I guess since I'm from Missouri it caught me off guard when the admissions was very expensive to me. ( almost I believe 40$ for 6 people ) I did enjoy some parts of the center. Most of the station looked gross to touch and majority were \u2026",

Horrible of them to conveniently leave nuclear power out of their power generation display even though they have Palo Verde, a 3875 MW generation station, just a short drive to the west.

          "My family and I did not care for this museum.  In defense of the museum, we didn't explore the IMAX or planetarium.  The worst part is that the museum is full of potential.  There are a number of great interactive exhibits but very little \u2026",

        "wiki": "Castles N' Coasters is an amusement park and family amusement center located in Phoenix, Arizona. The approximately 10-acre (40,000 m2) park features four outdoor 18-hole miniature golf courses, several rides, and an indoor video game arcade. \nThe park was built in 1976, and is designed in a Middle-Eastern motif though other eras are featured such as the Wild West-themed miniature golf course and log flume ride.\nOther attractions includes a go-kart track, bumper cars, bumper boats, 2 roller coasters called Patriot and Desert Storm, some thrill rides including Magic Carpet, Sea Dragon, Free Fall and Sky Diver drop rides, and a log flume called Splashdown.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1976, the entertainment park originally opened under the name \"Golf n' Stuff\". It later turned into \"Castles N' Coasters\" in 1992 after adding its Ride Park. Also expanding to 10 acres which brought two roller coasters, Desert Storm and Patriot, as well as a multilevel arcade.\n\n\n== Rides and attractions ==\nDesert Storm is a looping roller coaster that uses a simple lap bar restraint.  It is one of the park's main attractions and has two loops. Manufactured by, Hopkins.\nPatriot is a mild roller coaster that is colored red, white and blue as its name suggests.  It is centered around a large American flag and does two circuits. Manufactured by Hopkins.\nSplashdown is a log flume.  It features a logging town, tunnel, waterfalls, fountains, squirting African Elephant statues, native huts, and two large drops. The first drop measure 10 feet and the second drop measures 30 feet.\nSky Diver is a 120 foot tall free-fall drop tower.\nFree Fall is a smaller version of Sky Diver (above).\nSea Dragon is a large swinging Viking ship. Manufactured by, Chance.\nRam Rods are bumper cars.\nMagic Carpet is a music express.  It goes through \"Aladdin's Castle\" and goes forward and backward.\nCarousel\nLi'l Indy is a go-cart track that passes under the Desert Storm roller coaster (above).\nBumper Boats\nFlying Bugs & Spinning Tops are kiddie rides located near the queue line for Desert Storm (above).\nDixie Jr. Wheel is a miniature Ferris wheel.\nArcades\nMiniature Golf features four courses.  Each have trick shots, multiple themes, and many water features.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nOn May 1, 2005, eleven people were left stranded for nearly three hours after a free fall ride malfunctioned. Reports indicate that the floorless, four-sided passenger cabin jerked as it ascended the tower. The cabin, guided by cables, normally drops to the bottom of the 120-foot-tall tower and comes to a stop, however when it reached the halfway point on its ascent, it made loud screeching noises and came to a sudden halt. It took firefighters nearly three hours to rescue the riders, who were locked in their seats about 30 feet above the ground.\nThe park's manager says that the ride will be closed until investigators determine what caused the malfunction.\n\"We don't know what happened,\" he said.\nOn March 30, 2015, two young boys suffered burns when the bumper boat they were in caught fire.On November 28, 2015,  a twelve-year-old boy named Dominick Leal was seriously injured after falling from a water log flume ride called: the \"Splashdown\" after standing during the ride, and required immediate emergency brain surgery.On June 6, 2019, three young boys were found to have defecated in a fountain on the Splashdown ride.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCastles N' Coasters Official Website\nCastles N' Coasters at the Roller Coaster DataBase\nDetails with images",

          "We haven't been here in 5-6 years, but went back for a couple hours one night recently when visiting from out of town. There is a ton to do here, and nothing has really changed in 5-6 years. No new rides. Go carts seemed a little slow compared to other places, but great mini",
          "The arcade has a nice selection of pinball, video games, air hockey, etc. You can buy an unlimited game card which seems like the best method. I bought one card and 5 kids used it for an hour. You have to wait like 30 seconds between swipes, but its not a big deal. I picked",
          "Had a great time playing mini golf with grand kids. The holes were easy to maneuver and the kids had a great time. Also were able to play laser tag afterwards inside.",
          "We have a blast every time we go!!! We go often. It can be a bit pricey but hey it\u2019s fun for the kids. Mini golf is fun also.",
          "We went on a beautiful Monday hoping to go on some rides, but only the miniature golf and the arcade were open. It was our fault for not checking ahead of time, but \"Coasters\" is in the name of the place, so we thought the rides would be open all the time. 2 of the 4 golf",
          "This is a gem of a small amusement park, located right in the middle of the city. My kids judged the roller coaster to be \"really cool\", and our nine-year-old did nine trips on it before she was ready to quit. It has a reasonably small number of other rides, with some rides",
          "We weren\u2019t sure what to expect when we went. We had 4 children ages 7-13 and everyone enjoyed it. We thought it was just arcade and coasters but the ropes course was a huge hit. They loved being up so high and doing the zip lines. We spent hours there and would happily",
          "We whent for our twins birthday they were 26 we stayed for 4 hours did most everything great place to go",
          "Family oriented amusement park. Various activities for all ages. Was in town visiting family and just happen to stop by to check out all the noise. I myself enjoyed the rides with my grand daughters. Definetely will be back next time to play some miniature golf.",
          "My family had a blast. We did a miniature golf course. It was fun and they had 3 more available. My kids are 6 and 8 and they were able to ride everything they wanted except one. My 6 year old is an adrenaline junkie so she was totally geeked when she could ride the biggest",
          "We stayed in Scottsdale for a week for spring break and decided to take our kids here for a day of fun! Our kids are 8 and 11. I feel like this park is PERFECT for this age. My 8 year old was just tall enough to ride everything! There are 2 major things I loved about this",
          "What do you do for your teenagers birthday party, go to castles and coasters. It's good outdoor, exercise, clean fun. Let them disconnect and move around. Lots of rides and games. You can keep costs down by bringing your own water and having the kids go to the car to get it. On",
          "Nice mini golf course and arcade. None of the rides were open, a little disappointing. Had trouble finding someone to help us.",
          "Had fun times here (Golf and Stuff) in middle school back in the day and still having fun times now! Even though Metro Center has seen better days, Castles and Coasters has held up. Mini golf courses and still maintained and fun. Great deals on 3 hour at the arcade are also fun",
          "We decided to try this place as a local alternative to a small theme park. We were not expecting a lot from it, so we were not let down. This place has definitely seen some years, but it is not in disrepair. We were surprised how busy it became as the night went on. Basically,",
          "good fun for kids.. and adults.. lots of video games inside.. rollercoasters in phx.. no travel to cali.. golf is fun/ hilarious",
          "This was are 2nd time here , kids had fun with mini golf and the arcade . We didn\u2019t do rides this time but did last time with no issues",
          "We had a blast! Lots to do and something for everyone! We went on New Year\u2019s Eve! They were open till 5 am! That\u2019s so awesome when you have teenagers! Staff were really friendly! What a way to ring in the new year!",
          "I took children here a couple of years ago. The goofy gulf is fun. The rides are OK but certainly don't compare to real amusement parks in Ca. Worth a few hours with the kids.",
          "Every attraction is worth it! The rides, the games, the golf, the memories. Well worth it. If its your 1st date, or every date, this is a sure bet",
          "We went when they had a 3 hour unlimited play for $10. That's was perfect for our 8 year old. He ran around and played so many games we couldn't keep up with him. Great place.",
          "This is fun place for all ages. Played 2 rounds of mini golf and had heaps of fun. Everyone around was having a ball of a time. Lots of people lots of games and rides. Recommend this place",
          "My son's workplace rented this amusement park for all the employees with their immediate families and everything was paid for. We use to take our kids to this park when they were in elementary school; now they are adults and one of them was taking us, which is funny! The park",
          "This is a pretty fun amusement park. It's small compared to others - two roller coasters, bumper cars and bumper boats, viking boat, mini golf, carousel, arcade, go-karts, and magic carpet. There's a little area for smaller children with three or four kid's rides. There's a",
          "Took two teenagers there for something to do for the day and ended up enjoying it myself. The prices are good and they had much more to do than I expected. Had fun on all the rides, playing in the arcade, the miniature golf course, and even did the obstacle course and zip line",
          "We went on an evening date during the week to play miniature golf. It was not crowded and very clean. The staff informed us as to which courses were more difficult. It was a great experience!",
          "Enjoy ourselves everytime we go here. We love to play the mini golf and we can get competive. :-) LOVE this place, and reasonably priced.",
          "Took my nieces and nephew here and they had an AWESOME time! The price was just right! Not alot of people (we went during the week) so the lines were light!",
          "I took my sister here for a New Years' Eve special they had running that was a cheap ride all you can night, she was too young to drink so this was the best option and it was wonderful. There aren't too many rides at this attraction, however, the view from atop the \"skydiver\"",
          "Excellent place to take the kids. They'll love you forever. Fantastic rides, and attractions. The castle area is clean, well cared for. Carnival like foods, drinks,snacks, galore. Great variety, for all ages.",
          "Came here w a 7yr old and she had a blast! It was at the end of July and hot as .... We swam at our hotel and came at 5pm hoping for lower temperatures lol It was still so hot but we found relief with these huge gargantuan fans that spray water and chilly air. We bought the",
          "Game selection nice ... just feels ... sleazy. Not to say that your kids won't like it, just that it needs to be steam cleaned, updated and lit better.",
          "We took some Boy Scouts to an outing here and they had a blast. Prices were decent since they had a summer special. They enjoyed the rides and the arcade. It was a little too hot for mini golf but they enjoyed the rest of the park.",
          "It was a last minute decision to go here after a day of swimming and I'm so glad we did. Friend really wanted to do the rope course, which opened at 5pm due to the high heat. Rope course included a zip line, which my 12 year old Godson had been wanting to do all summer.",
          "This is a classic amusement park/arcade experience. Play have go carts, bumper boats, fair rides, etc. this is not Disneyland. However, it is a great fine in the classic sense.",
          "Our group went here and had a blast! Yes, it was summer in Phoenix, and so yes, the outdoor activities were quite hot. They only had two outdoor rides open (bumper boats and go-karts), but it kept us busy. The mini-golf courses were a lot of fun! Very well decorated. Had a ton",
          "This isn't the newest or best amusement park but they do have a good variety. There is an arcade, mini golf, roller coasters and a few other things I can't recall. Good entertainment for the kids locally if you can't get out of state to Six Flags or another theme park.",
          "We went two hours before it was closing time on a Monday night. No lines and the staff was very friendly. We only had a chance to ride the adult rides so we'll take the kids back to ride and play some games!",
          "It has a mini golf park, and as you can see it also has a roller coaster, it has many activities to see and do",
          "My family went as something to escape the heat. We got a 3 hour unlimited play pass for $15 had a blast. There were 3 floors of machines of a huge variety. They did neglect to tell us that by getting these types of pass we don't actually earn the tickets the machine says. But",
          "This place is huge!! And has lots of activity or everyone in the family. Even if you don't have kids this is a great play to just have fun and hang out ... we loved the race track and the mini golf \u26f3\ufe0f",
          "spent a couple of hours there. we all had a great time. lines were not that long so was very enjoyable. water log ride seemed to be the biggest hit with the kids",
          "I love this place! There is so much to do for the whole family. Every time my family and I go we play miniature golf and we have a blast. I'm always asking myself, why don't we do this more often? Even my older kids in college love it. Next time we visit I am going to try the",
          "We were visiting the area from out of town and decided to have a family fun night. The amusement park is small but fun especially in the evening when it cools down a little. My six year old had a blast riding all the rides with me since she is tall enough to do them all with a",
          "Mini golf was super fun. We were doing all the courses and then we did the arcade ride were it felt like you were living a scary experience. There was also a go kart track which was fun but the cars were kind of slow and it was hard to turn but the track was awesome. Fun place",
          "I don't come here for the Roller Coasters or the great putt putt golf or even the go karts..I have been enjoying this place strictly for the game room in the castle.for 30 years on and off now...I lived in Phoenix for 6 yrs and visit every year or so and I make this place a",
          "This place has a lot for family entertainment. There are 3 or 4 mini golf courses in addition to the roller coaster, bumper cars and other rides. There is an obstacle course and an arcade and the kids have lots of fun!",
          "We wanted to do something different for the day so we decided to take the kids here. It was nothing special at all. The park was very old and small. We didn't play mini golf but I wish we had. That might have been the best part. For the money, I know I will not be going back.",
          "4 mini golf courses, which were well maintained. A very large arcade that our kids loved. Didn't try the roller coasters, but they were popular and looked nice. Bumper boats were a hit as well. Not too pricey.",
          "We are visiting from the Chicago area to see some spring training baseball and we decided to go here after the game. From the outside it doesn't look like like much, very small but when we went in the golf course bus laid out very nicely. There are four courses but we were only",
          "Though I live in North Phoenix, not too far from Castles & Coaster, I had only ever driven past. That changed, when family visited us here. We were a group of 3 adults, a teenager and a special needs youngster. Actually, three of the group (2 adults and the teenager) had been to",
          "My family had fun at Castles N Coasters. It was cheap and had lots to do. My family enjoyed the go karts, bumper boats, and roller coaster the most.",
          "Family of 4 (kids 8 and 10) went here during our spring break trip. Played one of the courses of mini golf on a beautiful evening (Course 1 if I recall correctly). Our course wasn't terribly busy and most everything was fine. However, balls kept getting stuck on the holes",
          "If you enjoy long lines, around people you really dont want to be around unarmed, and spending a ton of money this is the place for you!! You can bring your kids but bring sanitary wipes as well....Make sure you eat ahead of time.",
          "I just went to Phoenix with two of my kids (16 and 11). It was our final afternoon and we were looking for something to do, and ended up here. Hugely pleasantly surprised. I've been to dozens of amusement parks all over the world. This was definitely one of the smaller ones,",
          "Phoenix is known for it's great golfing, and Castles and Coasters is no exception. We took a group of kids here from a hockey tournament. Was able to have a kids golf tournament and an adults tournament. Prices were fair, and the grounds were a good challenge, and good",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed playing putt putt golf here! Many courses to choose from. Although it was very wet when we visited - we had a great time! The holes are very detailed - it's very picturesque. This location is close to the airport, dining & other attractions. There are many",
          "Our kids enjoyed having bday parties here up through middle school. There are also small rides for young children. Many video games. Not in the best area but no need to be afraid.",
          "Had one of our many Grandson's party there when he turned 8. This is a fun place to go with the family. Somewhat expensive to get in but thank God for Groupon..",
          "We had a lot of fun playing miniature golf a few days ago. The course was interesting and challenging. Everything was very clean and well laid out. There were several different courses to play.",
          "This was great place for a afternoon. They had 4 different courses related to you skill. We did the level 1. Even with that said the course had a lot of intersting holes.",
          "We had such a good time with this putt putt course. There are 4 courses and if you do not let your ball go in the 18th hole, you can do all four but after two sets, we were tired of it. It is clever and not as easy as it looks! The coasters were not going today as it was a",
          "Went here a long time ago when the kids were young. I remember the coaster stopped mid way up a hill which was a little scary...but all was okay and the kids loved it.",
          "I liked the size of the amusement park because it was easy to keep track of the kids and feel like you could let the older ones go on their own. Rough crowd. Decent rides. A little overpriced. Kids liked the food.",
          "Fun day of for kids and staying active. Its hot in Phoenix so I recommend attending only night time or not warm seasons. They also have a enclosed area with AC for all the video games. You can enjoy your birthday party here. They have food too. Lots of restaurants near by.",
          "This is a fun little park that's good for a family outing. You can go in a roller-coaster, play mini golf, and overall have a good time. Not too expensive, either.",
          "We are visiting from out of country with another family and we're trying to find something to do with our 5 kids ranging in age from 6-12. This park was perfect! The price was extremely affordable and the variety of rides was just what we were looking for to keep our kids",
          "I brought 6 kids ages 15-4 to check out Castles and Coasters for the first time since moving to Arizona. What a JOKE! First off, their height requirement signage is NOT universal. That made me furious when my 4 1/2 year waited patiently in line at a ride where she clearly was",
          "The best parts were the mini golf and ropes course. They have 4 mini golf courses. The best ones we found were #3 and 4 as they were a bit more challenging and had more secret holes. We also did the zip line and tried some of the other rides. The go karts were the longest",
          "Nice place when lit up in the night. My family and I were considering a visit at this place but after seeing the crowd attending (young folks) we changed that decision and only took pictures.",
          "I took my Granddaughter to this location while in Phoenix. We tried playing golf, but it was pretty hot so we went inside after a while. The golf area was well laid out and in good condition though. The arcade is very big and there is something for just about any age. And the",
          "The mini golf is straight out of the movies, huge arcade, decent food, fun for every age! We love going here!",
          "We were in town visiting our family and our hotel was across the street. We had asked the grandchildren would they like to go there and they were all fot it. The hotel provided a discount coupon which saved us alot. It also had one free round of golf for our family of four. The",
          "Younger children will enjoy this more than teens. Typical amusement park food, easy access via interstate.",
          "I loved this park. It was such a good size, and the coasters and mini golf were very well orginized and fun for everybody. The arcade was a little crowded when I went there; but the selection of games was amazing, there was at LEAST 45 arcade games; they were a little pricy but",
          "My kids love it here we go when it starts getting dark and stay till it closes. There are a lot of rides and a huge arcade.",
          "They arent bad considering there size. I give much props to them for continuing to try to make the place better. They have been around for such a long time! Ill continue to support them!",
          "It is an older park but defiantly still a fun place to go for the day. There are a bunch of different rides to chose from. I took the kids during spring break and the lines were not as bad as I thought they would have been.",
          "Needed to kill some time before my flight and after eating at Bobby Q, I decided to come here. Cool arcade but the prices are a bit high for what it's worth. Most games are a $1+. The old school arcade games (mortal Kombat, area 51, NFL blitz, etc.) are fortunately a quarter.",
          "I did not do any of the rides or have anyone I was with play in the arcade, but mini golf is fun. Good for groups, older children, could even see as a casual date. You can play in the evening, as it is lit up.",
          "If you love video games, this is a great way to cool off in the hot summer. Take advantage of the Mon. - Thurs. $10 for 3 hours of gaming. We mini-golfed in the evening although it was still quite hot! In cooler weather, the all day ride pass is worth the fun family memories",
          "I have gone here for decades and now take my kids here. The value is great, rides are good and safe, and they've upgraded and added attractions over the years. Birthday parties are nice here, as well. Recommend for ages 4-15 or so...",
          "Nice place with lots of fun activities with fairly good prices (at least by New York standards like I'm used to), though it may be expensive for the area since each individual thing you want to do has a cost attached. Went for mini golf and it was nice (balls kept getting lost",
          "We went there to celebrate my twin nephews for there 11th birthday party. The kids had fun, and we also had fun",
          "i recommend castles n coasters for teens. they have a lot of video games, sky walk, a roller coaster, bumper cars, a lot of other fun stuff to do. IT NOT CHEAP THOUGH, so if you do go early enough so you have time to do everything and get your moneys worth. the lines at the",
          "This is a must do every time I visit Phoenix! There are 4 mini-golf courses and all are fun! My friends and I had fun and laughed a lot.",
          "I remember going to this place as a kid when all there was was a miniature golf course and an arcade. Now, my 7 year old rode the Desert Storm roller coaster over and over again until I came up and pulled him off. My 4 year old loved the log ride.",
          "Our family decided to make the trip up to Castles~N~Coasters. It was well worth the drive. There are so many rides for all the kids and when it gets too warm outside, we would ride a water ride or go into the arcade, it's nice and cool and huge. We will be making another trip",
          "Phoenix eye sore. This place should have been removed many years ago. Took some of my younger family members here and I wouldn't have them on any of the rides because they looked old and uncared for extreme disappointment.",
          "The mini golf was fun, there are 4 different courses so you can play a few rounds and not get bored. I have not done anything else here, but it all looks pretty fun.",
          "Not the biggest amusement park but great place to take the kids for several hours. There's an arcade, with video games from our youth up to today's offerings, snack bar, and 4 putt putt golf courses plus tradition amusement rides such as the roller coasters, bumper boat, go",
          "I loved going here as a kid. It is still just as fun now that I'm an adult. My wife and I took our 13 year old today and witnessed something truly rare, she was smiling!! It was good to enjoy some of the rides from my youth with my family, and I was impressed with the new",
          "Fun place to hang out with the family or friends. There's a little bit of everything, go carts, mini golf, arcade, food court, amusement rides and flying lines.",
          "we played mini golf and went on the boat ride it was a lot of fun. the ropes course was closed when we were there, I really wanted to try it.",
          "the go karts brakes suck and got kicked off for 1 whole day when i rode on them. when i was using the go karts.",
          "The rides are a bit pricey. Get the wrist band if you can. I've never been there when ALL the rides are working. The mini golf is geared toward younger putters, so take a little one with you for more fun. The arcade inside is pretty amazing tho. I love all the pinball games. The",
          "We came for my wife's office family party with young kids. The place fit well for our mix of family. There are plenty of rides for younger kids in either the kid areas or in sharing seats with larger adults. We hit just about everything - log ride, bumper cars, swinging",
          "I took my son who enjoyed the race cars. He would not get on the coasters. I did, and found them lacking in excitement and thrills. They are more carnival like, much like the park.",
          "Partner took me for a surprise on a sweltering Saturday. It seemed likeis was going to be very crowded and we would have to wait a long time. But to our suprise there were guest services personal that asked what we wanted to do that day and directed around to another area that",
          "We played mini golf and it was fun, there are a few courses you can do. There was a lot of different things there as well, indoor arcade, zip line, wire walking, mini theme park rides, among others.",
          "There are four 18-hole mini golf courses and you pay per course. The course was challenging and interesting but not terribly well maintained (the green was damaged in places and there were lots of tree debris in the way). It was about $7 for adults. There are also roller",
          "OK, I admit it - a guilty pleasure. We are middle-aged adults, but still had tons of fun at this place. The two mini-golf courses are very creative and fun, and we actually spent an hour or more in the arcade area playing classic video games like Galaga and The Simpsons. Felt",
          "Went there for a family fun day with a company. Price wise I can't really speak for as the company provided so much, but the staff and the attractions were great!",
          "WE took the teens to the amusement park and they were happy there for hours. They had plenty of rides and entertainment. We went during the evening hours so that the temperatures were a little lower and the sun not so hot. We stayed until almost 9 when it started getting dark.",
          "It used to be a fun place to go, however, the last two times I was there I felt so uncomfortable due to the clientele. They need some investment in staff training, hiring practices and security to shift the image to more family friendly and a clean environment.",
          "I went back and forth between 2 and 3 stars, because it was fun day. The place was pretty clean, not too crowded and prices were fine. Still, when you're a small amusement park with maybe 20 rides, and your big roller coaster and your flume ride are both broken you'd expect some",
          "This was our second time to the park. Kids love it. Desert Storm roller coaster was out of service the entire day...one of the workers said it was routine maintance but not entirely certain. We got 10% off entrance costs. Wish the entire park was \"non smoking\" to promote",
          "We went with a family group, including kids from 2 to 12. Prices were reasonable and ride offerings were diverse. I wish they had more for the 5 and younger crowd. The arcade games were fun for all. I feel the bathrooms could have been cleaner. Snacks foods were good, but",
          "Being a teen who rode some of the rids, I have a very blunt review: It was really awesome. The rides seemed dangerous but were definitely safe, and super fun! My top 3 rides were totally the swinging ship, the water log ride, and the 120-foot drop! My family and I participated",
          "Mini golf is cool, 4 choices of golf layouts. Bring a discount coupon with you or AAA card is honored, discounts can be found on flyers at most hotels.",
          "Me and my kids have been to many mini golf courses over different vacations and this is by far the best ever. Clean, exciting and challenging. All four courses are great.",
          "Played one round of mini golf on a Saturday night at about 7pm - myself, husband, and two teenage boys. We all agreed this was one of the nicest, most fun, challenging, unique, and well kept courses we have played in a very long time. It was pretty crowded and we had to wait",
          "Drove past here on our way into town and my daughter saw the roller coasters and started creaming. She loves ridding those things. I do not. Well a few days later we decided to take the kids here with their Uncle and a family friend. As it turns out the prices are not that bad.",
          "Great way to have a super fun day Love the tubing on a warm day kids had fun on the roller coaster and rides. the Go Carts are fun for all.",
          "Phoenix lacks family amusement. But this makes up for what is lost. It is a nice place for parties and family gatherings. It is also a nice place for a first date. The kids will love the arcade and the rides. I enjoy playing miniature golf with my girlfriends.",
          "Played two rounds of golf on two different courses, #3 & #4. Enjoyed each course. #4 was a little more challenging. Course was in good shape, but could use some updates in some places. Service was ok.",
          "We visited family and took our nieces and nephews here on a Sunday. We had ages from 17-28 along with older adults one aged 61! We had a fabulous time. We didn't get on any rides or play in the arcade as our mission was the miniature golf course. It was well maintained and",
          "Lots to do! Open spaces. Not a dull moment and the place was busy all the way to closing. Had a large video game arcade. A good time with my son.",
          "We had a little over an hour to kill and saw the roller coasters next to the mall, so we thought we could go over and just ride one or two of them, but its not for single rides or even a small pack of tickets that could be used fast because the lines are long too. You have to",
          "We took our two younger boys here for much of a day. There is a solid arcade with both ticket games as well as arcade games and air hockey, and so on. They have multiple mini golf courses and a variety of rides. Our kids loved them ages 7/5. I suspect if you were 10/11/12 it",
          "Everything here was absolutely filthy. The bathrooms were awful. Even the kids said this place stinks. That is pretty bad when you have rides.",
          "We spent most of the day with our grandchildren. It seemed like we enjoyed the rides much more then they did. The food was delicious too",
          "Took my 2-year old and although he had a great time, we are DEFINITELY taking him back when he's older and can do more!!!",
          "This is the 2nd year we have visited this park and have only utilized the mini-golf courses. They also have a roller coaster, bumper boats, zip line, wire walks, and other arcades activities. My husband and I enjoy the various obstacles and we have a friendly competition each",
          "This amusement park has something for everyone...it is a great place for children and adults...a must see,",
          "If it wasn't for the fun junior field trip groupers all over the park this would have been a lame excursion. There is one ride that thrills and one ride that gives your stomach a jump. The rest are not worth the price nor is the mini golf worth the expense. Eat elsewhere. This",
          "We had so much fun at this place! My children enjoyed going on all of the rides, with their favorite being the splashdown water log ride. It was so fun! They have rides for children of all ages. This is also one of the best kept mini-golf courses and it was a lot of fun with",
          "Our kids 8 and 9 and is had an amazing day at this amusement park! Price was great for what you get! we got a coupon in a brochure for $5 off each ticket. Came to $27 for the silver package which was unlimited rides and 18 hole mini golf! Great value!! Desert Storm is a great",
          "A good option to spend a day off with family and friends in Phoenix. We had a team outing few months back and it was a time well spent. There are multiple thrill rides for almost all age group - out favorite being the roller coaster (Desert Storm), Sky Diver, Splash Down and Sky",
          "Grandkids (ages 6-15) loved this place as there is something for all of them from the rides to the arcade. Spent five hours of never-ending fun for them and relaxation for us playing games at one of their picnic areas. Easy inexpensive way to spend the day with family or",
          "This place is the Bomb if you're into saving $$$ on rides, hotels and gas !! After many visits to Disneyland and making the drive and paying the exorbitant prices for entry and hotels and fuel we have found this place to be just as much fun for the kids and a whole lot closer",
          "This place is a rip-off. Don't go there on a Friday through Sunday. They give AAA discounts only Mon -Thur. They don't start the rides until after 5:00pm but will sell you the tickets prior to that and not tell you it doesn't open until 5.",
          "Was OK, We were alittle old for most items here. The mini golf was fun. The rides were for more kids and younger teens.",
          "There is only 1 roller coaster, bumper cars, go karts, a few smaller rides, a zip line, and mini golf. The worst part is the the game room has 3 floors, but no elevators or wheelchair ramps.",
          "Great place to take the kids of all ages. The place is at Metro Center which is a bit of a rundown place. But Castles N' Coasters is trying to stay up to date. Staff is friendly and there is a ton to do at this place! Priced a bit steep but worth it.",
          "So, no coasters were open. We mostly played video games which was fun for my kiddo. They had go carts open and mini golf but we didn't do either. It was a good value to pay $10 and have 3 hours of unlimited game play. This deal doesn't allow you to accumulate tickets, though,",
          "Our last day before flying home I gave the kids a break from hikes and museums and we went on rollercoasters. At $25 for an all day pass the value isn't too bad. The Desert Storm has two loops and it is pretty good. The height restrictions are low so everyone can ride. I",
          "Not a ton of people, so barely any line for the rides. It's a real nice place to visit, with awesome rides like the roller-coaster. It's wonderful how they managed to cram all those things in such a small space! The zipline and rope-course is fun, and the roller-coaster is",
          "The kids really enjoyed this experience and it wasn't too bad for the price. There was alot of people so the lines were a little long but it was still good fun. I would recommend to anyone looking to entertain kids/teenagers.",
          "Loads of fun and laughs for everyone! Young or old, well worth the visit and will fit in everyone's budget.",
          "After a very short time you will run out of things to do. Cars are slow, roller coasters are short, miniature golf is the only thing that will take any time.",
          "They gave a nice group rate for our party of 12 teenage boys. The place is safety conscious. Not in the best part of town, so I appreciated seeing security personnel. There is something for everyone; an arcade, variety of rides, zip-line...and snacks!",
          "Celebrated an untraditional Thanksgiving with my wife and two teenage sons at Castles N' Coasters. We took advantage of the holiday discount and spent the afternoon playing miniture golf and riding the rides. It's a small property that seems designed for families with children",

          "This place has a lot of variety however felt a little run down and over priced. We were in the U.S. For our 4th day and just arrived in Phoenix looking for a kids activity during the day. We stumbled across this place. The mini golf was the main attraction for us.",

          "Fun park. Took my 4 grandchildren, ages 10 - 14. Park had a go kart track, zip line, log ride, roller coasters, arcade, 4 miniature golf courses, bumper cars and also had food. Kids enjoyed the park very much. Park was clean, not trashy. Easy to get to. Located off of I-17. We",

          "Due to only being in Phoenix for 2 nights and our love of Crazy Golf this was high on our lists of places to visit. I checked the schedule a few days before and one of the days we were there had no closures due to parties so we planned to visit that day. We showed up early",
          "We took our 9 year old son for a few hours and wished we would have planned for more time. Not the cheapest place around ($3 water) but definitely the most fun. Some of the karts don't work so make sure you get in a good one. The lines on a Saturday ran about 30-45 minutes",
          "My 7 year old son loves this park. I let him choose between having a birthday party with 10 friends at Chuckie E. Cheese or bringing one friend here for the day and he choose to bring the friend. He has visited 3 times now and we stay well into the night.",
          "We went to Castles N' Coasters on Saturday, September 26, 2015. Admission is $30 per person but well worth the price. They have a great selection of rides - two roller coasters that will take your breath away - go-carts - bumper cars/boats - miniature golf - a zip line and rope",
          "Having recently visited Phoenix as the starting point for a road trip to San Francisco, we were looking for a kid friendly activity to start us off on the first proper day after arriving from England. Ideally we wanted to go to one of the 4 waterparks in the greater Phoenix",
          "This park is old and very outdated. The roller coaster seems very unsafe for smaller kids old enough to ride. There is not much to do and it was a bit pricy. Stay away on weekend nights as the crowd is not family friendly. They need a complete renovation and expansion for bigger",
          "It is fun for the kids - as there is not a lot else for them to do in Phoenix. However, it is in a poor neighborhood and most things there are completely outdated. They have not upgraded nor added to it in the last 9 years I have lived here. A lot of teenages come here to hang",
          "Came here Thursday evening and it wasn't crowded. My 5 year-old son didn't get on any rides but he watched. He was happy just to watch the rides in motion. We took our time walking and watching. Would be a great place to hold a birthday party.",
          "This is a very fun amusement park for older children and adults...although not much for toddlers to do there...friendly staff..some with a fantastic sense of humor...definitely worth the trip there!",
          "great amusement park theres stuff for the children and the teens worth the money it costs but.. its always to crowded and holds up everything and theres great hamburgers at a food court there",
          "We were visiting on vacation to Phoenix and took our 6 year old and 11 year old to this park. It's a nice local park with plenty of rides and entertainment to keep the kids busy. We went during the late afternoon and the price was good for $20 per person. We rode the log",
          "We were staying in Phoenix for one night traveling home from the Grand Canyon and just happened to drive right by this. My kids are on a big minigolf kick right now so we knew we had to stop. We did not try out the rides or arcade but the mini golf was very fun. The courses need",
          "I Really Liked the place itself with all the variety it had to offer, but I hated the crowds, Although; it did slow the pace a lot in playing mini golf leaving time for joking around.. lol A Very fun Mini-golfing area with snack-bar. The Arcade had new games and even as old as",
          "Took my grandchildren to spend the day at Castles and Coasters. This quickly became their favorite place to go.There are many amusement rides for all ages, there are video games, miniature golf and on top of it all,discount coupons can be obtained through the local Food city",

          "we had a blast on the rides, it is geared mostly for kids but fun loving adults had a fantastic time.",
          "This place is awesome for kids and adults alike. The golf courses are taken care of and well maintained. Lots of kids running around but what do you expect. Roller coaster seems okay.",
          "We took our son and daughter here April 25th as part of a work retreat. The rides were all open and the lines were shot because it was a private party. The kids went on every ride except the Skydive, zip line and obstacle course. The obstacle course looked like a lot of fun but",
          "We played mini-golf here when we were on vacation. There are 4 courses. Two easy and two hard. We played the hard course that was challenging but fun. I would highly recommend this fun mini golf course.",
          "Overall we had a great time here over spring break with our 3 boys. There weren't any lines to speak of so it was like the boys had the run of the park. We bought the \"silver\" pass so they could mini-golf and ride unlimited rides, and were a little disappointed it only allowed",
          "We have been coming to Phoenix for 6 years. And a trip to Castles and Coasters is a must for every visit. We always enjoy the miniature golf (they have four courses) and they have quite a collection of game inside. The staff is always cordial and we always have a good time.",

          "My girlfriend and I went to play some mini \u26f3 on a date and had a great time. The course is clean and fun. The lines were short so that made it a smooth process. The price wasn't terrible. Its about $7.99 er person. Great place to go for mini golfing",
          "Visited on vacation on a Sunday just after noon with my wife and two girls (age 14 and 12). Positives; many rides to fit the needs of our family! Smaller coaster was great for my younger girl who is somewhat nervous on rides. Mini-golf course was really fun. We drove the bumper",
          "Very nice park, we went on a weekday, so no coaster going, but all the other rides were operating and it was not busy at all. 4 courses of mini golf, awesome lay out, went on the bumper boats and also the go carts, lots of fun. Good value!",
          "We're on vacation in Phoenix and this place looked like a good bet for some fun. My wife challenged me to play a round of miniature golf with her and that is among the many attractions at this facility. Obviously, too, this place has a roller coaster along with several other",

          "We went on a Wednesday and were very disappointed all we could do was mini golf,bumper boats and go carts. The arcade was open as well. There was very little staff so you had to wait for the go carts to be done before anyone came to work the broken down bumper boats. There was",

          "We have been visiting this site for years. It It is a small park but the only one in Phoenix.There have been many improvements and the site has been refreshed the past year. We have had three Birthday parties there. They are a great value and all the kids end up wanting to",
          "This place has absolutely everything you can imagine and they are adjacent to a mall. The kids love the old school arcade games as well",
          "Maybe because I'm from California, I think all major cities are supposed to have amusement parks, but not in Phoenix. This is more of a mom pop small scale amusement park. Think permanent carnival. If you are a coaster fan like me, it's yawn worthy. But not a bad place to take",
          "Our family had a great time at the park. On Thanksgiving it is half price so it is a great value for the money. There is plenty to do and you don't have to pay if you just watch the activities. I don't do the rides but it was great fun watching my family enjoy them. We plan on",

          "There were 4 different courses to choose from. We chose course #3 which was fairly challenging! It was definitely well designed! We wanted to do the rope course but it was quite pricey, so we passed. There was a two-story arcade complete with all the \"vintage\" video games",

          "I lived in Peoria for about 10 years. This was our regular weekend hangout with the kids. They loved it, my wife and I always had a good time. Nice family spot, if you have a hankering for the Midway, this is where you have to be! Enjoy! \ud83d\ude09",
          "Very friendly staff, very clark facility. Lots of games old and new in the arcade, all reasonably priced. Only problem we ran into was on the mini golf course, on multiple holes the chutes the ball goes into to drop to the lower level were \u2026",
          "Definitely a 4.0. I would rank it higher, if they didn't charge water for 4 dollars. Quite a lovely place to spend with friends and family, especially for a birthday party. Bit too crowded but that means people love it. Favourite ride was \u2026",
          "We had so much fun. Be posting a video soon on YouTube. If you like to see it checked out our YouTube channel it's Chris & Olia!",
          "I loved this place up until today! Juan G made mine and my family\u2019s experience the worst! Very un profesional employee! Never coming back! No compassion towards the riders!!!",
          "Just good afternoon fun. I can't wait to get back in that arcade. I love all of the old school arcade systems they have.",
          "Castles N' Coasters is a Phoenix amusement park mainstay of cultural history. If you enjoy the Phoenix Fairgrounds, you can't disrespect the phenomenon that is Castles N' Coasters. They have updated their greens and keep their arcades \u2026",
          "The arcade games were AWESOME especially Halo, Big Hunt, House of the Dead, all 4 of Mortal Kombat and some Mario Kart game. Didn't get to ride the Coasters but did enjoyed the miniature golf course.",
          "I love coming here. Many mini golf courses to choose from and the rides are excellent. If your looking for a fun little roller coaster day and arcade without driving to the next state this would be a lovely stop. Also excellent for birthday parties for the little ones",
          "Enjoyed Playing Miniature Golf with my Teenagers. The Good  Maintenance and Upkeep on the Course Made our Weekday Visit More Enjoyable. \nFew Activities were Open on the Weekday Yet We Still Had a Great Time in the Arcade, the Go Carts, \u2026",
          "Mini golf is still really fun. Course isn't as well kept as it used to be so can't give it 5 stars but doesn't feel run down. Great time for the kiddos.",
          "It's really cool for my family, it brings joy and eximent to us! Also the staff there are really kind and generous person's! Thanks for being my families favorite place to be!",
          "Great family place! Always a fun time for young and old! Awesome childhood memories",
          "This place is a family oriented fun house with tons of exciting things to do.\nVery clean and well managed. All games were up to par and were in good working condition. Some of them were priced pretty high, but overall you get your money's \u2026",
          "This review is from a past experience I had here before they shutdown for covid19\n\nOverpriced and really old rides, I spent almost 120 dollars for my kids myself and my wife just to ride a couple of rides they had and they were constantly \u2026",
          "I really really like coming here, especially on weekdays when they have their $10 for 3 hours of arcade play deal. Just the other day, I did the whole park pass and enjoyed the two roller coasters, the boat swing, the log ride, bumper cars, \u2026",
          "Well let just say, my family and I where very excited to stop since we never been here. When arriving at the counter to pay , we had lots of questions and the cashier's helping us didn't seem to want to answer or care about it. All she said \u2026",
          "It was as always a blast. My son is not yet even 4 and was just tall enough to go on the desert storm and he loved every minute of it. We rode it all throughout the day and he still wants more.",
          "Staff are helpful and courteous. The park is a bit spendy for its size, but overall a nice day adventure. Be sure to add mini golf and 3-D movie to the cost of your initial ticket to save money.",
          "I think I'll get out of the heat for a while when it's really super hot though it's not so fun they do have people that walk around and spray you with water and have misting systems and fans. My kids really liked it in the mini golf it's \u2026",
          "A great little amusement park. One down fall was no handicap access. Or ramps for stroller's.",
          "Family fun! Only disappointing part was a couple rides were closed. They should have a discounted rate for those who go later in the evening.",
          "We had a great time here ND my son wants to really come back to play da mini golf again.....we both loved it \ud83d\udc95\u26f3",
          "Fun but would NOT recommend for a birthday party. They require a minimum of 10 wristbands at full price... $400. They claim that the \"one hour in the party room\" is free... However they charge for parents and adults to be in the party \u2026",
          "Always a great place to have fun with family and friends at an affordable price. 3 hour unlimited video games for $13. Would love it if they expended the park. Hope one day they do.",
          "Castle's and Coasters is really great! Fantastic amount of games to play, well taken care of pinball and classic arcade machines, that are fixed fairly quickly if they ever break down, and the addition of more and more new games. (Like beat \u2026",
          "Kind of pricey for what you get but the staff does a good job and my teenage kids had enjoyed it.",
          "Great family day!!!\nFirst I must say thanks to\nShamrock Farms \nFor buying out the place for employee family & friends ..\n\nWe had a great time -the lines do tend to be long - but -- we felt safe and the employees appeared knowledgeable..... \u2026",
          "Ok place for a birthday party but not much to do. 1 roller coaster that is medium size and 1 small coaster for toddlers. there is a spinning ride go karts bumper boats and a log ride that about sums this theme park up! They do also have \u2026",
          "I hadn't been here since I was a kid and was impressed with how well it has held up. The weekday arcade special is hard to beat!",
          "Fun place to go with kids. Quite a bit if it's good for the younger ones but they're still enough to keep the older ones happy. Only complaint at the moment is not their coasters are open during the weekdays right now and that's what my son wanted to do on his birthday.",
          "Lots of fun.  It was clean and wait times weren't terrible.  We love the arcade.  Our 11 yr old said she had the best birthday ever.  We upgraded our gold passes to annual passes so we could come back.",
          "Great family fun. A little bit of everything for everyone. My mom and dads company has an annual employee appreciation day here and we always have a blast. After MANY years, they are starting to update and repaint the place. It looks nice \u2026",
          "My family and I paid for the ride passes, mini golf, some arcades and the dark ride experience. I expected this place to be more run down considering it's age and the area but it was very well maintained and the rides were a blast. We were \u2026",
          "We had a great time. My son was tall enough for alot of the rides.",
          "We had a great time. There were a couple hickups to check in our group to the agreed package we signed up for but all was corrected & we had an amazing day. The staff did a great job keeping things clean and sterilizing the rides, tables, golf clubs, etc!!!",
          "My moms husbands work do family days here every year and they make it really special for us. I also see them pick up on things that didn\u2019t go so well the year prior and make a change. All the people who work the rides are always so funny \u2026",
          "The building is a little dated (well, it's a LOT dated), but they seem to keep all the old arcade games (and new ones) is pretty good working order.  Like a trip down memory lane playing those old pinball machines.",
          "Cool little spot, I've heard it been called \"ghetto\" but it's kind of quaint. It's nicer than some things from where i come from so people need to lighten up.",
          "It is one of the best places to go if your bored and you live in or Arizona, or even just visiting! So many fun rides and an arcade plus Mini Golf! And if you ever get hungry, you can always get a snack there either inside where the arcade is or outside and maybe enjoy a Slushie or soda!",
          "Fun little park with a decent roller coaster, log rides, gravity drop (I forgot the name), and an excellent mini-golf course (4-18 hole courses)! I would have given 5 stars but they really should get a good cleaning crew to wipe everything \u2026",
          "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE CASTLES N COASTERS!!!!!!!!\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa1\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99 And, on Tuesday, February 18th, 2020, I had my VERY FIRST JOB INTERVIEW with one of their AWESOME, LOTS of FUN, VERY KIND, and VERY ENERGETIC, ride supervisor, Mark, to try to get \u2026",
          "I'm rating this a 4 because they have some great old games I use to kick butt on but now...Galaxia returned the favor! Actually a very fun place with or without friends. Many things to do and have a great time. Ok I will say 5 for fun! Snacks too",
          "Great fun except I wish the arcade was like back in the old days when we had tokens.... Then the $13. Miniature golf is pretty pricey.",
          "Went on a school trip, I thought it was super fun. But the roller coasters were constantly closed and the food was so so. Except the funnel cakes, that was the best part",
          "I have lived in AZ my whole life and this is really the only amusement park we have. It gets 4 stars because every time we have gone the kids and I have had a great time. Love the golf courses, for how old the park is there overall \u2026",
          "I read some negative experiences so was a little apprehensive about taking my granddaughters 13, 5 and 3, but I had promised them. They had a blast! The people who work there were absolutely wonderful. We will be buying season tickets for this year.",
          "Amazing place for fun. Really loved the Rope walk...shooting Zombie show...Bumper cars and sea dragon....It's a must visit place for family and friends. We had a great time and I'll be there once again",

          "Always a fun time at Castles n Coasters.  The food isn't that great, but that's not why we go there anyways. It's nice to have a local little amusement park. The miniature golf course is a blast.  The video games are very cool, though they can get expensive fast.",
          "This theme park is all age-friendly. It comes with two roller coasters, one more kid-friendly than the other. All kind of rides: relaxing, fast, scary, kid-friendly, etc. I would say they have good variety of food there, but it's somewhat expensive. One can bring a bag with snacks fir yourself and your family when you're there\ud83c\udfa1",
          "4 different 18 Hole Putt Putt coarse. Had lots of fun. Lots to do besides golf too.",
          "A bit expensive for the size of the park. Definitely add mini golf and 3-D movie to the worst band price to save over 1/2 the cost of both. The snacks are really not worth mentioning. Over priced and not worth the cost, but that's on par \u2026",
          "Great amusement park for its size! We were able to spend hours here without getting bored. Even on Valentines Day night the lines weren't terrible, either. Granted theres only one REAL rollercoaster here, it's a great bang for your buck for all the other attractions they have, and they have mini golf, too.",
          "It's a great place for kids but there are some more intense rides for older thrill seekers too. Some of the staff are really friendly but be aware of what you pay for because most of them don't know (especially for the Platinum pass)",
          "LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE BRINGING MY FAMILY HERE! So many different rides, big to little, roller coasters, water rides, racing, zip line, fun house, mini golfing! It\u2019s like Disney Land, but less crowds, walking, and more bang for your buck!",
          "We love Castles n Coasters! There are some rides for my kids who are less adventurous and there are more exciting rides as well. My favorite is the Sea Dragon. We love the mini golf. The whole park is fun and the golf courses are beautifully decorated.",
          "We had so much fun during our visit!",
          "I had the time of my life with friends and we're all 25+ years old. Great time and short lines and the staff was out of this world friendly. Definitely will be coming back!!",
          "i love this place i went here for a birthday party and it was so fun. we went on this one ride 6 times because we loved it. definitely recommend",
          "This place is amazing. It is asmall parkwith minimal rides as well as an arcade which really helps during the summer time. Mini golf is very much worth it and such a great price.",
          "Overpriced, dirty, disorganized, joke run by a bunch of clueless teenagers. Showed up on a weeknight, with little to no guests, and the lazy teenagers running the rides were giving my kid the run around with made up rules as to why the \u2026",
          "I have been going here for almost 30 years and it is the only amusement park with Roller coasters all year round. It is much safer than it was when I was younger. I do recommend getting a promotional pass if you plan to go more than twice a year. The food is awful but the mall around it has plenty of good places to eat.",
          "My son Ryker and I love Castles & Coasters, from mini golf to pinball and video games, fun fun fun!",
          "Fun Place to take the Family! Lots of roller coasters! And they have bunging jumping. Yummy Funnel cakes! They have a lot of Arcade Games. Highly recommend this place.",
          "I had a blast here with my children. Golf, Go karts, Zipline, coaster rides. The food and desserts were good also. I wish it was more for my 2 and 4yr old to do. carousel ride is about all my babies could do. Height requirements are apply \u2026",
          "Outstanding place to visit if you don't live in Arizona. The price is very reasonable to get  in terms of the rides. Few nice restaurants waffles and ice cream the people they have are very friendly two young ladies. The grounds seemed clean and it was something for everybody to do",
          "We had a birthday party here and it\u2019s definitely not worth it! The pizza is the nastiest pizza in the world and they are individually priced at $6 for a mini pizza. They rush you through the limited hour that you have and they don't have \u2026",
          "Hasn't changed in 30 + years. Brings back old memories. Love this place!",
          "We had such a great time. Really enjoyed the putt putt. Has a nice arcade.",
          "This place has been around FOREVER.  I am very glad that it is still open and they have not shut it down.  You will find a very cool arcade when you go into this place.  They have a lot of older video games that will put your nostalgia into high gear.  All around it is a fun experience even though the place is quite old.",
          "5 stars but we didn't stay for the drama.",
          "I'm glad to see they have kept the park well maintained. Was great taking my kids where I went as a kid",
          "Castles N' Coasters is an amusement park and family amusement center located in Phoenix, Arizona. This place is very cool, and there's a lot of things and do to enjoy it. The place has rides for all ages. The value is excellent for what you get. There are lots of games. Your family will enjoy it. Have fun!",
          "You can get a wristband which is $35 and then you can ride all the rides free individual rides are between 5 and $9 a ride they have gas powered Indy cars gas powered bumper boats and a lot of fun rides, they have a jumbo hot dog and \u2026",
          "Spent close to 200$ just to come in to not even an amusement park but to be delayed by an outage of power.",
          "I had a really good time. I will be back.",
          "Not very many \"Coasters\", that being said however it was an amazing experience. The rides I went on were a blast, lines weren't that bad, food was above average, and overall the experiences made were ones I'll look on for a while! 9/10 would recommend to anyone daring to go on their first coaster.",
          "Great fun for all ages.  Lines are rarely long, and you can cool down on the log ride.",
          "We had our teen's birthday party here. It turned out to be a nice time. The decor is in need of an update but the teenage staff are friendly and attentive.",
          "This place is even more fun now than when i was a kid! So much to do. The 3D zombie shooting game/ride  is a great experience for $5 a person. The zipline was fun too! They have a giant claw machine too that's really good! It's expensive but good!",
          "You can do everything here in one day. That's not a knock at all. It is one fun filled day! Mini golf, arcade, bumper boats, bumper cars, go cars, rollercoaster, many other rides, Zipline... I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot. Have a blast!!",
          "Expensive but worth an all day pass. \nFor the unlimited pass it's $41 per person. There's only 2 coasters, one for the small kids and one simple one for older kids/ adults, but nothing like 6 flags. The other really fun rides are a swinging \u2026",
          "We had a great time! Especially playing old school video games Defender, Asteroids, Donkey Kong & Pacman. A trip down memory lane.",
          "Fun weekend with family. I'm glad we have at least this in Phx. It's not California style theme parks though. Maybe in the near future?",
          "Tons of fun things to do! Staff wasn't too friendly. Will be though!!",
          "Loved this place for the last 20 years\nIt\u2019s a fantastic place for a family! Or even a couple!",
          "several of their employees wanted to discriminate against my autistic son and niece. also a manager I first talked to said they couldn't adjust to the disability act.",
          "I took my family here for the first time this weekend. The arcades were a lot of fun. Our kids really have a good time. We will be coming back in the near future.",
          "The arcade is cool. The coasters are ok. The staff were great. I suppose the downside is that there really aren't that many attractions. We spent about 3 hours there. The arcade was really cool. The weird little house wasn't worth the money at all..",
          "Miniature golf was a blast. Have not played it in years! Great challenge courses of 18 holes!",
          "It's definitely fun! However it's expensive. I dropped $40 for four people in miniature golf. You could easily spend $100 in this place and that's too much. Fyi, the bathrooms don't get much attention, so beware. Lastly, the kids working there are mostly friendly except out front where it really counts.",
          "Fun place with fun rides for kids and adults! I've lived here all my life and never been on the rides! The staff was not the most friendly but otherwise it's a super fun place!",
          "Weekday Replay is great.  Lots of games, 95%+ were working.  C&C does good job keeping classic games working.",
          "Really cool amusement park with decent rides, it can get pretty busy at times",
          "Had alot of fun here. The rides are a little sketchy though .  they told us they got a call of it being unsafe to come back in 15 mins. Lol.. The rides are old but its still pretty fun",

          "Smells like feet every where from old carpet. Customer service is pretty poor, but it is ran by teens. Outside of that it is enjoyable, they have some fun stuff to do. It has a few thrill rides, tons of new and older arcade games (Older \u2026",

          "Expensive but fun little spot. Wish there were more arcades for young children. Don't like all the shoot them up games. Bumper boats were the kids favorite by far.",
          "Pretty decent actually, if you're lucky enough to go when it's relatively empty",
          "Been going to this place since I was only 5 years old.  I've always enjoyed it.  Can get slightly pricy.  But totally worth it!",
          "Price is a little steep but it's very well maintained. Wish the $25 retro Friday price was all day... Not just after 5pm.",
          "Being near Metro Center Mall I had a certain expectation about what Castles N' Coasters would be like and I am happy to say I couldn't have been more wrong. This place is a wonderful gem. \n\nThe staff were pleasant. The park was impeccably \u2026",
          "We had a lot of fun, wish the log ride seat belts.  . . It scared my daughter she's 7. I'm over 200 lbs and got air on the drops. Wish the web site explained the hours and what was actually available to ride. We did get great service from nice staff. Everyone was friendly. Loved the arcade pass. We will go again.",
          "4 nice putt putt options, lots of games, and go carts. Nice area to get away from your phones, and have some fun.",

          "My only complaint was that the day wasn\u2019t longer. Had a fantastic time taking my granddaughter here. The value is excellent for what you get. There are lots of games. The gold is premium and very high quality. \n\nThe rides are great. You can \u2026",
          "My grandson and I have been coming here to enjoy miniature golf for 15 years.  Always enjoyable time",
          "Went up there to meet the wifey and her fam bam. Couldn't find them for the longest. Customer service paged her. She ain't hear it.  Now that might seem frustrating however.... There was soooo many different types of people there... I had zero problemo people watching.... For my wife of course.",
          "The kids had a blast!  Lines were not long at all and this was in July! The place has rides for all ages. And for every level of bravery!  Spend the day and have fun!",
          "Always a fun place to go with my little sis! Didn't age that well and the workers seem like they hate their lives, but it's Arizona so at least it's something fun to do",
          "Great time, not very busy. Played mini golf and it was fun! Lots of various obstacles, no one hole is the same",
          "It\u2019s fun and prices are decent. I wouldn\u2019t go in the summer though, the seats are just too hot \ud83e\udd75 I learned my lesson the hard way \ud83d\ude02 just stay indoors in the summer.",
          "A PLACE WHERE INJURIES ARE WAITING TO HAPPEN< STAY AWAY!!!! \nWe went there for MLK day, as my kids always seeing it as we drive on the I-17, the rides always looked old and unappealing. Their friend asked them to go today, so I said I would \u2026",
          "Great fun for all ages!!! Inexpensive wrist bands. Cool rollercoaster and zip line as well as water rides, arcade, and mini golf! Fun!!!",
          "They do a nice job of keeping this place up. The Mini golf is a fun diversion come a however come up the crowd can be a little sketchy at night. It is a little unsettling that they have armed security guards there.",
          "Went there with my young child, which was a 45 min drive on a weekday at 345pm walked in and was told we had to leave due to a private party. Nothing was posted on the website or google, asked to speak with the manager in a totally polite \u2026",
          "Not bad. Lots of fun and not very crowded on a weekday evening. Good deals on blocks of game time. Tons of arcade games.",
          "Been coming back here since a kid, pleased to see a recent update to the arcade and is quite nice. \nThe golf course and other rides do seem to be on need of a overhaul though, not terrible but very worn cosmetics.",
          "The equipment is rusted and possibly a hazard. I highly suggest if you\u2019re going to take your children out to play it safe and go to Enchanted Island. They have safer rides that are just as enjoyable.",
          "Lotta holes. Great themes. Great fun for all ages. Would take my family there to shame again.",
          "Don\u2019t recommend , it isn\u2019t  crowded at all even if it was you wouldn\u2019t be there waiting in a line for 30 minutes. I saw a employee spraying guest with a water tank and on his back which look like a weed killer. Also the rides are so ruined \u2026",
          "Great adventurous place.My kids loved this place.we enjoyed alot.",
          "Place was fun but kinda run down. Rollercoaster were jerky, the merry-go-round round made a lot of grinding noises, a lot of the mini golf holes were broke and ate our balls. No new balls were given out. Ended up sharing.",
          "Was there for the Frys associates and family event. Family and I had a great time! We were pleasantly surprised to see that ALL of the rides were up and running\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Castles and coasters is legit! The arcade has air hockey and guitar hero which are my favorites. There is also mini golf and some rides that are a great attraction of the park also. I'm glad this place is open until midnight!",
          "Always a great time. The kids had fun and so did.",

          "It was fun and most of the staff were friendly and helpful. I did think for the size of amusement park , it's over priced for admission. Especially the food and drink prices. $3 for a bottle if water. Glad they are open late and offer mini golf and unlimited ride passes.",
          "This is a fun place for adults and kids. They have so much to offer everyone. Rides, mini putt putt golf, video games and a ropes course to. It's great to have party's but should call for info and reservations. It's a year round treat for sure. They do have a small snack bar. Wheelchair accessible parking and entrance.",

          "It's a great lil amusement park. We love the water ride during the summer.",
          "The Desert Storm Roller Coaster is the primary reason we went to Castles and Coasters. Sure wish they still had the cameras for a picture of your faces. As always, I wish the roller coaster ride lasted longer. Bumper boats were a good time. \u2026",

          "Good family place cost a little more than expected but good fun",
          "Fun but OMG it's still 100\u00b0 outside at 9 PM. Rides are pricey ....discounts should be given in the summer.... otherwise it just seems like a bum deal. Paying $8  for 1 ride or $12 for Mini golf just to sweat your bootie off and then be charged $3 for a bottle of water. \ud83e\udd14 Not again. The place is well kept and staff are friendly.",
          "Great place to take the familia.",
          "PROS: The mini golf is cute and has plenty of appeal for all ages, and same goes for the rides.  This Arizona theme park is definitely the next best thing to the California ones, lol. It's like the State Fair, but safer. And less drunk. \ud83d\ude02 \u2026",

          "I've been coming here since the 1970s when I lived in Phoenix, and we visit every time we come back to Arizona. By far the best minigolf place I've been to. The courses are well maintained and there are four good ones to choose from. The \u2026",

          "Facility is well maintained.  Good spot to spend the day with the kiddos.",
          "Just went here for the first time tonight with my family. We had a great time. I would say that it might not necessarily be worth it to buy a rides wristband for your child if they are under 44 inches. There were only about 5 rides my 3 \u2026",
          "Even 2 decades later I still enjoyed this place as an adult! Rollercoasters! Go karts! Games! Ziplines! And golf! So much fun!",
          "Went to castles n coasters for a birthday party. Kids of all ages had a great time. Gave 4 stars because some of the lines were long waits. But I can't fault the venue for being busy. Everyone had fun. Staff was helpful & friendly. Thank you",
          "A little run down. There's this catwalk kind of attraction that's been closed down past 2 times I've come. Those visits were months apart and you can see it's rusted and nothing done to it. The mini golf is fun. The games inside are cool. \u2026",
          "Nice little park with games and rides. The XD game room is a must, my family loved playing that game together.",
          "Had fun, but it needs some maintenance",

          "Had a good time but this spot is a little bit ghetto. Can't complain too much but you can tell these rides are getting pretty old. A little freaky sometimes but none broke down today so made it out alive!!! Everything is of course overpriced but you have to go in kind of expecting that....",
          "Ovet proved and not enough options. They only hsve the 3 wrist bands.  I cant believe they charge 50 bucks a person to just get in",

          "I went there for my school field trip in May. I ride every ride, except the Desert Storm. It is really fun.",
          "It was okay overall. The closest \"disney\" coaster park in phoenix, defintely not anywhere near other amusement parks. Much cheaper, under $50, compared to $150. Worth a try, but gets boring quickly. as it's a small park. Good time overall",

          "It's a great date spot\ud83d\ude02",

          "Came here for a date night to play some games and golf. This place has been around since I was a kid and I still enjoy coming here. In my opinion the value is worth the trip to Castles and Coasters. They have one of the best miniature golf \u2026",

          "This place has been around for what seems like forever and to a degree in some areas you can see it's age. Even so it is still a lot of fun for all ages. Between the golf, rides, and arcade, there is something for everyone to enjoy.",
          "Funny and fun for all age groups",
          "It's fun, the arcade is totally updated. But they need more rides. There's not enough variety in that category",

        "wiki": "Phoenix () is the capital and most populous city in Arizona, with 1,680,992 people (as of 2019). It is also the fifth most populous city in the United States along with being the largest state capital by population, and the only state capital with a population of more than one million residents.Phoenix is the anchor of the Phoenix metropolitan area, also known as the Valley of the Sun, which in turn is part of the Salt River Valley. The metropolitan area is the 11th largest by population in the United States, with approximately 4.73 million people as of 2017. Phoenix is the seat of Maricopa County and the largest city in the state at 517.9 square miles (1,341 km2), more than twice the size of Tucson and one of the largest cities in the United States.Phoenix was settled in 1867 as an agricultural community near the confluence of the Salt and Gila Rivers and was incorporated as a city in 1881. It became the capital of Arizona Territory in 1889. It is in the northeastern reaches of the Sonoran Desert and has a hot desert climate. Despite this, its canal system led to a thriving farming community with the original settler's crops remaining important parts of the Phoenix economy for decades, such as alfalfa, cotton, citrus, and hay. Cotton, cattle, citrus, climate, and copper were known locally as the \"Five C's\" anchoring Phoenix's economy. These remained the driving forces of the city until after World War II, when high-tech companies began to move into the valley and air conditioning made Phoenix's hot summers more bearable.The city averaged a four percent annual population growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s. This growth rate slowed during the Great Recession of 2007\u201309, and has rebounded slowly. Phoenix is the cultural center of the state of Arizona.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Hohokam people occupied the Phoenix area for 2,000 years. They created roughly 135 miles (217 kilometers) of irrigation canals, making the desert land arable, and paths of these canals were used for the Arizona Canal, Central Arizona Project Canal, and the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct. They also carried out extensive trade with the nearby Ancient Puebloans, Mogollon, and Sinagua, as well as with the more distant Mesoamerican civilizations. It is believed periods of drought and severe floods between 1300 and 1450 led to the Hohokam civilization's abandonment of the area.After the departure of the Hohokam, groups of Akimel O'odham (commonly known as Pima), Tohono O'odham, and Maricopa tribes began to use the area, as well as segments of the Yavapai and Apache. The O'odham were offshoots of the Sobaipuri tribe, who in turn were thought to be the descendants of the Hohokam.The Akimel O'odham were the major group in the area. They lived in small villages with well-defined irrigation systems that spread over the Gila River Valley, from Florence in the east to the Estrellas in the west. Their crops included corn, beans, and squash for food as well as cotton and tobacco. They banded with the Maricopa for protection against incursions by the Yuma and Apache tribes. The Maricopa are part of the larger Yuma people; however, they migrated east from the lower Colorado and Gila Rivers in the early 1800s, when they began to be enemies with other Yuma tribes, settling among the existing communities of the Akimel O'odham.The Tohono O'odham also lived in the region, but largely to the south and all the way to the Mexican border. The O'odham lived in small settlements as seasonal farmers who took advantage of the rains, rather than the large-scale irrigation of the Akimel. They grew crops such as sweet corn, tapery beans, squash, lentils, sugar cane, and melons, as well as taking advantage of native plants such as saguaro fruits, cholla buds, mesquite tree beans, and mesquite candy (sap from the mesquite tree). They also hunted local game such as deer, rabbit, and javelina for meat.The Mexican\u2013American War ended in 1848, Mexico ceded its northern zone to the United States, and the region's residents became U.S. citizens. The Phoenix area became part of the New Mexico Territory. In 1863, the mining town of Wickenburg was the first to be established in Maricopa County, to the northwest of Phoenix. Maricopa County had not been incorporated; the land was within Yavapai County, which included the major town of Prescott to the north of Wickenburg.\nThe Army created Fort McDowell on the Verde River in 1865 to forestall Indian uprisings. The fort established a camp on the south side of the Salt River by 1866, which was the first settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam. Other nearby settlements later merged to become the city of Tempe.\n\n\n=== Founding and incorporation ===\n\nThe history of the city of Phoenix begins with Jack Swilling, a Confederate veteran of the Civil War. He was traveling through the Salt River Valley in 1867 and saw a potential for farming. He formed a small community that same year about four miles (six km) east of the city. Lord Darrell Duppa was one of the original settlers in Swilling's party, and he suggested the name \"Phoenix\", as it described a city born from the ruins of a former civilization.The Board of Supervisors in Yavapai County officially recognized the new town on May 4, 1868, and the first post office was established the following month with Swilling as the postmaster. On February 12, 1871, the territorial legislature created Maricopa County by dividing Yavapai County; it was the sixth one formed in the Arizona Territory. The first election for county office was held in 1871 when Tom Barnum was elected the first sheriff. He ran unopposed when the other two candidates (John A. Chenowth and Jim Favorite) fought a duel; Chenowth killed Favorite and was forced to withdraw from the race.The town grew during the 1870s, and President Ulysses S. Grant issued a land patent for the site of Phoenix on April 10, 1874. By 1875, the town had a telegraph office, 16 saloons, and four dance halls, but the townsite-commissioner form of government needed an overhaul. An election was held in 1875, and three village trustees and other officials were elected. By 1880, the town's population stood at 2,453.\n\nBy 1881, Phoenix's continued growth made the board of trustees obsolete. The Territorial Legislature passed the Phoenix Charter Bill, incorporating Phoenix and providing a mayor-council government; Governor John C. Fremont signed the bill on February 25, 1881, officially incorporating Phoenix as a city with a population of around 2,500.The railroad's arrival in the valley in the 1880s was the first of several events that made Phoenix a trade center whose products reached eastern and western markets. In response, the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce was organized on November 4, 1888. The city offices moved into the new City Hall at Washington and Central in 1888. The territorial capital was moved from Prescott to Phoenix in 1889, and the territorial offices were also in City Hall. With the arrival of the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railroad in 1895, Phoenix was connected to Prescott, Flagstaff, and other communities in the northern part of the territory. The increased access to commerce expedited the city's economic rise. The Phoenix Union High School was established in 1895 with an enrollment of 90.\n\n\n=== 1900 to World War II ===\n\nOn February 25, 1901, Governor Oakes Murphy dedicated the permanent Capitol building, and the Carnegie Free Library opened seven years later, on February 18, 1908, dedicated by Benjamin Fowler. The National Reclamation Act was signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, which allowed for dams to be built on waterways in the west for reclamation purposes. The first dam constructed under the act, Salt River Dam#1, began in 1903. It supplied both water and electricity, becoming the first multi-purpose dam, and Roosevelt himself attended the official dedication on May 18, 1911. At the time, it was the largest masonry dam in the world, forming a lake in the mountain east of Phoenix. The dam would be renamed after Teddy Roosevelt in 1917, and the lake would follow suit in 1959.On February 14, 1912, Phoenix became a state capital, as Arizona was admitted to the Union as the 48th state under President William Howard Taft. This occurred just six months after Taft had vetoed a joint congressional resolution granting statehood to Arizona, due to his disapproval of the state constitution's position regarding the recall of judges. In 1913, Phoenix's move from a mayor-council system to council-manager made it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government. After statehood, Phoenix's growth started to accelerate, and eight years later, its population had reached 29,053. In 1920, Phoenix would see its first skyscraper, the Heard Building. In 1929, Sky Harbor was officially opened, at the time owned by Scenic Airways. It would later be purchased in 1935 by the city, which operates it today.\n\nOn March 4, 1930, former U.S. President Calvin Coolidge dedicated a dam on the Gila River named in his honor. However, the state had just been through a long drought, and the reservoir which was supposed to be behind the dam was virtually dry. The humorist Will Rogers, who was on hand as a guest speaker joked, \"If that was my lake, I'd mow it.\" Phoenix's population had more than doubled during the 1920s, and now stood at 48,118. It was also during the 1930s that Phoenix and its surrounding area began to be called \"The Valley of the Sun\", which was an advertising slogan invented to boost tourism.During World War II, Phoenix's economy shifted to that of a distribution center, transforming into an \"embryonic industrial city\" with the mass production of military supplies. There were three air force fields in the area: Luke Field, Williams Field, and Falcon Field, as well as two large pilot training camps, Thunderbird Field No. 1 in Glendale and Thunderbird Field No. 2 in Scottsdale.\n\n\n=== Post-World War II explosive growth ===\nA town that had just over 65,000 residents in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, with a population of nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix as the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas also moved into the valley and opened manufacturing operations.By 1950, over 105,000 people resided in the city and thousands more in surrounding communities. The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in air conditioning, which allowed both homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat experienced in Phoenix and the surrounding areas during its long summers. There was more new construction in Phoenix in 1959 alone than from 1914 to 1946.Like many emerging American cities at the time, Phoenix's spectacular growth did not occur evenly. It largely took place on the city's north side, a region that was nearly all Caucasian. In 1962, one local activist testified at a US Commission on Civil Rights hearing that of 31,000 homes that had recently sprung up in this neighborhood, not a single one had been sold to an African-American. Phoenix's African-American and Mexican-American communities remained largely sequestered on the south side of town. The color lines were so rigid that no one north of Van Buren Street would rent to the African-American baseball star Willie Mays, in town for spring training in the 1960s. In 1964, a reporter from The New Republic wrote of segregation in these terms: \"Apartheid is complete. The two cities look at each other across a golf course.\"\n\n\n=== 1960s to present ===\n\nThe continued rapid population growth led more businesses to the valley to take advantage of the labor pool, and manufacturing, particularly in the electronics sector, continued to grow. The convention and tourism industries saw rapid expansion during the 1960s, with tourism becoming the third largest industry by the end of the decade. In 1960 the Phoenix Corporate Center opened; at the time it was the tallest building in Arizona, topping off at 341 feet. The 1960s saw many other buildings constructed as the city expanded rapidly, including the Rosenzweig Center (1964), today called Phoenix City Square, the landmark Phoenix Financial Center (1964), as well as many of Phoenix's residential high-rises. In 1965 the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum opened at the Arizona State Fairgrounds, west of downtown. When Phoenix was awarded an NBA franchise in 1968, which would be called the Phoenix Suns, they played their home games at the Coliseum until 1992, after which they moved to America West Arena. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson approved the Central Arizona Project, assuring future water supplies for Phoenix, Tucson, and the agricultural corridor in between them. The following year, Pope Paul VI created the Diocese of Phoenix on December 2, by splitting the Archdiocese of Tucson, with Edward A. McCarthy as the first Bishop.In the 1970s the downtown area experienced a resurgence, with a level of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. The nine original villages  have expanded to 15 over the years (see Cityscape below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. The Phoenix Symphony Hall opened in 1972; other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the First National Bank Plaza, the Valley Center (the tallest building in the state of Arizona), and the Arizona Bank building.\nOn September 25, 1981, Phoenix resident Sandra Day O'Connor broke the gender barrier on the U.S. Supreme Court, when she was sworn in as the first female justice. In 1985, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, the nation's largest nuclear power plant, began electrical production. Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa both visited the Valley in 1987.There was an influx of refugees due to low-cost housing in the Sunnyslope area in the 1990s, resulting in 43 different languages being spoken in local schools by the year 2000. The new 20-story City Hall opened in 1992.Phoenix has maintained a growth streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed only by Las Vegas. In 2008, Squaw Peak, the city's second tallest mountain, was renamed Piestewa Peak after Army Specialist Lori Ann Piestewa, an Arizonan and the first Native American woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military, as well as being the first American female casualty of the 2003 Iraq War. 2008 also saw Phoenix as one of the cities hardest hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, and by early 2009 the median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in 2007. Crime rates in Phoenix have fallen in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain, Alhambra, and Maryvale have recovered and stabilized. Recently, downtown Phoenix and the central core have experienced renewed interest and growth, resulting in many restaurants, stores, and businesses opening or relocating to central Phoenix.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPhoenix is in the southwestern United States, in the south-central portion of Arizona; about halfway between Tucson to the southeast and Flagstaff to the north. By car, the city is approximately 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of the US-Mexico border at Sonoyta and 180 mi (290 km) north of the border at Nogales. The metropolitan area is known as the \"Valley of the Sun\" due to its location in the Salt River Valley. It lies at a mean elevation of 1,086 feet (331 m), in the northern reaches of the Sonoran Desert.Other than the mountains in and around the city, Phoenix's topography is generally flat, which allows the city's main streets to run on a precise grid with wide, open-spaced roadways. Scattered, low mountain ranges surround the valley: McDowell Mountains to the northeast, the White Tank Mountains to the west, the Superstition Mountains far to the east, and both South Mountain and the Sierra Estrella to the south/southwest. Camelback Mountain, North Mountain, Sunnyslope Mountain, and Piestewa Peak are within the heart of the valley. The city's outskirts have large fields of irrigated cropland and Native American reservation lands. The Salt River runs westward through Phoenix, but the riverbed is often dry or contains little water due to large irrigation diversions. South Mountain separates the community of Ahwatukee from the rest of the city.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 517.9 square miles (1,341 km2). 516.7 square miles (1,338 km2) of it is land, and 1.2 square miles (0.6 km2, or 0.2%) of it is water.\nMaricopa County grew by 811% from 186,000 in 1940 to 1,509,000 by 1980, thanks in part to air conditioning, cheap housing, and an influx of retirees. The once \"modest urban sprawl\" now \"grew by 'epic' proportions\u2014 not only a myriad of residential tract developments on both farmland and desert.\" Retail outlets and office complexes spread out and did not concentrate in the small downtown area. There was low population density and a lack of widespread and significant high-rise development. As a consequence Phoenix became a textbook case of urban sprawl for geographers. Even though it is the fifth most populated city, the large area gives it a low density rate of approximately 2,797 people per square mile. In comparison, Philadelphia, the sixth most populous city, has a density of over 11,000.Like most of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe daylight saving time. In 1973, Governor Jack Williams argued to the U.S. Congress that due to air conditioning units not being used as often in the morning on standard time, energy use would increase in the evening should the state observe daylight saving time. He went on to say energy use would also rise early in the day \"because there would be more lights on in the early morning.\" Additionally, he said daylight saving time would cause children to go to school in the dark.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n==== Neighborhoods ====\n\nSince 1979, the city of Phoenix has been divided into urban villages, many of which are based upon historically significant neighborhoods and communities that have since been annexed into Phoenix. Each village has a planning committee appointed directly by the city council. According to the city-issued village planning handbook, the purpose of the village planning committees is to \"work with the city's planning commission to ensure a balance of housing and employment in each village, concentrate development at identified village cores, and to promote the unique character and identity of the villages.\" There are 15 urban villages: Ahwatukee Foothills, Alhambra, Camelback East, Central City, Deer Valley, Desert View, Encanto, Estrella, Laveen, Maryvale, North Gateway, North Mountain, Paradise Valley, Rio Vista, and South Mountain.\nThe urban village of Paradise Valley is distinct from the nearby Town of Paradise Valley. Although the urban village is part of Phoenix, the town is independent.\nIn addition to the above urban villages, Phoenix has a variety of commonly referred-to regions and districts, such as Downtown, Midtown, Uptown, West Phoenix, North Phoenix, South Phoenix, Biltmore Area, Arcadia, and Sunnyslope.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPhoenix has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen: BWh), typical of the Sonoran Desert and is the largest city of America in this climatic zone. Phoenix has very hot summers and mild winters. The city is within one of the world's sunniest regions, with its sunshine duration comparable to the Sahara region. With 3,872 hours of bright sunshine annually, Phoenix receives the most sunshine of any major city on Earth. Average high temperatures in summer are the hottest of any major city in the United States. On average, there are 107 days annually with a high of at least 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) including most days from late May through early October. Highs top 110 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C) an average of 18 days during the year. On June 26, 1990, the temperature reached an all-time recorded high of 122 \u00b0F (50 \u00b0C).Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, was ranked 7th for most ozone pollution in the United States according to the American Lung Association. Ozone forms in sunlight, so Phoenix is particularly susceptible to ozone formation. Vehicle emissions are cited as precursors to ozone formation. Phoenix also has high levels of particulate pollution, although cities in California lead the nation in this hazard. PM2.5 particlulate matter, which is a component of diesel engine exhaust, and larger PM10 particles, which can come from dust, can both reach concerning levels in Phoenix.Unlike most desert locations which have drastic fluctuations between day and nighttime temperatures, the urban heat island effect limits Phoenix's diurnal temperature variation. As the city has expanded, average summer low temperatures have been steadily rising. Pavement, sidewalks, and buildings store the sun's heat and radiate it at night. The daily normal low remains at or above 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C) for an average of 67 days per summer. On July 15, 2003, Phoenix set its record for the warmest daily low temperature, at 96 \u00b0F (36 \u00b0C).\n\nThe city averages approximately 300 days of sunshine, or over 85% of daylight hours, per year, and receives scant rainfall\u2014the average annual total at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is 8.03 in (204 mm). Precipitation is sparse during most of the year, but the North American Monsoon brings an influx of moisture each summer. Historically, the monsoon officially started when the average dew point was 55 \u00b0F (13 \u00b0C) for three days in a row\u2014typically occurring in early July. In order to increase monsoon awareness and promote safety, however, the National Weather Service decreed that starting in 2008, June 15 would be the official \"first day\" of the monsoon, and it would end on September 30. When active, the monsoon raises humidity levels and can cause heavy localized precipitation, flash floods, hail, destructive winds, and dust storms\u2014which can rise to the level of a haboob in some years.July is the wettest month (1.05 in (27 mm)), while June is the driest (0.02 in (0.51 mm)). On September 8, 2014, the city of Phoenix recorded its single highest rainfall total by the National Weather Service with 3.30 in (84 mm) breaking the 75-year-old record of 2.91 in (74 mm), set on September 4, 1939. The September 2014 storm was created from the remnants of Hurricane Norbert which had moved up from the Gulf of California and flooded the city's major interstates and low-lying roadways, stranding hundreds of motorists. On average, dew points range from 31 \u00b0F (\u22121 \u00b0C) in December to 58 \u00b0F (14 \u00b0C) in August. Occasionally, dew points can rise to 76 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C) or higher during periods of strong monsoon activity \u2013 creating especially muggy conditions in the area.Generally speaking, the annual minimum temperature in Phoenix is in the mid-to-low 30s. It rarely drops to 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) or below, having done so in only seven of the years between 1995\u20142015 on a total of sixteen days. However, peripheral portions of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area frequently see frost in the winter. The earliest freeze on record occurred on November 4, 1956, and the latest occurred on March 31, 1987.  The all-time lowest recorded temperature in Phoenix was 16 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C) on January 7, 1913, while the coldest daily high temperature ever recorded was 36 \u00b0F (2 \u00b0C) on December 10, 1898. The longest continuous stretch without a day of frost in Phoenix was over 5 years, from November 23, 1979, to January 31, 1985.Snow is a rare occurrence in Phoenix. Snowfall was first officially recorded in 1898, and since then, accumulations of 0.1 inches (0.25 cm) or greater have occurred only eight times. The heaviest snowstorm on record took place on January 21\u201322, 1937, when 1 to 4 inches (2.5 to 10.2 cm) fell in parts of the city and did not melt entirely for three days. On December 6, 1998, snow fell across the northwest portions of the city, and Sky Harbor reported a dusting of snow. On December 30, 2010, and February 20, 2013, graupel fell across much of the city, although it was widely believed to be snow. Most recently, on February 21\u201322, 2019, the far northern and northeastern sections of the metro area were blanketed with several inches of snow while Sky Harbor received record rainfall.\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\nWhile some of the native flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert can be found within Phoenix city limits, most are found in the suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas that surround the city. Native mammal species include coyote, javelina, bobcat, mountain lion, desert cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, antelope ground squirrel, mule deer, ringtail, coati, and multiple species of bats, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and western pipistrelle, that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including Costa's hummingbird, Anna's hummingbird, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, mourning dove, white-winged dove, the roadrunner, the cactus wren, and many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such as the turkey vulture and black vulture), and eagles, including the golden and the bald eagle.The greater Phoenix region is home to the only thriving feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This bird is a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree fronds.The area is also home to a plethora of native reptile species including the Western diamondback rattlesnake, Sonoran sidewinder, several other types of rattlesnakes, Sonoran coral snake, dozens of species of non-venomous snakes (including the Sonoran gopher snake and the California kingsnake), the gila monster, desert spiny lizard, several types of whiptail lizards, the chuckwalla, desert horned lizard, western banded gecko, Sonora mud turtle, and the desert tortoise. Native amphibian species include the Couch's spadefoot toad, Chiricahua leopard frog, and the Sonoran desert toad.Phoenix and the surrounding areas are also home to a wide variety of native invertebrates including the Arizona bark scorpion, giant desert hairy scorpion, Arizona blond tarantula, Sonoran Desert centipede, tarantula hawk wasp, camel spider, and tailless whip scorpion. Of great concern is the presence of Africanized bees which can be extremely dangerous\u2014even lethal\u2014when provoked.\nThe Arizona Upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert (of which Phoenix is a part) has \"the most structurally diverse flora in the United States.\" One of the most well-known types of succulents, the giant saguaro cactus, is found throughout the city and its neighboring environs. Other native species are the organpipe, barrel, fishhook, senita, prickly pear and cholla cacti; ocotillo; Palo Verde trees and foothill and blue paloverde; California fan palm; agaves; soaptree yucca, Spanish bayonet, desert spoon, and red yucca; ironwood; mesquite; and the creosote bush.Many non-native plants also thrive in Phoenix including, but not limited to, the date palm, Mexican fan palm, pineapple palm, Afghan pine, Canary Island pine, Mexican fencepost cactus, cardon cactus, acacia, eucalyptus, aloe, bougainvillea, oleander, lantana, bottlebrush, olive, citrus, and red bird of paradise.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPhoenix is the sixth most populous city in the United States according to the 2010 United States Census, with a population of 1,445,632, making it the most populous state capital in the United States. Phoenix's ranking as the sixth most populous city was a drop from the number five position it had held since the U. S. Census Bureau released population estimates on June 28, 2007. Those statistics used data from 2006, which showed Phoenix's population at 1,512,986, which put it just ahead of Philadelphia. In 2016, Phoenix regained the position of 5th most populous city, with the census bureau estimating its population at 1,615,017, edging out Philadelphia with a population of 1,567,872.After leading the U.S. in population growth for over a decade, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, followed by the recession, led to a slowing in the growth of Phoenix. There were approximately 77,000 people added to the population of the Phoenix metropolitan area in 2009, which was down significantly from its peak in 2006 of 162,000. Despite this slowing, Phoenix's population grew by 9.4% since the 2000 census (a total of 124,000 people), while the entire Phoenix metropolitan area grew by 28.9% during the same period. This compares with an overall growth rate nationally during the same time frame of 9.7%. Not since 1940\u201350, when the city had a population of 107,000, had the city gained less than 124,000 in a decade. Phoenix's recent growth rate of 9.4% from the 2010 census is the first time it has recorded a growth rate under 24% in a census decade. However, in 2016, Phoenix once again became the fastest growing city in the United States, adding approximately 88 people per day during the preceding year.The Phoenix Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (officially known as the Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler MSA ), is one of 10 MSAs in Arizona, and was the 11th largest in the United States, with a 2018 U.S. Census population estimate of 4,857,962, up from the 2010 Census population of 4,192,887. Consisting of both Pinal and Maricopa counties, the MSA accounts for 65.5% of Arizona's population. Phoenix only contributed 13% to the total growth rate of the MSA, down significantly from its 33% share during the prior decade. Phoenix is also part of the Arizona Sun Corridor megaregion (MR), which is the 10th most populous of the 11 MRs, and the 8th largest by area. It had the 2nd largest growth by percentage of the MRs (behind only the Gulf Coast MR) between 2000 and 2010.\n\nThe population is almost equally split between men and women, with men making up 50.2% of city's citizens. The population density is 2,797.8 people per square mile, and the city's median age is 32.2 years, with only 10.9 of the population being over 62. 98.5% of Phoenix's population lives in households with an average household size of 2.77 people.\nThere were 514,806 total households, with 64.2% of those households consisting of families: 42.3% married couples, 7% with an unmarried male as head of household, and 14.9% with an unmarried female as head of household. 33.6% of those households have children below the age of 18. Of the 35.8% of non-family households, 27.1% have a householder living alone, almost evenly split between men and women, with women having 13.7% and men occupying 13.5%.\nPhoenix has 590,149 housing units, with an occupancy rate of 87.2%. The largest segment of vacancies is in the rental market, where the vacancy rate is 14.9%, and 51% of all vacancies are in rentals. Vacant houses for sale only make up 17.7% of the vacancies, with the rest being split among vacation properties and other various reasons.The city's median household income was $47,866, and the median family income was $54,804. Males had a median income of $32,820 versus $27,466 for females. The city's per capita income was $24,110. 21.8% of the population and 17.1% of families were below the poverty line. Of the total population, 31.4% of those under the age of 18 and 10.5% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.According to the 2010 Census, the racial breakdown of Phoenix was as follows:\n\nWhite: 65.9% (46.5% non-Hispanic)\nBlack or African American: 6.5% (6.0% non-Hispanic)\nNative American: 2.2%\nAsian: 3.2% (0.8% Indian, 0.5% Filipino, 0.5% Korean, 0.4% Chinese, 0.4% Vietnamese, 0.2% Japanese, 0.2% Thai, 0.1% Burmese)\nNative Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander: 0.2%\nOther race: 18.5%\nTwo or more races: 3.6%\nPhoenix's population has historically been predominantly white. From 1890 to 1970, over 90% of the citizens were white. In recent years, this percentage has dropped, reaching 65% In 2010. However, a large part of this decrease can be attributed to new guidelines put out by the U.S. Census Bureau in 1980, when a question regarding Hispanic origin was added to the census questionnaire. This has led to an increasing tendency for some groups to no longer self-identify as white, and instead categorize themselves as \"other races\".20.6% of the population of the city was foreign born in 2010. Of the 1,342,803 residents over 5 years of age, 63.5% spoke only English, 30.6% spoke Spanish at home, 2.5% spoke another Indo-European language, 2.1% spoke Asian or Islander languages, with the remaining 1.4% speaking other languages. About 15.7% of non-English speakers reported speaking English less than \"very well\". The largest national ancestries reported were Mexican (35.9%), German (15.3%), Irish (10.3%), English (9.4%), Black (6.5%), Italian (4.5%), French (2.7%), Polish (2.5%), American Indian (2.2%), and Scottish (2.0%).Hispanics or Latinos of any race make up 40.8% of the population. Of these the largest groups are at 35.9% Mexican, 0.6% Puerto Rican, 0.5% Guatemalan, 0.3% Salvadoran, 0.3% Cuban.\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 66% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, while 26% claimed no religious affiliation. The same study says other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 7% of the population. In 2010, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives, which conducts religious census each ten years, 39% of those polled in Maricopa county considered themselves a member of a religious group. Of those who expressed a religious affiliation, the area's religious composition was reported as 35% Catholic, 22% to Evangelical Protestant denominations, 16% Latter-Day Saints (LDS), 14% to nondenominational congregations, 7% to Mainline Protestant denominations, and 2% Hindu. The remaining 4% belong to other religions, such as Buddhism and Judaism.\nWhile the number of religious adherents increased by 103,000 during the decade, the growth did not keep pace with the county's overall population increase of almost three-quarters of million individuals during the same period. The largest aggregate increases were in the LDS (a 58% increase) and Evangelical Protestant churches (14% increase), while all other categories saw their numbers drop slightly or remain static. The Catholic Church had an 8% drop, while mainline Protestant groups saw a 28% decline.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe early economy of Phoenix focused on agriculture and natural resources, especially the \"5Cs\" of copper, cattle, climate, cotton, and citrus. With the establishment of the Southern Pacific rail line in 1926, the opening of the Union Station in 1923, and the creation of Sky Harbor airport by the end of the decade, the city became more easily accessible. The Great Depression affected Phoenix, but Phoenix had a diverse economy and by 1934 the recovery was underway. At the conclusion of World War II, the valley's economy surged, as many men who had completed their military training at the bases in and around Phoenix returned with their families. The construction industry, spurred on by the city's growth, further expanded with the development of Sun City. It became the template for suburban development in post-WWII America, and Sun City became the template for retirement communities when it opened in 1960. The city averaged a 4 percent annual growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s.As the national financial crisis of 2007\u201310 began, construction in Phoenix collapsed and housing prices plunged. Arizona jobs declined by 11.8% from peak to trough; in 2007 Phoenix had 1,918,100 employed individuals, by 2010 that number had shrunk by 226,500 to 1,691,600. By the end of 2015, the employment number in Phoenix had risen to 1.97 million, finally regaining its pre-recession levels, with job growth occurring across the board.As of 2017, the Phoenix MSA had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of just under $243 billion. The top five industries were: real estate ($41.96), Finance and insurance ($19.71), manufacturing ($19.91), Retail trade ($18.64), and health care ($19.78). Government (including federal, state and local), if it had been a private industry, would have been ranked second on the list, generating $23.37 billion.In Phoenix, real estate developers face few constraints when planning and developing new projects. Accordingly, the city is prone to overbuilding during times of economic prosperity. This explains the city's higher-than-average vacancy rates.\n\nAs of 2010, the top five employment categories were office and administrative support (17.8%), sales (11.6%), food preparation and serving (9%), transportation and material moving (6.1%), and management (5.8%). The single largest occupation is retail salespersons, which account for 3.7% of the workforce. As of January 2016, 10.5% of the workforce were government employees, a high number because the city is both the county seat and state capital. The civilian labor force was 2,200,900, and the unemployment rate stood at 4.6%.Phoenix is home to four Fortune 500 companies: electronics corporation Avnet, mining company Freeport-McMoRan, retailer PetSmart, and waste hauler Republic Services. Honeywell's Aerospace division is headquartered in Phoenix, and the valley hosts many of their avionics and mechanical facilities. Intel has one of their largest sites in the area, employing about 12,000 employees, the second largest Intel location in the country. The city is also home to the headquarters of U-HAUL International, Best Western, and Apollo Group, parent of the University of Phoenix. US Air/American Airlines is the largest carrier at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport. Mesa Air Group, a regional airline group, is headquartered in Phoenix.The military has a large presence in Phoenix, with Luke Air Force Base in the western suburbs. The city was severely impacted by the effects of the\nsub-prime mortgage crash. However, Phoenix has recovered 83% of the jobs lost\ndue to the recession.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nThe city has numerous performing arts venues, most of which are in and around downtown Phoenix or Scottsdale. The Phoenix Symphony Hall is home to the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra, the Arizona Opera and Ballet Arizona. The Arizona Opera company also has intimate performances at its new Arizona Opera Center, which opened in March 2013. Another venue is the Orpheum Theatre, which is home to the Phoenix Opera. Ballet Arizona, in addition to the Symphony Hall, also has performances at the Orpheum Theatre as well at the Dorrance Theater. Concerts also regularly make stops in the area. The largest downtown performing art venue is the Herberger Theater Center, which houses three performance spaces and is home to two resident companies, the Arizona Theatre Company and the Centre Dance Ensemble. Three other groups also use the facility: Valley Youth Theatre, iTheatre Collaborative and Actors Theater.Concerts can be attended at Talking Stick Resort Arena and Comerica Theatre in downtown Phoenix, Ak-Chin Pavilion in Maryvale, Gila River Arena in Glendale, and Gammage Auditorium in Tempe (the last public building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright). Several smaller theaters including Trunk Space, the Mesa Arts Center, the Crescent Ballroom, Celebrity Theatre, and Modified Arts support regular independent musical and theater performances. Music can also be seen in some of the venues usually reserved for sports, such as the Wells Fargo Arena and State Farm Stadium.Several television series have been set in Phoenix, including Alice (1976\u201385), the 2000s paranormal drama Medium, the 1960\u201361 syndicated crime drama The Brothers Brannagan, and The New Dick Van Dyke Show from 1971 to 1974.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nDozens of museums exist throughout the valley. They include the Phoenix Art Museum, Arizona Capitol Museum, Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, Arizona Military Museum, Hall of Flame Firefighting Museum, the Pueblo Grande Museum Archaeological Park, Children's Museum of Phoenix, Arizona Science Center, and the Heard Museum. In 2010, the Musical Instrument Museum opened their doors, featuring the biggest musical instrument collection in the world. In 2015 the Children's Museum of Phoenix was recognized as one of the top three children's museums in the United States.Designed by Alden B. Dow, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the Phoenix Art Museum was constructed in a single year, opening in November 1959. The Phoenix Art Museum has the southwest's largest collection of visual art, containing more than 17,000 works of contemporary and modern art from around the world. Interactive exhibits can be found in nearby Peoria's Challenger Space Center, where individuals learn about space, renewable energies, and meet astronauts.The Heard Museum has over 130,000 square feet (12,000 m\u00b2) of gallery, classroom and performance space. Some of the museum's signature exhibits include a full Navajo hogan, the Mareen Allen Nichols Collection of 260 pieces of contemporary jewelry, the Barry Goldwater Collection of 437 historic Hopi kachina dolls, and an exhibit on the 19th-century boarding school experiences of Native Americans. The Heard Museum attracts about 250,000 visitors a year.\n\n\n=== Fine arts ===\nThe downtown Phoenix art scene has developed in the past decade. The Artlink organization and the galleries downtown have launched a First Friday cross-Phoenix gallery opening, as well as hosting Art Detour which has become central to the city's cultural identity. In April 2009, artist Janet Echelman inaugurated her monumental sculpture, Her Secret Is Patience, a civic icon suspended above the new Phoenix Civic Space Park, a two-city-block park in the middle of downtown. This netted sculpture makes the invisible patterns of desert wind visible to the human eye. During the day, the 100-foot (30 m)-tall sculpture hovers high above heads, treetops, and buildings, the sculpture creates what the artist calls \"shadow drawings\", which she says are inspired by Phoenix's cloud shadows. At night, the illumination changes color gradually through the seasons. Author Prof. Patrick Frank writes of the sculpture that \"... most Arizonans look on the work with pride: this unique visual delight will forever mark the city of Phoenix just as the Eiffel Tower marks Paris.\"\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nPhoenix is the home of a unique architectural tradition and community. Frank Lloyd Wright moved to Phoenix in 1937 and built his winter home, Taliesin West, and the main campus for The Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture. Over the years, Phoenix has attracted notable architects who have made it their home and grown successful practices. These architectural studios embrace the desert climate, and are unconventional in their approach to the practice of design. They include the Paolo Soleri (who created Arcosanti), Al Beadle, Will Bruder, Wendell Burnette, and Blank Studio architectural design studios. Another major force in architectural landscape of the city was Ralph Haver whose firm, Haver & Nunn, designed commercial, industrial and residential structures throughout the valley. Of particular note was his trademark, \"Haver Home\", which were affordable contemporary-style tract houses.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nThe tourist industry is the longest running of today's top industries in Phoenix. Starting with promotions back in the 1920s, the industry has grown into one of the top 10 in the city. Due to its climate, Phoenix and its neighbors have consistently ranked among the nation's top destinations in the number of Five Diamond/Five Star resorts. With more than 62,000 hotel rooms in over 500 hotels and 40 resorts, greater Phoenix sees over 16 million visitors each year, most of whom are leisure (as opposed to business) travelers. Sky Harbor Airport, which serves the Greater Phoenix area, serves about 40 million passengers a year, ranking it among the 10 busiest airports in the nation.One of the biggest attractions of the Phoenix area is golf, with over 200 golf courses. In addition to the sites of interest in the city, there are many attractions near Phoenix, such as Agua Fria National Monument, Arcosanti, Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, Lost Dutchman State Park, Montezuma's Castle, Montezuma's Well, and Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. Phoenix also serves as a central point to many of the sights around the state of Arizona, such as the Grand Canyon, Lake Havasu (where the London Bridge is located), Meteor Crater, the Painted Desert, the Petrified Forest, Tombstone, Kartchner Caverns, Sedona and Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff.\n\n\n=== Other attractions and annual events ===\nDue to its natural environment and climate, Phoenix has a number of outdoor attractions and recreational activities. The Phoenix Zoo is the largest privately owned, non-profit zoo in the United States. Since opening in 1962, the zoo has developed an international reputation for its efforts on animal conservation, including breeding and reintroducing endangered species back into the wild. Right next to the zoo, the Phoenix Botanical Gardens were opened in 1939, and are acclaimed worldwide for their art and flora exhibits and educational programs, featuring the largest collection of arid plants in the U.S. South Mountain Park, the largest municipal park in the U.S., is also the highest desert mountain preserve in the world.Other popular sites in the city are Japanese Friendship Garden, Historic Heritage Square, Phoenix Mountains Park, Pueblo Grande Museum, Tovrea Castle, Camelback Mountain, Hole in the Rock, Mystery Castle, St. Mary's Basilica, Taliesin West, and the Wrigley Mansion.Many annual events in and near Phoenix celebrate the city's heritage and its diversity. They include the Scottsdale Arabian Horse Show, the world's largest horse show; Matsuri, a celebration of Japanese culture; Pueblo Grande Indian Market, an event highlighting Native American arts and crafts; Grand Menorah Lighting, a December event celebrating Hanukah; ZooLights, a December evening event at the Phoenix Zoo that features millions of lights; the Arizona State Fair, begun in 1884; Scottish Gathering & Highland Games, an event celebrating Scottish heritage; Estrella War, a celebration of medieval life; Tohono O'odham Nation Rodeo & Fair, Oldest Indian rodeo in Arizona; and the Chinese Week & Culture & Cuisine Festival, a celebration of Chinese culture.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nLike many other western towns, Phoenix's earliest restaurants were often steakhouses. Today, Phoenix is also renowned for its Mexican food, thanks to its large Hispanic population and its proximity to Mexico. Some of Phoenix's restaurants have a long history. The Stockyards steakhouse dates to 1947, while Monti's La Casa Vieja (Spanish for \"The Old House\") was in operation as a restaurant since the 1890s, but closed its doors November 17, 2014. Macayo's (a Mexican restaurant chain) was established in Phoenix in 1946, and other major Mexican restaurants include Garcia's (1956) and Manuel's (1964). The recent population boom has brought people from all over the nation, and to a lesser extent from other countries, and has since influenced the local cuisine. Phoenix boasts cuisines from all over the world, such as Korean, barbecue, Cajun/Creole, Greek, Hawaiian, Irish, Japanese, sushi, Italian, fusion, Persian, Indian (South Asian), Spanish, Thai, Chinese, southwestern, Tex-Mex, Vietnamese, Brazilian, and French.The first McDonald's franchise was sold by the McDonald brothers to a Phoenix entrepreneur in 1952. Neil Fox paid $1,000 for the rights to open an establishment based on the McDonald brothers' restaurant. The hamburger stand opened in 1953 on the southwest corner of Central Avenue and Indian School Road, on the growing north side of Phoenix, and was the first location to sport the now internationally known golden arches, which were initially twice the height of the building. Three other franchise locations opened that year, two years before Ray Kroc purchased McDonald's and opened his first franchise in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Major league ===\n\nPhoenix is home to several professional sports franchises, and is one of only 13 U.S. metropolitan areas to have representatives of all four major professional sports leagues, although only one of these teams actually carry the city name and two of them play within the city limits.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns were the first major sports team in Phoenix, being granted a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise in 1968. They had originally played at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum before moving to America West Arena (now Talking Stick Resort Arena) in 1992. The year following their move to the new arena, the Suns made it to the NBA finals for the second time in franchise history, losing to Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls, 4 games to 2. The U.S. Airways Center hosted both the 1995 and the 2009 NBA All-Star Games.In 1997, the Phoenix Mercury were one of the original eight teams to launch the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). They also play at Talking Stick Resorts Arena. They have won the WNBA championship three times: first in 2007 when they defeated the Detroit Shock, again in 2009 when they defeated the Indiana Fever, and in 2014 when they swept the Chicago Sky.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball began play as an expansion team in 1998. The team has played all of its home games in the same downtown park, now known as Chase Field. It is the second highest stadium in the U.S. (after Coors Field in Denver), and is known for its swimming pool beyond the outfield fence. In 2001, the Diamondbacks defeated the New York Yankees 4 games to 3 in the World Series, becoming the city's first professional sports franchise to win a national championship while in Arizona. The win was also the fastest an expansion team had ever won the World Series, surpassing the old mark of the Florida Marlins of 5 years, set in 1997.The Arizona Cardinals are the oldest continuously run professional football franchise in the nation. Founded in 1898 in Chicago, they moved to Phoenix from St. Louis in 1988 and play in the Western Division of the National Football League's National Football Conference. Upon their move to Phoenix, the Cardinals played their home games at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University in nearby Tempe. In 2006, they moved to the new State Farm Stadium in suburban Glendale. Since moving to Phoenix, the Cardinals have made one championship appearance, Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, where they lost 27\u201323 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nSun Devil Stadium held Super Bowl XXX in 1996. State Farm Stadium hosted Super Bowl XLII in 2008, and Super Bowl XLIX in 2015. It was also selected to host Super Bowl LVII.The Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League moved to the area in 1996, formerly known as the Winnipeg Jets. They originally played their home games at America West Arena in downtown Phoenix before moving in December 2003 to the Jobing.com Arena (now named the Gila River Arena) in Glendale.In 2018, the now-defunct Alliance of American Football announced the league's Phoenix franchise, the Arizona Hotshots, would begin playing in 2019.\n*Note: The Cardinals won two of their championships while in Chicago, pre-modern era.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nThe Phoenix area hosts two annual college football bowl games: the Fiesta Bowl, played at State Farm Stadium, and the Cheez-It Bowl, held at Sun Devil Stadium (though Chase Field has substituted as host while ASU's football stadium undergoes renovations).Phoenix has an indoor football team, the Arizona Rattlers of the Indoor Football League. Their games are also played at Talking Stick Resort Arena. They played in the Arena Football League from 1992 to 2016 and had won five AFL championships before leaving the league.The Greater Phoenix area is home to the Cactus League, one of two spring training leagues for Major League Baseball. With the move by the Colorado Rockies and the Diamondbacks to their new facility in the Salt River Indian Community, the league is entirely based in the Greater Phoenix area. With the Cincinnati Reds' move to Goodyear, half of MLB's 30 teams are now included in the Cactus League.ISM Raceway (originally Phoenix International Raceway) was built in 1964 with a one-mile (1.6 km) oval, with a one-of-a-kind design, as well as a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) road course. It hosts several NASCAR events per season, and the annual Fall NASCAR weekend, which includes events from four different NASCAR classes, is a huge event. Wild Horse Pass Motorsports Park (formerly Firebird International Raceway) hosts NHRA events in the Phoenix metropolitan area.\nThe city also hosts several major professional golf events, including the LPGA's Founder's Cup and, since 1932, The Phoenix Open of the PGA Tour.\nThe Phoenix Marathon is a new addition to the city's sports scene, and is a qualifier for the Boston Marathon. The Rock 'n' Roll Marathon series has held an event in Phoenix every January since 2004. Phoenix is also home to a soccer club, Phoenix Rising FC.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\n\nPhoenix is home to a large number of parks and recreation areas. The city of Phoenix includes national parks, county (Maricopa County) parks and city parks. Tonto National Forest forms part of the city's northeast boundary, while the county has the largest park system in the country.The city park system established to preserve the desert landscape in areas that would otherwise have succumbed to development includes South Mountain Park, the world's largest municipal park with 16,500 acres (67 km2). The system's 182 parks contain over 41,900 acres (16,956 ha), making it the largest municipal park system in the country. The park system has facilities for hiking, camping, swimming, horseback riding, cycling, and climbing. Some of the system's other notable parks include Camelback Mountain, Encanto Park (another large urban park) and Sunnyslope Mountain, also known as \"S\" Mountain. Papago Park in east Phoenix is home to both the Desert Botanical Garden and the Phoenix Zoo, in addition to several golf courses and the Hole-in-the-Rock geological formation. The Desert Botanical Garden, which opened in 1939, is one of the few public gardens in the country dedicated to desert plants, and displays desert plant life from all over the world.\nThe Phoenix Zoo is the largest privately owned non-profit zoo in the United States and is internationally known for its programs devoted to saving endangered species.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nIn 1913, Phoenix adopted a new form of government, switching from the mayor-council system to the council-manager system, making it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government, where a city manager supervises all city departments and executes the policies adopted by the Council. Today, Phoenix represents the largest municipal government of this type in the country.The city council consists of a mayor and eight city council members. While the mayor is elected in a citywide election, Phoenix City Council members are elected by votes only in the districts they represent, with both the Mayor and the Council members serving four-year terms. The mayor of Phoenix is Kate Gallego. The mayor and city council members each have equal voting power in regards to setting city policy and passing rules and regulations. Sunshine Review gave the city's website a Sunny Award for its transparency efforts.\n\n\n=== State government facilities ===\n\nAs the capital of Arizona, Phoenix houses the state legislature, along with numerous state government agencies, many of which are in the State Capitol district immediately west of downtown. The Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections operates the Adobe Mountain and Black Canyon Schools in Phoenix. Another major state government facility is the Arizona State Hospital, operated by the Arizona Department of Health Services. This is a mental health center and is the only medical facility run by the state government. The headquarters of numerous Arizona state government agencies are in Phoenix, with many in the State Capitol district.\n\n\n=== Federal government facilities ===\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons operates the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Phoenix, which is within the city limits, near its northern boundary.The Sandra Day O'Connor U.S. Courthouse, the U.S. District Court of Arizona, is on Washington Street downtown. It is named in honor of retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was raised in Arizona.The Federal Building is at the intersection of Van Buren Street and First Avenue downtown. It contains various federal field offices and the local division of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. This building formerly housed the U.S. District Court offices and courtrooms, but these were moved in 2001 to the new Sandra Day O'Connor U.S. Courthouse. Before the construction of this building in 1961, federal government offices were housed in the historic U.S. Post Office on Central Avenue, completed in the 1930s.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nBy the 1960s, crime was a major problem in Phoenix, and by the 1970s crime continued to increase in the city at a faster rate than almost anywhere else in the country. It was during this time frame when an incident occurred in Phoenix which would have national implications. On March 16, 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested and charged with rape. The subsequent Supreme Court ruling on June 13, 1966, Miranda v. Arizona, has led to practice in the United States of issuing a Miranda Warning to all suspected criminals.With Phoenix's rapid growth, one of the prime areas of criminal activity was land fraud. The practice became so widespread that newspapers would refer to Phoenix as the Tainted Desert. These land frauds led to one of the more infamous murders in the history of the valley, when Arizona Republic writer Don Bolles was murdered by a car bomb in 1976. It was believed his investigative reporting on organized crime and land fraud in Phoenix made him a target.\nBolles was the only reporter from a major U.S. newspaper to be murdered on U.S. soil due to his coverage of a story. Max Dunlap was convicted of first-degree murder in the case.Street gangs and the drug trade had turned into public safety issues by the 1980s, and the crime rate in Phoenix continued to grow.\nAfter seeing a peak in the early and mid-1990s, the city has seen a general decrease in crime rates. The Maricopa County Jail system is the fourth-largest in the country. The violent crime rate peaked in 1993 at 1146 crimes per 100,000 people, while the property crime rate peaked a few years earlier, in 1989, at 9,966 crimes per 100,000.In the most recent numbers from the FBI (2012), those rates stand at 637 and 4091, respectively. Since their peak in 2003, murders have dropped from 241 to 114 in 2014.In 2001 and 2002, Phoenix ranked first in the nation in vehicle thefts, with over 22,000 and 25,000 cars stolen each year respectively. It has declined every year since then, eventually falling to 7,200 in 2014, a drop of almost 70% during that timeframe. The Phoenix MSA has dropped to 70th in the nation in terms of car thefts in 2012.As the first decade of the new century ended, Arizona had become the gateway to the U.S. for drug trafficking. Another crime issue related to the drug trade are kidnappings. In the late 2000s, Phoenix earned the title \"Kidnapping capital of the USA\". Most of the kidnapped are believed to be victims of human smuggling, or related to illegal drug trade, while the kidnappers are believed to be part of Mexican drug cartels.\n\n\n== Cultural Heritage Resources ==\nArizona has museums, journals, societies, and libraries that serve as sources of important cultural heritage knowledge. They include the Arizona State Archives Historic Photographs Memory Project, which includes over 90,000 images that focus on the unique history of Arizona as a state and territory, the Arizona Historical Society, the Journal of Arizona History, and numerous museum databases.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n33 school districts provide public education in the Phoenix area. This is a legacy of numerous annexations over the years; many of the school districts were in existence prior to their territories becoming part of Phoenix. \nThere are 21 elementary school districts, which have over 215 elementary schools, paired with 4 high school districts with 31 high schools serving Phoenix. Three of the high school districts (Glendale Union, Tempe Union, and Tolleson Union) only partially serve Phoenix. In addition, there are 4 unified districts, which cover grades K-12, which add an additional 58 elementary schools and 4 high schools to Phoenix's educational system. Of those four, only the Paradise Valley district completely serves Phoenix. With over 27,000 students, and spread over 220 square miles, Phoenix Union High School District is one of the largest high school districts in the country, containing 16 schools and nearly 3,000 employees. Phoenix is also served by an expanding number of charter schools, with well over 100 operating in the city.\n\n\n=== Post-secondary education ===\n\nArizona State University is the region's largest institution of higher education. While its main campus is in Tempe, ASU also has campuses in northwest Phoenix (ASU West Campus), downtown Phoenix (ASU Downtown Campus), Mesa (ASU Polytechnic Campus), and Glendale (Thunderbird School of Global Management). ASU is one of the largest public universities in the U.S., with a 2012 enrollment of 72,254.\nAn independent, LCME accredited, four-year medical school of the University of Arizona College of Medicine is near ASU's downtown Phoenix campus. There is also a small satellite Phoenix Biomedical Campus for Northern Arizona University (based in Flagstaff).The Maricopa County Community College District includes ten community colleges and two skills centers throughout Maricopa County, providing adult education and job training. Phoenix College, part of the district, was founded in 1920 and is the oldest community college in Arizona and one of the oldest in the country.\n\nThe city is also home to many other institutions of higher learning. Notable institutions include: Barrow Neurological Institute, the world's largest neurological disease treatment and research institution; Grand Canyon University, a private Christian university initially founded in 1949 as a non-profit school, it now operates as a for-profit institution; the University of Phoenix is the nation's largest for-profit university with over 300,000 students at campuses throughout North America, as well as online; and the Arizona Summit Law School, a private, for-profit law school in downtown Phoenix.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nPhoenix's first newspaper was the weekly Salt River Valley Herald, established in 1878, which would change its name the following year to the Phoenix Herald. The paper would go through several additional name changes in its early years before finally settling on the Phoenix Herald, which still exists today in an online form. Today, the city is served by one major daily newspaper: The Arizona Republic, which along with its online entity, azcentral.com, serves the greater metropolitan area. The Jewish News of Greater Phoenix is an independent weekly newspaper established in 1948. In addition, the city is also served by numerous free neighborhood papers and alternative weeklies such as the Phoenix New Times' the East Valley Tribune, which primarily serves the cities of the East Valley; and Arizona State University's The State Press.The Phoenix metro area is served by many local television stations and is the largest designated market area (DMA) in the Southwest, and the 12th largest in the U.S., with over 1.8 million homes (1.6% of the total U.S.). The major network television affiliates are KNXV 15 (ABC), KPHO 5 (CBS), KPNX 12 (NBC), KSAZ 10 (Fox), KASW 61 (The CW), KUTP 45 (MyNetworkTV), and KAET 8 (PBS, operated by Arizona State University). Other network television affiliates operating in the area include KPAZ 21 (TBN),\nKTVW-DT 33 (Univision), KFPH-DT (UniM\u00e1s), KTAZ 39 (Telemundo), KDPH 48 (Daystar), and KPPX-TV 51 (ION). KTVK 3 (3TV) and KAZT 7 (AZ-TV) are independent television stations operating in the metro area. KSAZ-TV, KUTP, KPAZ-TV, KTVW-DT, KFPH-DT, KTAZ, KDPH-LP, and KPPX-TV are network owned-and-operated stations.\nMany major feature films and television programs have been filmed in the city. From the opening sequences in Psycho, to the night attack by the aliens in 1953's The War of the Worlds, to freeway scenes in Little Miss Sunshine, Phoenix has been the location for numerous major feature films. Other notable pictures filmed at least partially in Phoenix include Raising Arizona, A Home at the End of the World, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Days of Thunder, The Gauntlet, The Grifters, Waiting to Exhale and Bus Stop.The radio airwaves in Phoenix cater to a wide variety of musical and talk radio interests. Stations include classic rock formats of KOOL-FM and KSLX-FM, to pop stations like KYOT and alternative stations like KDKB-FM, to the talk radio of KFYI-AM and KKNT-AM, the pop and top 40 programming of KZZP-FM and KALV-FM, and the country sounds of KMLE-FM. With its large Hispanic population there are numerous Spanish stations, such as KHOT-FM and KOMR-FM.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Air ====\n\nPhoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (IATA: PHX, ICAO: KPHX), one of the ten busiest airports in the United States, serves over 110,000 people on over 1000 flights per day. Centrally located in the metro area near several major freeway interchanges east of downtown Phoenix, the airport serves more than 100 cities with non-stop flights.Air Canada, British Airways, Condor, Volaris, and WestJet are among several international carriers as well as American carrier American Airlines (which maintains a hub at the airport) that provide flights to destinations such as Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, and London. In addition to American, other domestic carriers include Alaska Airlines, Delta, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, Sun Country, and United.The Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (IATA: AZA, ICAO: KIWA) in neighboring Mesa also serves the area's commercial air traffic. It was converted from Williams Air Force Base, which closed in 1993. The airport has recently received substantial commercial service with Allegiant Air opening a hub operation at the airport with non-stop service to over a dozen destinations.Smaller airports that primarily handle private and corporate jets include Phoenix Deer Valley Airport, in the Deer Valley district of north Phoenix, and Scottsdale Airport, just east of the Phoenix/Scottsdale border. There are also other municipal airports including Glendale Municipal Airport, Falcon Field Airport in Mesa, and Phoenix Goodyear Airport.\n\n\n==== Rail and bus ====\n\nAmtrak served Phoenix Union Station until 1996 when the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) threatened to abandon the route between Yuma, Arizona and Phoenix. Amtrak rerouted trains to Maricopa, 30 miles (48 km) south of downtown Phoenix, where passengers can board the Texas Eagle (Los Angeles-San Antonio-Chicago) and Sunset Limited (Los Angeles-New Orleans). Though UP retained the trackage and the station remains, Amtrak did not return.\nAmtrak Thruway buses connect Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport to Flagstaff for connection with the Los Angeles-Chicago Southwest Chief. Phoenix is also served by Greyhound bus service, which stops at 24th Street near the airport.\n\nValley Metro provides public transportation throughout the metropolitan area, with its trains, buses, and a ride-share program. 3.38% of workers commute by public transit. Valley Metro's 20-mile (32 km) light rail project, called Valley Metro Rail, through north-central Phoenix, downtown, and eastward through Tempe and Mesa, opened December 27, 2008. Future rail segments of more than 30 miles (48 km) are planned to open by 2030.\n\n\n==== Roads and freeways ====\n\nPhoenix auto traffic depends on both freeways and surface streets. Freeways fall under the auspices of the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT). Phoenix ranks first in the nation in the quality of its urban freeways, and the state as a whole ranks first in the nation in the quality of bridges. While being the fifth most populous city in the nation, Phoenix's freeways do not suffer from the same type of congestion seen in other large cities. In fact, in a recent study, there is not a single stretch of freeway in Phoenix ranked in the 100 worst freeways for either congestion or unreliability.\nPart of the reason for this is the extensive freeway system in the city, due to most of that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985. Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways but no three-digit interstates.As of 2005, the metropolitan area of Phoenix contains one of the nation's largest and fastest growing freeway systems, consisting of over 1,405 lane miles (2,261 lane km). The freeway system is a mix of Interstate, U.S., and state highways which include Interstate 10, Interstate 17, US 60, Loop 101, Loop 202, SR 51, SR 143, and Loop 303. There are still major additions to routes 101, 202 and 303 underway, as well as several other smaller projects around the valley. State Routes 87, 85, and 74 connect Phoenix with other areas of the Valley and Arizona.The street system in Phoenix (and some of its suburbs) is laid out in a grid system, with most roads oriented either north\u2013south or east\u2013west, and the zero point of the grid being the intersection of Central Avenue and Washington Street. The one notable exception to this is the diagonal Grand Avenue, which runs northwest\u2013southeast. The original plan was for the east\u2013west streets to be named after U.S. Presidents, with the north\u2013south streets named after Native Americans; but the north\u2013south streets were quickly changed to numbers, with numbered Avenues running to the west of Central, and numbered Streets to its east.  Major arterial streets are spaced one mile (1.6 km) apart, divided into smaller blocks approximately every 1\u20448 mile (200 m). For example, Scottsdale Road, being the 7200 block east, lies nine miles (14 km) to the east of Central Avenue (72 / 8).Freeways and state highways in Phoenix:\n\n\n==== Alternate forms of transportation ====\nThe Maricopa Association of Governments has a bicycle advisory committee working to improve conditions for bicycling on city streets and off-road paths. Bicycling Magazine ranked Phoenix the 15th most bicycle friendly city of 50 cities in the United States with a population greater than 100,000.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\n\nBeing in the desert, Phoenix relies on a water supply delivered to the city via a system of canals which divert water from the region's rivers and lakes, with the largest portion of the city's water coming from the Colorado River through the Central Arizona Project's canal. The city's electrical needs are served primarily by Arizona Public Service, although some customers receive their electricity from the Salt River Project (SRP). The main sources of electrical generation are nuclear and coal power plants. Arizona is home to the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, the largest nuclear-generating facility in the United States. SRP is also the largest water provider in Phoenix.\n\n\n=== Health care ===\n\nIn 2011 (the last year for which information is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger population than the country as a whole. While the United States had 13.3% of its population over the age of 65, Phoenix's percentage stood significantly lower, at 8.1%. Phoenix's percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45\u201364 was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%. This results in 73% of Phoenix's population being 44 or younger, as compared to the national percentage of 60.In 2010 (the last year for nationally reported figures), Phoenix was at or below national levels for most reportable diseases, with the exception of both hepatitis A and B, where they were slightly over the national average (0.8 and 1.8 to 0.5 and 1.1%, respectively).\n\nIn most major categories, Phoenix had a lower incidence of death than the rest of the nation. Only deaths due to Alzheimer's (29.7 to 27.2 deaths per 100,000) and pre-natal conditions (5.3 to 3.8 deaths per 100,000) were slightly above the national average. Deaths due to HIV and liver disease were exactly at the national average of 2.5 and 10.8 respectively. However, in several major categories, Phoenix had significantly lower indices of death: deaths by cancer stood at only 57% (106) of the national average of 184.6 deaths per 100,000; deaths due to heart disease, 56.1% of the national rate of 249.8 per 100,000. Cancer and heart disease were the two top causes of death in the country.Low-weight births (7.5%) were below the national average of 8.1%, yet infant mortality (7.2%) was higher than the rest of the U.S. (6.1%). Births to teen mothers were significantly higher than the rest of the country, sitting at 12.2% as compared to 8.4% nationally.The Phoenix metropolitan area is serviced by 56 hospitals and medical centers. The Mayo Clinic, a not-for-profit medical practice and medical research group based in Rochester, Minnesota. Phoenix is one of two other locations with Mayo Clinic campuses (the other being Jacksonville, Florida). It is the first and largest integrated not-for-profit medical group practice in the world; Mayo Clinic has been near or at the top of the U.S. News & World Report List of \"Best Hospitals\" for more than 20 years. St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center is part of Dignity Health (formerly Catholic Healthcare West), one of the largest healthcare systems in the western United States. St. Joseph's is a not-for-profit hospital with special advocacy for the poor and underserved. John C. Lincoln North Mountain Hospital is a general medical and surgical hospital, which performed nearly at the level of nationally ranked U.S. News Best Hospitals in 4 adult specialties. The Phoenix Children's Hospital is nationally ranked in 5 pediatric specialties according to U.S. News & World Report. It is a 425-bed children's teaching hospital. Arizona Heart Institute, opened in 1971, is known internationally as one of the first freestanding outpatient clinics dedicated exclusively to cardiovascular health. Banner Health is a non-profit health system in the United States, based in Phoenix. It operates 23 hospitals as well as specialized facilities. The health system is the 2nd largest employer in Arizona, behind Walmart, employing more than 35,000. Banner Health was created in 1999 through a merger of Lutheran Health Systems, based in North Dakota, and Samaritan Health System, based in Phoenix. Of the top 10 rated hospitals in the city (top 12 in the state), 4 are Banner hospitals. Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center is the world's largest dedicated neurosurgical center and a leader in neurosurgical training, research, and patient care. More operative neurosurgical procedures take place at BNI than at any other institution in the United States.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n\nWith the creation of the Phoenix Sister Cities (PSC) organization in 1972, Phoenix became a member of the international Sister City movement. It would take the organization several years to become official, not filing for Articles of Incorporation until 1975, and not entering into their first Sister City agreement until 1976, with Hermosillo, Mexico. The organization's mission statement states their purpose is to \"create people-to-people relationships between the residents of Phoenix and its sister cities through commercial, educational, cultural and artistic exchange programs and events that create and sustain global, long-term, international partnerships and business opportunities for the citizens of Phoenix.\" Phoenix has ten sister cities, as designated by the Phoenix Sister Cities Commission and Sister Cities International, shown in the table below. Phoenix and Prague have shared a Capital Cities relationship since May 1991, which was expanded to Sister City Status in 2013.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGober, Patricia (2006).

          "We stopped at the Phoenix Art Museum to see yhe Ansel Adams photo exhibit. That , of course, was great. But, there is always something unanticipated. They had an exhibition of race cars as art. Cool! Plus there were their usual exhibits of European and American paintings",

          "Other than Legends of Speed, the special exhibit and the Ansel Adams exhibit, the museum was pretty sparse. Very disappointing and not worth the $23 admission fee. The museum building itself and the grounds are very nice, but the many empty halls vacant was unexpected. The",

          "As a Londoner, I\u2019m not used to paying for museums however this was worth every penny! Great exhibitions which are really varied so something for everyone, and something new/different for everyone. Loved the mirror room. A special thank you to all the staff, ESPECIALLY Richard",
          "We went there today and spent $40 for 2 adults and were lucky if we spent an hour there. The useum is under renovation replacing their entire sprinkler system so lots of noise and drilling going on - there is nothing to see on the first floor and limited art work elsewhere.",

          "We attended a Storytellers Project evening, and the ticket included our being able to wander the museum before it started. A lot of the art left me cold, but that's a matter of taste. It is well curated. Don't miss the fireflies!",

          "We came specifically to see the Yayoi Kusama exhibit which would be completely worth the trip. What blew us away was the size of the museum and what was in the permanent collection. Completely unexpected and full of treasures! We went on a Sunday afternoon and was surprised",
          "WOW! This exhibit was twice the size of the usual fashion exhibit at this museum, and it was fascinating! There were items from the 17th century through modern times, and my takeaway was the continuity of use of florals in decoration, whether embroidery or digitally printed. We",
          "The butterfly exhibit starts you off walking in to the museum. While we were there an Agnes Pelton exhibit was featured which was very well done. There were photographs, a mirrored infinity room (not to be missed). The permanent exhibit of paintings offers something for everyone",

          "We visited especially to see current new exhibits--Islamic art, clothing, weapons, etc. Displayed well with educational detail. Also, we liked the work of artist Pelton. The museum has a modest selection of Impressionist work but well worth the trip. European and American",

          "I left the museum feeling ripped off. Nearly $60 for the two of us to see some paper butterflies and some christmas lights in a dark room. I'm being a little grumpy here. I like more experienced or famous artists, Warhol, Miro, Picasso, Twombly, Matisse, etc. Those are how my",

          "When we first moved here, we visited the museum, on a Saturday during high season, and you could hear a pin drop. That was 2004, and the desolate museum felt more like an abandoned mausoleum, with a barely acceptable exhibit collection. Fast-forward to 2017. I took my mother,",
          "We visited the museum on Wednesday. From 3 - 9 it is free. The miniature room collection is wonderful. Amazing all the details in each room display. The highlight of our visit was the dark room with about 10 screens mounted on the walls. A person on each screen was playing one",

But it\u2019s actually a great way to expose children to different types of culture, history and of course, the wide variety of aspects that art means. Did you know",
          "Went to the museum to see the women artists' exhibit which was there and still is. It was really interesting with paintings, clothing, sculptures and other types of art. We also saw an exhibit called \"Fire Flies\" which was intriguing. It was mirrors arranged so it seemed you",

          "There are some nice exhibits here, but it was pretty empty. I always enjoy the firefly room. I also liked the light bulbs with hanging cords on my recent visit. I was very disappointed that both the main gallery and children's area were closed, so please check to see what is",
          "Visited the museum on Wednesday after 3pm since it was free of charge. Did pay an additional $5 per person to view the Women's exhibit in the Steele Gallery. The museum has a very eclectic mix of thought provoking pieces from various time periods. There are many galleries to",
          "This art museum is packed with surprises. The Southwest/Modern Art selection is well worth the visit. It provides a look into the influences the southwest desert has had on artists near and far. It's traveling exhibits keep it fresh and worth visiting again and again.",

          "The museum is always a pleasant visit. My daughter choose here to celebrate her 26th birthday. She wanted to see the firefly installation. She enjoyed it. My 16 yr old son had been to it already. :) However, they had 3 new contemporary pieces he enjoyed! A good time by all",
          "The museum is very spread out and the map is ridiculous. Level 2 is not identified, for instance. The photography area is only an exhibition so don't expect the items listed on line. There are galleries identified by name but you have no idea what they contain. Many",
          "This museum is part of a major activity center, and the art spaces are very cool. When I visited there were some impressive displays of large contemporary art installations. The rooms are very well laid out and easy to move around in. My review pertains to the art galleries.",

          "This was my first visit to the museum...maybe June is just not a good time. It seemed like there were no exhibits... just what is always there. We couldn't believe the amount of open space and bare walls. I must say though that what was there was enjoyable and it was a nice cool",
          "I have been here a couple of times. I really like the spaces in the museum. The exhibits seem to have plenty of room. I feel like the museum has a good Phoenix ambience. The staff is helpful. I went with a school group once and they did a great job with the kids.",
          "Neat and diverse art museum! I went for the free family weekend. At the entrance, there is a beautiful display of butterflies on the wall, one of my favorite pieces. There is a variety of styles, from modern art to art from the 1800s. There are also quite a few walk",

          "We loved the pieces out front of the museum and the waterfall display. There are a lot of exhibits inside the museum, plenty to see. I just though the layout was really confusing and did not find all the exhibits. There is a lot of staff there which was nice, but we felt",

          "We decided to take advantage of a free weekend offered to Bank of America Customers. I have to state upfront that I am not a fan of modern art. The big American section was closed for renovations. I did enjoy the Far East exhibit and the little European art that was there. I",
          "The museum is very interesting even though some sections are much less interesting than others. The building is very attractive and so you can enjoy the visit even more.",
          "We came primarily to see the Yayoi Kusama fireflies installation, which was beautiful, but I felt that entry to the museum was a little expensive for what was on offer otherwise. In the museum's defence two rooms were closed off while work was replaced/ a reception of some kind",

          "I realize from the other reviews that I am an outlier, but we just were not that impressed. There are some excellent pieces but by and large it seems to be a hodge-podge of whatever their patrons have donated. If time is limited and you only want to do one museum, head to the",
          "If you have time do go to this place. The building and itself is a must see and the expositions are also top notch. I was very much surprised that there is not enough advertising on this place since it is so nice.",

          "Phoenix Art Museum has a commendable collection of art spanning antiquity to modern stuff. Recommended.",
          "The size and variety at this Museum made for a perfect afternoon. It was small enough that I never hit saturation in any one exhibit or gallery and large enough that they had an extremely diverse collection. There are lots of Calders, a Monet that literally took my breath away,",
          "We love the exhibit, my 12 year old can't wait to go. So many different exhibits, and they change, but some do stay in house. There's art to appreciate, and exhibits that you can take part in, it's wonderful.",
          "Now one of my most favorite. It is expansive so plenty of space to wander get up front without bumping up against other visitors. \u201cGuards so prominent in other museums wear black tee shirts some in English some in Spanish stating \u201cHow can I Help\u201d and they do. We had a personal",
          "While the museum is impressive in size, there are really not a lot of art work. Comparing with many museums on the east, it is jarring to see one painting on a whole wall. It has focus on modern and contemporary art, and it has many painters from Latin American counties,",
          "I always have a great time when I go. I really want to go more frequently. I took my adult son to the Samurai Armor exhibit this summer and we both loved it.",
          "There's something for everyone at this art museum - contemporary, classic, old masters, up-and-comers, paintings, sculpture, and even experiential exhibits. The gift shop is superb and the restaurant is completely lovely.",

          "There is something for everyone : asian art, classic european art, contemporary shows.....not many sculptures though. I loved the firefly room but the art videos were disappointing. All in all, I loved it but would not go more than once a year if I lived here.",
          "The museum has galleries that are really impressive. Many traveling shows that are worth seeing. Go often and truly experience a fine collection.",
          "I spent about 3 hours at the Art Museum several weeks ago and my primary purpose for going was to see the documentary WasteLand. It was an excellent documentary and held my interest for several hours. I also visited several exhibitions and plan to go back next month to explore",
          "Free day at the museum was fun. Lots of kids enjoying learning about art. Cafe food was good and service attentive. Love this museum!",
          "Visited here during one of their free Wednesday promotions. A bit difficult to find parking and navigate (for a single out-of-towner), but once there was a nice place to spend an hour or two. Not a huge building with excessive art collection, but was a nice way to unwind at the",

          "The museum is in a very nice building which had multi levels, it was interesting to see the diversity in the art that is displayed. This a great way to get out of the heat of the day and enjoy some really nice art work. This is a must see when you are in phoenix",
          "I have attended many special events through the years at the Phoenix Art Museum. But I really enjoy the special exhibits there. I discover all types of artists (e.g. Sheila Pepe) whom I never would have known about. The staff is very friendly as well.",
          "Disappointed with our visit, there were a ew interesting exhibits and installations but too much that didn't excite.",
          "The Yayoi exhibit on the top floor has no line and you an stay in there as long as you want!!!!! I definitely went there for it and was pleasantly surprised by all the other art installations they had there. They also seemed to have a section of events arranged for kids to learn",
          "They recommend two hours, give or take, without the special exhibits. I could've easily spent half a day without the special exhibits. It's a wonderful collection with great variety. I also loved the special exhibit, \"Past/Future/Present: Contemporary Brazilian Art from the",

          "This is a very enjoyable museum, ranging from old masters to brave-new-world experiments in art. I would like to point out the restaurant, a good-food cure for \"museum legs.\" I enjoyed the arugula/pears/chicken/walnuts. The service is great, location good. It's actually a",
          "This museum has a good collection for a city of this size. The most interesting part is that there are many areas for special shows. When I was there there was a interesting Brazilian Contemporary show. The photo collection looks like it was curated by one person. The",
          "This museum was hyped by every travel site and book I referenced. But I don't understand why. The layout is confusing and difficult to navigate and at the end of it all there is very little art. First it was rather expensive to enter and it did not seem to be a suggested",

          "Went on a Wednesday after 3pm and it was FREE! In particular, enjoyed the Schor collection and the Thorne Minature Room which were very unique. Although not the NGA or MMA, it is very well maintained and good displays. The building itself is facinating and a bit of a challenge",
          "We wandered through the museum for a couple of hours and also had lunch at the cafe. We especially enjoyed the dress collection and the Georgia O'Keeffe's - part of the southwestern exhibit in the lower level. The Firefly room was awesome, too!",

          "While not at the level of some other big city museums, the Phoenix Art Museum has a good variety of art on display. One of my favorite things is the Thorne Miniature Room. There are many more of these rooms in the Art Institute of Chicago, but the Phoenix Art Museum has several",
          "The Phoenix Museum of Art is totally worth a visit. The facility is in a league with much more well known museums. The staff is very helpful and eager to please. There is a small but exquisite collection of Impressionist masterpieces as well as European masters. Easy to find and",
          "The museum is easy to get to by the Phoenix light rail. I went on a Wednesday afternoon and admission was free, so that was a bonus. There are lots of interesting exhibits, some of them 'one only' like the small but lovely Turner, and it was an enjoyable afternoon.",
          "I like this place so much I have a membership. The museum holds various loaned exhibits a year that are amazing. Most recently, I took my nephew and his wife to the Samauri exhibit. They also offer art classes (free and paid), art movies, lectures, galas. The museum's own",

          "So much to see. Took my 11 year old who I didn't think would appreciate an art museum, she loved it! The fire flies room was cool, I loved the bluebird tree and the miniatures were superb. There wasn't anything not to like and to top it all the deal on the annual membership",
          "Phoenix has lots of great museums in the downtown area...and this Art museum is one of them. Easy parking near by and makes an enjoyable day out of the Arizona heat...there are lots of nice places to eat down town to you can make a date out of it!! enjoy",
          "The Phoenix Art Museum has wonderful, thought provoking exhibits and can be always counted on to stimulate your mind. Another plus is free admissions on Wednesday afternoons and on First Friday'! Take a few hours out of the heat and get in touch with your creative side!!",
          "Visited in 2015, revisited it again in 2016 and although some of the items have been switched out like you'd expect the overall feel, experience etc is still quite good. Still a place I'd visit again.",

          "This was Family Weekend at the Museum so admission was free and they had a lot of creative activities for children including dancing, making collages, or painting. We went with our daughter, son-in-law and their 2 children ages 3 years and 18 months. Everyone had a great time!",
          "This museum offers you a little bit of everything. Even fashion. There's a mix of small and large spaces. Asian and european art. Sculpture, film, modern art and special exhibits. It's easy to spend an afternoon or a quick trip for a culture fix. It's nice to see this",
          "Overall, the collections that I did see were mostly interesting. Of particular interest is the Schorr collection, which is spread throughout the building in different areas. I especially enjoyed Goya's Caprices. The contemporary art section has a lot of thought-provoking pieces,",
          "I brought an overseas guest to experience some of our local culture. We enjoyed the displays and indigenous artwork. Thank you for a clean well kept museum.",
          "Seemed to have started collecting late in the game so major 20th century painting and sculptures are rare. But they have a good changing contemporary collection. Nice small Asian one. And some good western paintings",
          "I'm still giving this 4 stars because of the restaurant on site! Staring out when we entered I was so excited because ive never been here before and I love looking at art and sculptures. To be honest I was a little let down with the exhibits because there wasnt alot. there was a",

          "Loved the Samurai exhibition. It was amazing to be able to get close to the exhibits and enjoy the detail of the fabric. Beautiful exhibit but one problem -not enough places to sit. Ridiculously small area for movie. What few seats there were, were taken by children",
          "Tired of the heat? Then spend a day at the Art Museum and enjoy a meal or a snack at the restaurant. Wear you walking shoes and enjoy the coolness of the building and the beautiful art around the world. Some of the artists are new while others are deceased. Some of the art is",
          "Depending on the time and the season, you can get a table by the window at Pallette, which makes you feel like you're eating outside. The food is good, with some unusual (but yummy) choices and some familiar dishes. For a taste of the southwest, try their slow-roasted pork",

          "The Phoenix Art Museum is a delightful place to get out of the heat and sun and enjoy inspiring art. The keep the exhibits fresh and diverse so multiple visits in not a out of the norm. There Phoenix Theater is there and a great cafe to eat and relax. I live here and visit",
          "It's been decades since we were last here and were reminded why we need to come more often. The exhibits were well displayed and the short films were very informative. The additional exhibit of Frida Kahlo & Diego Rivera were exceptional.",
          "Expecting to be whowed by art isn't exactly a pipe dream for visiting an art museum. We went there to see the samuari exibit, which was interesting. The remainder of the museum was divoid of art. No masters, nothing in the talanted local artist genre. You are better served",

          "This is a nice way to spend a few hours roaming through the variety of pieces that range in genre and time periods. Seemingly eclectic set. Renovated space and different add-one make the layout rather confusing. I didn't think the map was sufficiently descriptive different",
          "General Admission is $18/adult. It is worth paying the $5 extra to see the Samurai Exhibit. The Samurai warriors in full suits of armor, helmets, masks, weapons, horse tack, etc. is very impressive. Enjoyed the great works in the Schorr Collection. One of my favorites would",
          "I finally took sometime an explored this museum and it was great. There was a good blend of different time periods and cultures. At times it was noisy due to echoes of people talking, I think it's worth the trip. Overall a good time especially on a hot day.",

          "There's some decent artwork here, including some really cool sculptures, but you can easily get through the general admission area in an hour and a half, which disappointed me. Self-guided is probably a mistake. You'd get more out of it by having a tour guide. I'd say my",

          "Went to see the display on Samurai and their armour. It is very interesting and well displayed. The lighting could have been a bit brighter or the signage a bit bigger. It was difficult to read some of the descriptions. There were school children there which was great to see",

          "We have been members of the Museum for decades. I think the staff does a good job. It is large and airy and the special exhibitions are usually good. The permanent collection is middle market which reflects the thin support in the donor market. I'd say don't miss it, but repeat",

          "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, hence the range of opinions about this museum. It's not NYC's MOMA but it is a nice small museum. One should not plan on visiting a museum for more than two hours anyway. Best to check its' website first to get an idea of what you might",

          "Lots to see here! As a relatively new collection (by east/west coast or European standards) doesn't have lots of blockbuster works, but it does have less well known works by some of the big names which are interesting to see. The collection focused on the south-west and Arizona",
          "The museum has local artists from 1930's to present as well as two Monet's and a Pizarro. There is an oriental area, modern area, medival area, as well as a gift shop and restaurant. The price for admission is very reasonable.",

We will definitely be coming back soon.",

There are always great new exhibits. Really a thought provoking beautiful space in the middle of a bustling metropolitan area.",

          "The collection here is nothing to turn your nose up at. The traveling exhibitions are usually very good. But the staff does leave something to be desired. Young people who are interested in art should not be treated like unwelcome guests.",
          "Nice facility with a diverse collection but comparatively little depth because of the museum's size",
          "It was a quick stop before going to Los Angeles but this museum was fantastic! The art exhibitions were incredible.",
          "Always fun! Especially on First Friday.",
          "I am a little biased because I love art, but this place great! Great service to!",
          "Kid friendly.  Great place to explore.  Staff are always ready to answer questions.",
          "The architecture is modern and works great with the desert feel.  Big exhibits that will impress you and they change frequently.  I highly recommend a visit.  ",
          "A real GEM of a place, not to be missed.  Large and spacious galleries, plenty of room to pace yourself and not feel pushed.  Splendid display themes.  Wednesdays are FREE.",
          "Family and I decided to have a day at the museum.  Phoenix Art museum was a fun choice.  It has two levels.  It needs more signs inside and a sign showing the main entrance for the actual museum instead of the theater.  Loved the modern art section, the star room was my family favorite.",
          "Free art museum hours Wednesday nights until 9pm are wonderful.",
          "Nice regional class museum that sometimes  hosts national class traveling exhibits. Nice southwest collection and a surprisingly good Asian collection ",

          "I went with the family on a \"free second Sunday\" as we were on vacation, it was raining, and seemed like a good activity. The parking lot is shared with a theater and it was pure insanity. I would not be surprised if fist fights broke out \u2026",
          "This wasn't the best museum I've been to.  It wasn't the worst.  The caf\u00e9 has good food, with somewhat expensive prices (worth a repeat visit).  The exhibits from the permanent collection were easy to take in within a couple of hours.  I wouldn't return, unless it was to eat at the caf\u00e9.",
          "We all enjoyed the art as well as the beautiful building housing the collection. Not for small children, as they would quickly get bored. Also, many valuable pieces are not well protected.",
          "You can go to this museum over and over again and never see the same thing.  It's a pretty big place, with multiple levels and changing exhibits.  It's a fantastic place to come year round, but it's especially fun to come in the summer when \u2026",
          "Large museum with lots of diverse exhibits. My family lived it here. The guided tour was awesome.",
          "I was in town for a conference and decided to check out the museum during my spare time. I enjoyed seeing the special modernism exhibit as well as the permanent collection. Phoenix is fortunate to have such a treasure.",
          "Great art work is present here and very encouraging stuff is present here.Lots of crowd when I attended it.Great place to learn about art.",
          "I love the Phoenix Art Museum, it is very large, multi-level and has a wide variety of artworks in the permanent collection. I recently went to the History of Video Games exhibit. I enjoyed seeing all of the historic gaming systems but felt \u2026",
          "Magnificent \u2763\ufe0f",

          "Awesome museum and works of art on display. Staff is super friendly. ",
          "Nice collection of art in a calming atmosphere.",
          "Great art, clean and spacious but horrible staff. They don't let you enjoy the art, following you around even if you are sitting down, and if you point with anything else that  isn't part of your body, you will be approached by an \"art agent\". Always point with your hips. ;) ",
          "Place is just lovely and free on Wednesdays. Highly recommend it.",
          "Pollice Verso, 1872 by Gerome. Nuff said. Great museum. Easy parking, easy location. Serves cocktails. Nice southwestern pieces. Teachers and college students get in free. Nice menu. ",
          "Modern art selection was great",
          "We enjoyed wandering through the galleries on a hot summer day- so much to see!",
          "The place is wonderful, but I was trying to call to get the name of a painting that I had seen and waited for over 25 minutes on hold with their silly automated voice message and then got disconnected. Seems that no operators want to answer the phones today.",
          "Great museum. BUT WHY ARE YOU CLOSED ON A MONDAY. A MONDAY I WANTED TO GO BUT ITS CLOSED ON A MONDAY. Mnmmm",
          "Great museum. Took a few hours to get through everything. Worth the price of admission just for Yayoi Kusama's infinity mirror room.",
          "Lovely place for a date! Plenty of parking, nice staff, check out their reduced price or free evenings!",
          "I will never go back. The most incompetent staff I have ever met in my life.",
          "I love this place. So much to see. Great for the families to enjoy.",
          "From what I remember: a contemporary building - fun to have a walk around.",
          "Loved it",
          "Really interesting museum. Some of the paintings are just brillaint and can keep you standing stairring for hours. The Asian artifacts room is intriguing to be in. The entry fee is not bad at all. They even have some seasonal and special \u2026",
          "Wonderful collection of art.  And a beautiful building too.",
          "really nice exhibits. modern and classic. 18 bucks tho. ",
          "The Museum has a great variety of different art.",
          "I love coming here there is always something new to see and I never get through the whole museum which is nice, there is always something to look forward too.",
          "Sadly I went while one of the galleries wad closed, buy still had a great time and can't wait to go back. There was a special fashikm exhibiy going in for an additional fee that I did not takr advantage of. But you could still view the \u2026",

          "Great place to bring the family.",
          "Reviewed the Art Museum today of Phoenix,\nI must say I was very impressed to find low and high Renaissance original pieces,\nWas not expecting to find these gems in the desert.\nChief curator Gilbert Vicario has taste indeed!.\nWhich a whole \u2026",
          "I really like this museum. It had Yayoi Kusama's fireflies / infinity Room with no lines and stay as long as you want.I'd return here again and again.",
          "The third floor space with the fireflies is a must see for anyone visiting phoenix. Love how often they are free for youth on wednesdays and open to the public ever first friday",
          "It is the biggest art museum I've been so far. All the art work is quite amazing. My favorite thing is the neon room. When I entered the room, I felt like floating among stars, or standing at a peak of a mountain and looking at the night \u2026",
          "I've been living here and visiting this museum for 30 years, and I keep hoping it will wake up. The collection is pathetic...I'm not sure why, this is the 5th largest city in the country, and I'm sure there are many many retired people from \u2026",
          "Great place to visit here in the local Phoenix area. Make sure to check their event calendar for any upcoming events!",
          "The Michelangelo exhibit took my breath away!! \nThe White Shirt experience was just amazing and the restaurant is a must just for the truffle fries!! ",

          "Great place to go after school/work on Wednesdays, since the admissions are free after 3pm. The Art is breathtaking. ",
          "I went when they had the Frida Kahlo and an American flag (Old Glory) type exhibit. I did have a good time. I only went to two exhibits, and never went back. So, I liked it, but did not love it."

        "wiki": "Mystery Castle is located in the city of Phoenix, Arizona, in the foothills of South Mountain Park. It was built in the 1930s by Boyce Luther Gulley for his daughter Mary Lou Gulley.  After learning he had tuberculosis, Gulley moved from Seattle to the Phoenix area and began building the house from found or inexpensive materials.  Boyce Gulley died in 1945, and Mary Lou and her mother were notified by attorney that they had inherited the property. Shortly after, the mother and daughter moved in.\nTheir story attracted attention, giving the home some notoriety as well as its exotic name:  A Life Magazine story (January 26, 1948)  used the headline  \"Life Visits a Mystery Castle: A Young Girl Rules Over the Strange Secrets of a Fairy Tale Dream House in the Arizona Desert.\" The photograph featured Mary Lou posing atop the cantilever staircase leading to the roof of the house.  That same year, Mary Lou and her mother began offering tours of the home.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nSaid to be held together by a combination of mortar, cement, calcium, and goat milk, the sprawling 18-room, three story castle is built from a wide range of materials \u2014 stone, adobe, automobile parts, salvaged rail tracks from a mine, telephone poles, etc. It features a chapel, cantina, and a dungeon. Parts of the castle remain unfinished, and electricity and plumbing weren't added until 1992.  As the housing boom progressed in Phoenix, new development encroached close to the castle and its grounds, making it far less isolated.\nMary Lou Gulley died on November 3, 2010. The property is now maintained by the Mystery Castle Foundation, a 501c3 non-profit organization.The Mystery Castle has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of historic properties in Phoenix, Arizona\nPhoenix Historic Property Register\nTovrea Castle\nEl Cid Castle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMystery Castle - official site\nArticle and photos with contact information about the Mystery Castle\nArticle and photos\nPhotos taken on Jan. 8, 2011",

          "Visited here last year. Always heard about it but never went. Such a gem for Phoenix who has not much history compared to the East Coast where I grew up. You even get some great views. Go during cooler weather and you can hike South Mountain Preserve directly behind it. If you",
          "We were looking for something to fill in some time. I gave my husband some choices and this is what he chose. So glad he did! This castle is phenomenal. So different from anything we have seen before. Our guide was great, full of information. A definite plus to our road trip.",
          "This is an interesting place. There is a good story and the guide was informative and enthusiastic. It was fairly inexpensive and quick. I don\u2019t need to visit again, but I\u2019m glad I visited once.",
          "I expected this castle to be unique and it did not disappoint on that. Basically, a man fled his family (due to TB) and came to the hot dry climate of Phoenix for a cure. Having no money (and living in isolation) he started to build his home from salvaged and recycled material.",
          "This is one of those \"lower tier\" tours that is a super value at $10 a head. The story of the builder and the unique result of his efforts are well worth the price. Our docent was knowledgeable and personable. A definite stop to please you.",
          "Who knew that, after driving thru the vast somewhat anonymous south Phoenix suburbs you\u2019d find a castle that is this distinct. That was built by a father with tuberculosis to fulfill his daughter\u2019s dreams. That was built entirely by hand using found, used, and rejected",
          "Great fun for all ages excellent guides well informed. A little known venue close to Mesa and Phoenix. Well worth the visit",
          "Quite eclectic and very interesting albeit pretty rundown. Make sure you speak with the docents. They are quite helpful.",
          "We had heard about and read online about the Mystery Castle. What we saw on the tour, however, was so much more than online words and pictures can provide. Our tour guide was friendly, upbeat, and knowledgeable. Our group was quite large, but the Castle can accommodate a larger",
          "As a 15 year resident of Phoenix I knew of The Mystery Castle but had never visited it. Dumb. Don\u2019t miss this fabulous dream creation by a hard working loving father and ingenious creator. Mr. Gulley was a true Phoenician Spirit! Reward yourself and help save this jewel of",
          "Loved the tour. If you like quirky, off the beaten track sights with a fascinating story, you will love this. Unbelievable creativity with all original furnishings led by knowledgeable guides this trip is not to be missed. Interesting note: the caretaker who worked and lived on",
          "If your someone who loved the unusual, you will love this place. It's full of interesting stories and obscure design. It makes for some interesting stories to tell your family when you get home!",
          "I\u2019ve never heard of this place and wanted to check it out. Very interesting story and unique home. It is mostly outside with stairs and uneven surfaces (just as a heads up) but easy and quick to explore. Nice for something quick to do with friends or by yourself.",
          "I couldn\u2019t help but feel very sad when we finished our visit to Mystery Castle. Maybe it was the story of how Boyce Gulley left Seattle for Arizona when he learned that he had tuberculosis, and didn\u2019t tell his poor wife and young daughter that he was leaving. Maybe it was all",
          "Had some extra time in the Phoenix area and stopped by Mystery Castle. Definitely one of a kind. Tour guide was great. I went in November which seems to be a good time. Summer they say is Too hot and possible snakes. Life Is Good",

          "This is an unexpected gem. Not your run of the mill castle. Its quirky and a little weird, but very entertaining. Our guide was very knowledgeable and kind. He answered questions and gave everyone time to take whatever photos they wanted. I enjoyed my visit more than I thought I",
          "The Mystery Castle was closed when we got there. We were able to see things from the gate. It sure looked like it would have been cool to visit. From the looks of things, there is a lot of construction going on around the area. I hope that it does not effect the future of this",
          "Located in South Phoenix, the Mystery Castle is a tale of true love, isolation, and ingenuity. A little off the beaten path, but worth the drive. The charge to enter is decent and it includes a guided tour around the property with a good explanation of the history and use of",
          "This is a very difficult place to describe. A very unusual home with an interesting history. A wonderful place to wander through!",

          "If you're looking for something truly historic to visit...this isn't it. This is one of those quirky places that an individual built for his own reasons (in this case to fulfill a daughter's childhood fantasy) that's just sort of interesting. Over the years it has developed",
          "My friends and I went to visit the Mystery Castle this past month. We went on a Thursday and arrived at 11:00, our tour guide was very informative. We explored this unique \u201ccastle\u201d for just over an hour. I will never forget the amazing details in the construction of this",

          "Much like Coral Castle in Florida, a man built a castle for his daughter (not girlfriend lijevin Florida). It\u2019s such a heartwarming - and heartbreaking story - but well worth the trip just a few miles from Sky Harbor. The yours are cash only and don\u2019t offer any amenities but",
          "This is a most interesting history to hear and site to see. There is some uneven steps. Wear walking shoes.",
          "I believe this place is a bit misleading....it's just an old house that was built in Phoenix...there's not even a bathroom you can use (there's a porto potty outside). I didn't really see the point. Wasn't worth the trip.",

          "I\u2019ve been here several times. Took family there that hadn\u2019t been there before. Always interesting to hear the story and imagine building and living there. If you are into out of the way interesting parts of American history, check it out",
          "Took the tour - interesting history as to how the place came to be. Wouldn't call it a castle but an eclectic home. Certainly a piece of Phoenix history.",
          "They have limited hours here, especially in the warmer weather, check to make sure they are open before you go. Beautiful location on the side of South Mountsin, you can see all over the city. I have brought guests here several times and some of the guides are better than others",
          "Definitely not a open floor plan! Lots of rooms and nooks and crannies. The builder created an odd and very interesting building out of materials he found for free throughout the desert. It's fantastic! The decor is junky but original to the daughter of the builder. The tour",
          "It was a good tour , our Guide explained everything in detail He was very familiar with History of it . I recommend going during the week and earlier the better when there is smaller crowd.",
          "We enjoyed the tour, the stories, the never-ending eccentricities of the house and the occupants. The directions to get there were sparse, and we only found the place because the street we were on dead-ended near their gate. No real signs. If you have any physical",
          "Mystery Castle may not be an actual castle but there is something wonderful about a structure built by a non-builder. The floors aren't level, the windows are odd sizes some which come from car parts and the rooms are full folk art. What made this place especially unique was the",
          "Very interesting and loved the price and the docents. It's only 10 dollars to get in and South Mountain is beautiful.",
          "This is definitely worth going to see! And well worth the cost of admission. The guides are knowledgeable about the history of the house and family. So many fun stories. There are some great things to see as you go around. Our group was myself, husband, 7 yr old and my parents.",

          "Built on the slopes of South Mountain during the Depression and through WWII this home is certainly unique, interesting and odd. It is certainly worth an hour or two to take the tour and explore the property.",
          "This is a strange-if not weird- attraction. The story behind the house is very interesting, but the \"castle\" is nothing more than some knick-knacks collected over time. It's literally off the beaten the path- and the road leading to the castle is unpaved and parking is",
          "Road into the castle is unpaved, rocky with ruts; parking is very limited; restroom is a port a potty. The castle itself is a story unto itself. Built in 1st half of 20th century by a dying father for his beloved daughter, it was constructed of anything he could find, salvage or",
          "We stayed in the 2nd floor, 2 BR, 1 BA unit. While the stairs are a little tricky to maneuver with suitcases, my 83 year old mother managed okay while holding onto the rails. Both beds were very comfortable. Cozy living room with electric fireplace/heater. Kitchen was small but",
          "Being a native, I've been here a few times and soooo very interesting! You have to come here for the story as well as for her home. (Look it up) I made it when she was still living in her 90's. I understand she passed about 4-5 yrs. ago (?). There is now a charge but don't",

          "A very interesting about the construction of the Mystery Castle! All the free material of the times that the builder was able to get and his idea of the design. Concrete floors so they just need to be hosed down. A lot of modern ideas went into this vast home.Rather open and I",
          "I haven't been here for years, but when family come to visit, it's always on our list. We have never had anyone disappointed in this attraction.",
          "Not so sure how many people know about this place, but it should be widely known. Check the hours ahead of time because it is a bit away. There is an entrance fee. Tours are done all day and you jump right in wherever they are at until you cycle through. So much history to that",
          "I really enjoyed the tour of the home by the daughter before she passed away. Well worth the visit for a place to get a touch of the unusual!",
          "I don't know why they call it the Mystery castle, but it still is a very cool place. The history behind the house is amazing. The guy built this from recycled materials going back almost 100 years. They have tour guides that are very good at giving you all the interesting",
          "We visited this and really enjoyed it ! Not only the story that goes along with it, but the uniqueness and the imagination the builder had when building this for his daughter ! He used everything possible using mostly recycled materials .... quite a mind he had! Very interesting",
          "The place is really neat with a lot of good ideas for design. The guide was very informative but putting some humor into the tour would make it so much better. It\u2019s 10$ cash to get in so stop at the atm on the way.",
          "It's not even that good of a story. It's definitely very goofy and the tour took too long. Instead of 10 people our tour guide made us wait and accumulated too many people, we were around 30!!!!! Very not cool.",
          "What a castle! It is quirky, interesting and fun to visit. Something different as sightseeing goes. Give it a chance.",
          "This eclectic home is quite interesting, as is the story behind it and the man who built it. The castle is open Thurs-Sunday and $10 cash. So full of stuff that you need to look twice, high & low to take it all in. Our guide was very nice & informative. There are stairs & uneven",
          "The building itself is fantastic! We went here to fulfill one of my son's Cub Scout requirements. The tour guides were very nice. The one we had was very loud (overly loud). The house was also full of knick knacks. Took away from the beauty of the house. I am glad we went",
          "A group of about went for the tour. It was $10 each and I thought it was a little pricey for what you got. There were several areas you could not see & the gift shop was more like a small resell-it shop. I guess I'm glad I went, but will not return.",
          "This castle has a very interesting story behind it and one you need to hear before visiting the castle. The man put his whole life into building this for his daughter and made sure it wouldn't wash away. It is an easy walk to get to it but the floors are very bumpy because off",
          "Was fascinated by this place to see such a collection of objects collected and built into a family home.",
          "The Mystery Castle was extremely interesting, although a little hard to find. There were many steps and levels, which would be hard for those with mobility issues. That being said, it was well worth the effort to see.",

          "This place is hard to describe. It is cute and they have a long history of doing tours. \n\nIt is important to note that not only is this place not wheel chair accessible, but anyone with any mobility difficulties or has difficulty walking \u2026",
          "Could you imagine being given six months to live, only to ghost your wife and child to then spend FIFTEEN YEARS cheating death by constructing a castle for your only daughter? It's badass-can't wait to go back in the fall for their ghost tour",
          "Very strange place. Gorgeous building decorated as it was left by the last resident (builder's daughter). Knowledgeable guides.",
          "It was a GREAT experience!!!! The best part was taking the tour because both the guides told me the story in details and answered all my questions. \nI loved the reason WHY he built the castle and also how and why the daughter moved in.\nIt \u2026",
          "Completely enjoyed this visit.",
          "This is not a conventional castle. It history is interesting. We enjoyed it.",

          "I visited previously in 2002 when Mary Lou was still leading tours (didn't realize that until I looked at my photos). The tour guide this year, 2/21/19 did a fantastic job informationally, and it was crazy how little I recognized or \u2026",
          "Definitely one of Arizona's oddities. It's not exactly a castle - it's more of a large house. There's an interesting story behind the dwelling... The man who built it had tuberculosis and left his family in Seattle, and then left the house \u2026",
          "I've heard great things about this place. If you go in a large group, I advice you split up because the rooms are small. It is not open in the Summer. I believe its October to May. Cute and quirky.",
          "Great place to visit!  Closed during the summer!  Really interesting tour!",

          "So interesting....a must see!",
          "Have not been able to see it yet. It appears it is only open from October to May. This was found on their actual website. This should be noted on trip adviser but I could not figure out how to do it. Looks like a fun place to visit.",
          "Very cool building showing old west style. Very 'Arizona'.",

          "\ud83d\udc4d An example of what one person can do, by applying themselves every day.  ...Read me\n\nThis is a learning experience, an experience of revelation regarding one's own ambitions and the consistent dedication to those efforts.\n\nGuidepost.us",

          "Very interesting I highly recommend taking a tour, our tour guide was fantastic!",
          "Please note:  Most of the negative reviews are by the same person \"Ryan\" who must have a personal beef. Why else would he write multiple bad reviews?  Move on.  This is an interesting, quirky place and worth the time and money.  \"Open\" hours are not always what is posted on the website.",

          "Very cool",
          "Well worth the trip and $10 fee to join the tour. When you get there you just join the Neverending tour which constantly loops through the house. There is even a letter from Bill Clinton from when Mary Leu refused to give him a tour.\n\nMake sure you go in the winter, they are closed in the summer.",

          "Well worth the time,$$ to see this unique dwelling & learn the history!",
          "Firstly bring cash if you want to go on the tour. The house/castle is cool. The tour was a disappointment. We entered and were greeted by a very friendly entusisastic guy who lead us upstairs thinking we were going to be able to walk around \u2026",

          "Such a strange place and a really interesting story.",

          "We had an awesome time visiting this little piece of Arizona history. The story behind it is both sad and amazing. The tour guides are so friendly and knowledgeable about the house and it's history. The views are beautiful as well. We really enjoyed visiting and will definitely be back again someday!",

          "Absolutely glad I visited this place!  Not wheelchair accessible.  Some stairs. Sad story behind how this place,was built.   Architecture is reminiscent of the House on the Rock in Wisconsin. Gift shop is quirky, just like the rest of the house.",
          "Very interesting house!!! Cool to tour",
          "Interesting, place with excellent tour guides. The only issue was other visitors not waiting to start their tour. Creating to large of group.",
          "A quirky cool place to visit at least once and a great place to bring out of town visitors. The guides are knowledgeable. The view of the city is spectacular. Wear tennis shoes as the staircases are steep and narrow and the floors are uneven.",
          "Was very disappointed. We are visiting Phoenix from out of state. We went out there 2 different times and both times the website said it was open but where we were the gate was locked and there was no other signs telling how to get to the the mystery castle",
          "There was lots of love still emanating through those stones and a solid foundation which will defy time. Boyce made things out out of nothing. He was king of the poor Frank Lloyd Wright of his generation.   F.L.Wright was entirely sponsored \u2026",
          "This place is so cool!! The story behind it and its history are one of a kind. You can read all about it, but it's so much better to visit in person and hear about it from somebody who knew the longtime inhabitant.",
          "fenced off blocked by metal fences \nlooks cool too explore",
          "Sure, it's an interesting piece of Arizona history, but for $10, I guess I expected more. It is cash only, $10/adult and $5/kid, and the \"gift shop\" has very little available in terms of commemorative items. I would suggest they have postcards made. I didn't even notice if there was a bathroom available, but I doubt it.",
          "Great place to go and spend a few hours. Listen to a piece of Arizona history on the tour. Enjoy the bric-a-brac around the house as you explore the rooms.",

          "It is marketed as a castle with an interesting back story. In reality it is a massive pile of literally trash that was owned by an eccentric hoarder who abandoned his family. I wouldn't say it was worth the admission.",
          "Wonderful true fairytale about the labor of love! Absolutely fascinating to gaze upon this piece of architecture and think that it was built by one man with a duration of 15 years in the making! My kids really enjoyed it and we will \u2026",

          "It was worth the trip.   It's a very unique building with an interesting story.  It's very eclectic.  There is no gift shop, bring your own water and the only bathroom is a port a potty in the parking lot.",

          "Very interesting story about the history of the Mystery Castle",
          "Needs a lot of care.  Things are becoming worn and falling apart.  Parking lot is rough and not accessible for anyone with a disability.  Castle rooms are small so if going with a group on a tour maybe uncomfortable.  No public restrooms, except for porta potty in parking lot.  Place needs a lot of tlc.",

        "wiki": "Tovrea Castle is a historic structure and landmark in Phoenix, Arizona.  Originally intended as a centerpiece for a resort and later a private residence, the castle is now part of the Phoenix parks system and is designated as one of the Phoenix Points of Pride. Plans were to fully open the site to the public in 2009, but cost overruns delayed the opening. Currently the park shows over 5,000 individual cacti in over 100 different varieties, all maintained by volunteers of the Tovrea Carraro Society. Tickets for guided tours of the grounds, first floor, and basement have been offered since March 2012.\n\n\n== Tovrea Castle at Carraro Heights ==\n\nAlthough the castle had long been recognized as a city landmark, the deteriorated state of the grounds and the building left it unsuitable for use as a city park. After finalizing the purchase of surrounding properties, the City of Phoenix began an effort to restore the building and revitalize the gardens.\nIn 2006, significant work was begun on restoring the gardens surrounding the castle to their previous state. Diseased and dead plants were removed from the site while surviving vegetation was rehabilitated. During restoration efforts, 352 saguaro cacti were planted on the site and over 2,000 other cacti were relocated. Other vegetation, including desert wildflowers were planted in the gardens. Currently the park boasts over 5,000 individual cacti in over 100 different varieties.\nTovrea Castle at Carraro Heights is named in honor of the original builder, Alessio Carraro, and its second owners, E. A. and Della Tovrea.  An interpretive trail exhibiting the gardens and the many desert species, as well as a greenhouse, is planned for the park.\nAfter many delays, the City of Phoenix finally completed the project by Arizona's centennial on February 14, 2012, including a visitor's center open to the public. Tovrea Carraro Society, a local non profit organization formed to operate the site, in partnership with the City of Phoenix, has been conducting guided tours of the grounds, first floor, and basement since March 2012.\n\n\n== Castle characteristics ==\nThe Tovrea Castle is a pine wood and stucco building constructed in a unique three-tier fashion bearing a strong resemblance to a traditional wedding cake, and as such has earned it the local nickname \"The Wedding Cake.\"  The castle has historically eclectic and romanticized European architectural influences including parapets surrounding the roofline of each tier. In addition, the castle is lit during the night by LED and incandescent light bulbs distributed along the roofs and fences.\nThe castle is highly visible from surrounding areas, and in particular drivers on Loop 202 are offered an excellent view of the site.

      "name": "Rosson House Museum at Heritage Square",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Rosson House serves as a historic house museum located in Phoenix's Heritage Square. It was built between 1894 and 1895 and still sits in its original foundation in downtown Phoenix. Named for Dr. Roland Lee Rosson and his wife Flora Murray Rosson, the house changed hands numerous times before being purchased by the City of Phoenix and restored to its original condition.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThis house is in the Stick-Eastlake Queen Anne Style of Victorian architecture. According to 19th century newspaper articles, it was designed by prominent San Francisco architect A.P. Petit.  It would be his last house, as Petit died in the month of its completion.  Controversy exists over the uniqueness of the design, since near exact plans for the house can be found in literature published prior, namely Design #1 as found in George Franklin Barber's Cottage Souvenir #2. The architecture displays numerous attributes contributed from different cultures, such as an Asian moon gate, Italianate hooded windows, and a French octagonal turret.\n\n\n== History ==\nDr. Roland Rosson came to Phoenix in 1879 where he established himself as a general physician and surgeon. Rosson practiced medicine on and off in Phoenix from 1879 until 1897. In addition to his career as a physician, Rosson was also involved in politics. In 1882 he was listed on the Democratic primary ticket. In 1884 he was elected Maricopa County coroner and public administrator. In 1890 he won the office of county treasurer.  In 1892 he was elected for a second term and later unsuccessfully attempted to secure the Democratic nomination for sheriff. On May 7, 1895, Rosson was elected Mayor of Phoenix. He served as a Democrat in this unpaid position along with four Republican councilmen. Rosson's position as mayor was short lived. After difficulties with the city council, he resigned his office on April 6, 1896, before his term was over. Rosson appears to have stayed active in the political scene in Phoenix and his name appears in multiple issues of The Arizona Republican newspaper.Roland Rosson married Flora B. Murray in Phoenix on August 11, 1880.  The Rossons had a total of seven children - Irene, Vivien, Floy, Norma, and Clyde lived to adulthood. Their two other children died in infancy \u2013 their first son Roland Lloyd died at age five weeks, and an unnamed daughter died at birth.\nIn May 1882, the Rossons purchased Block 14 (now Heritage Square) in Phoenix, from Flora's half-sister, Margaret A. Richardson and her husband Mark P. Richardson for $1000.  A newspaper article indicates that the Rossons spent $275 improving their residence in 1882, however the location of the residence is not noted. Prior to the construction of the Rosson House, it is likely that the Rossons lived on Block 14 in an adobe house. Sanborn maps indicate that the house was probably just south of the new house location.In September 1894, several articles appeared in local papers requesting bids for a house designed by architect A.P. Petit for R.L. Rosson at the corner of Monroe and 6th Streets. Late in September, another article lists the bids on the house, including a bid of $7,525 from George E. Cisney who became the contractor for the house. By December a newspaper article indicates that the house was near completion.In February 1895, an article in the Arizona Republican discussing the northeastern part of Phoenix notes that \"The most expensive homes in the city \u2013 the Churchill, the Rosson, the Jacobs, the Murray and the Hine residences are in the immediate locality.\" March 16, 1895 is the first appearance of an ad for Dr. Rosson's office and residence listing the location as the corner of Monroe and Sixth streets.The Rosson House was built with modern accommodations such as electric lights, hot and cold running water, an indoor upstairs bathroom, and a telephone. Other contemporary Victorian mansions on Monroe were similarly equipped - by 1892, Phoenix boasted electrical plants, a domestic water system, a gas system, and two competing telephone companies. The Phoenix street-car line ran down Monroe before turning north on Seventh Street, so the Rossons and other Monroe Street residents had only to walk out to board it.\nThe Rossons continued to own the home and the remainder of Block 14. However, during the winter of 1895-1896 and 1896-1897, the Rosson family rented their home to Whitelaw Reid, an influential Republican and head of the New York Tribune newspaper. No sources indicate where the Rosson family resided during that time. Reid had a lung condition and his doctors recommended he travel to Arizona for his health. The Reid family arrived at the Rosson House in November 1895, where he followed an open-air regimen.  The Tribune was run from Phoenix by typed letters and telegraphs. Reid's letters are an excellent primary source about the early Rosson House and life in Phoenix at the time. He also wrote editorials for papers like the Los Angeles Herald in which he advertised the benefits of Arizona and Phoenix. In 1896, the Reids rented both the Rosson House and Jerry Millay's nearby house.\n\nIn June 1897, the Rossons sold their house and the north half of Block 14. The family moved to Los Angeles, California by July 27 of 1897. The exact reasons for their move are unknown. Newspaper accounts suggest that the Rossons may have had financial difficulties. According to delinquent tax records listed in the newspapers in 1896 and 1897, both Roland and Flora owed back taxes.  Renting their newly constructed house to Whitelaw Reid also suggests that the Rossons needed additional income. The family may also have moved for other reasons. Rosson's obituary in 1898 states that \"\u2026he removed with his family to Los Angeles on account of the educational advantages.\"Little is known about Dr. Rosson's brief time in Los Angeles. On May 12, 1898, after an illness of several weeks, Dr. Rosson died. Initially, his death was considered suspicious and possibly a suicide. Shortly before his death, Rosson had purchased life insurance from several different companies. An autopsy and subsequent coroner's jury in Los Angeles ruled the death to be a result of gastroenteritis. Little else is known of Flora's life. She died in Los Angeles from \"tubercular laryngitis\" at age fifty-two on September 9, 1911.  Her death certificate listed her occupation as \"household duties.\"\n\n\n== Other Owners of the Rosson House ==\nOn June 3, 1897, Aaron Goldberg and his wife, Carrie, purchased the house and north half of Block 14 from the Rossons for $10,000. Aaron and Carrie Goldberg were a prominent Jewish couple in Phoenix. Aaron co-owned Goldberg's clothing store and was also engaged in political and civic activities.  A member of the 19th and 20th Territorial Legislature, Goldberg wrote the bill that permanently located the capitol in Phoenix. He also served on the Phoenix City Council, the Board of Trade, and the Capitol Commission.The Goldberg children included Hazel, Selma and Chester (Chet), who, according to his obituary, was born in the Rosson House.On September 7, 1904, the Goldbergs sold the house and property to \"S.W.\" Higley. Steven W. Higley started out as a railroad builder, became a land owner and later was a partner in the Arizona Republican newspaper. Higley lived in the Rosson House with wife Jessie Freemont Howe, sons Thomas and James, as well as his daughter Jessie Jean. Later, both Thomas and James served in World War I. James died on the battlefield and Thomas returned home and went on to open Tom's Tavern in Phoenix. Jessie Jean went on to marry E. B. Lane. Much of the information known about the Higley family comes from several interviews conducted with daughter Jessie Jean Lane in the 1970s.The Higleys sold the Rosson House and portions of the larger lot to the Gammel family on August 22, 1914. The Gammel family owned and lived in the Rosson House longer than any other family.  Earlier, William Gammel had been a gambler in Jerome, Arizona. In 1904, he married Francis Christopher, a Hispanic woman from Tucson. The couple had 3 daughters \u2013 Annie (b. 1906), Wilma (b. 1908), and Atlanta Georgia (b.1909). Gammel was a co-owner of the Capitol Saloon at 28-30 E. Washington.  Shortly after buying the Rosson House, Prohibition became law in Arizona and it hurt Gammel's business.  In the 1916 Phoenix City Directory, his business was called the Capitol Buffet and sold soft drinks.  In 1919, Gammel was listed as an orange grower, and two years later, the Phoenix City Directory said Mrs. Frankie Gammel had furnished rooms available (in the Rosson House).The Gammel family lived in the Rosson House until 1948 and ran a rooming/boarding house. To make the house better for renters, the Gammels made drastic changes to the house including walling in porches, subdividing floors and adding multiple kitchens and bathrooms. After 1948, the Rosson House changed hands multiple times and continued to operate as a rooming house, eventually becoming a \"flop house\" and falling into disrepair.\nThe City of Phoenix purchased the Rosson House and the remainder of Block 14 in 1974. The Rosson House was restored through a community effort involving the City of Phoenix, dozens of local institutions and hundreds of volunteers.\n\n\n== Other brick landmarks ==\nThe Rosson House is an early example, though not the first, of a house in Phoenix constructed of fired brick and wood instead of adobe bricks. Brick was Petit's preferred building material. At least one local brick-making factory had previously been established, and some fine examples of early brick houses that predate the Rosson House include the mansion built in 1887 for John T. Dennis at 242 E. Monroe and its neighbor at 230 E. Monroe built for M. Jacobs. The John T. Dennis mansion was demolished in the 1950s. Additionally, there was the large house built for Columbus Gray in 1890, and the J.Y.T. Smith House at 5th St. and Adams reportedly dates from 1892.  Almost all of the early hotels of Phoenix were made out of locally produced red bricks as well.\nA number of smaller homes were built outside the city limits in the 1880s by J.J. Welty, and made out of poured concrete blocks made to look like hewn stone. There is also the mansion built by John T. Dennis' neighbor Clark Churchill which later became the first home of Phoenix Union High School.\n\n\n== Access ==\nHeritage Square Foundation and Guild operates the restored Rosson House as a historic house museum in the city of Phoenix Heritage and Science Park and offers public tours.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHistoric Heritage Square (c) 2013 by Donna J.

          "In a city without much visible history this is a great place to visit and tour. The guide not only does a great job describing the house itself but also gives you a glimpse at life in Phoenix in the 1800's. Well worth the time to visit.",
          "This old house and museum show how life was in the early days of Phoenix. The guided tour gives an insight into the lives of the family\u2019s who lived there and how the area fell from grace in later years. It is great that they saved the area from demolition and preserved this",

        "wiki": "The Phoenix Mountains are a mountain range located in central Phoenix, Arizona. With the exception of Mummy Mountain, they are part of the Phoenix Mountain Preserve. They serve as a municipal park and offer hiking, mountain biking and equestrian trails at a variety of different access points.\n\n\n== Peaks ==\nThe major peaks of the Phoenix Mountain complex are:\n\n \nMoon Mountain\nLookout Mountain\nShadow Mountain\nShaw Butte\nNorth Mountain\nEcho Mountain\nStoney Mountain\nSouth Mountain\nPiestewa Peak (formerly named Squaw Peak)\nMummy Mountain\nCamelback Mountain\nSunnyslope Mountain\n\n\n== Other features ==\n  \nThe mountains contain the Phoenix Mountain Preserve which includes the Dreamy Draw Recreation Area, Lookout Mountain Preserve, North Mountain Preserve and Piestewa Mountain Park.\nThe Dreamy Draw Recreation Area is located in the pass between the Stoney/Echo mountain ridge and Piestewa Peak known as Dreamy Draw. The name originated from the neurological effects suffered by miners who worked the area's cinnabar (mercury sulfide) mine. There is a flood prevention dam in the Dreamy Draw area.\n\n\n== Trails ==\n\n\n=== Charles M. Christiansen Memorial Trail ===\n\nThe trail was dedicated in 1986 to Charles Milo Christiansen, the former director of Phoenix Parks and Recreation who led efforts to preserve the Phoenix Mountains. There is a memorial plaque at the western trailhead at Mountain View Park. The trail is 10.7 miles (17.2 km) long and has a total elevation gain of 200', though the elevations at both trailheads are the same. It connects North Mountain Park with Stony Mountain and Piestewa Peak Park.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMap of mountains in the Phoenix area",

          "I have lived in Phoenix my entire life and have never really given much thought about the Phoenix Mountains Preserve. Well, that has changed! I hiked to Piestewa Peak, and wow, was it beautiful! It was also a very good workout! I can't believe the amount of hiking that is",
          "The Quartz Ridge hike was only one hour, and we really enjoyed it. The path was covered with fist sized rocks. The elevation change was just under 200\u2019, so could be a challenge. Lots of hikers, but not crowded. Very limited parking. The local mall has signs that say they tow",
          "We did the 304 trail and it was a easy enough trail. Having just come into Phoenix, we did Camelback yesterday so I was a little stiff and sore but wanted to take in some trails. The 304 was perfect.",
          "We chose a trail near a neighborhood and walked up and down hills and across flat terrain for 2.5 miles. We saw beautiful trees and cacti, many birds, lizards, and a desert rat.",
          "Fairly easy hike around Piestewa Peak. Takes about 2 hours. Some City views and some of distant mountains.",
          "A large mountain area located in central/north central Phoenix, this park is ideal for virtually anyone looking to take a hike/walk in natural desert areas. A multitude of trails go throughout the area, so you can choose how far and how much undulation/elevation you want to take",
          "It\u2019s been several years since I\u2019ve hiked in Phoenix. Proud to say I made it to the top!! And it was beautiful. So close to the city but so into nature. One of my daughter\u2019s friends came and he was telling us all about the plants and different cactus. We took the Mojave trail.",
          "Whether I'm stopping by for a 45 minute hike or want to be on the trail for 1.5, this is my go-to when I'm in PHX for work. It's close to the city and just off the freeway. I recommend parking at Dreamy Draw and checking out the trail maps in order to decide which direction you",
          "This preserve is a jewel, especially due to its location in such a large city. There are a number trails to enjoy without a crowd, but with enough other hikers are around to make it safe.",
          "Lots of options and offshoot trails to choose from. The one I chose was a great time. Not a super hard climb but a beautiful view where you can see into Phoenix for miles.",
          "On a December day it was a nice walk through the preserve. You can see houses and highway on the edges from the well groomed pathways. It was quite crowded on a week day. There a few loops of varying length and difficulty to choose from which are nicely marked along the way.",
          "Glad that I stayed at a nearby resort as I was attending course in the resort. Able to go for multiple desert hiking trails here in the late afternoon. Able to see many birds and rabbits. A great spectacular view if you hike up to the radio station.",

          "I recommend trail #200 for a quick hike to a spectacular view. (20 minutes if you huddle.) You access it from the Mojave parking lot. In Jan/Feb I had luck parking after 11:30am as the morning people are clearing out. And then again after 5:30p. Which gives you just enough",
          "Unknowingly / meaning not planned, we ended up going to Dixie peak / Two bit peak. Being January, the weather was just perfect to do such a hike. Some harder spots, but all in all, it was just a perfect difficulty, especially the peak. \"There is always more\" I said, when we got",
          "This is a wonderful treasure right in the middle of Phoenix! It's well-loved - there weren't many parking places left but we snagged one. I believe the current construction is for new parking areas. That will get cars off the road, maybe, but it also takes out vegetation which",
          "This is a can't miss if you are a bike rider. Trails are well-marked, fairly challenging, yet at points you can get \"lost in the desert\" while actually being only a couple of miles from suburbia. Wonderful.",

          "Very beautiful place. Just be sure to take water with you and pick a path appropriate for your stamina. Also, you might not want to hike anything too difficult when it's 112 degrees. My brother and I attempted to climb Piestewa Peak and neither of us made it because 1) we're not",
          "We loved the preserve !! Great photo shots of the mountains, cactus, and the valley. Take lots of sunscreen, especially If you are going during the summer months. Also, make sure you wear a hat. Its really hot here during the months of July.",
          "I'm not much of a hiker, but this place is absolutely stunning. The views from the base of the trails is amazing, and the further you get up the mountains it just gets better and better. Worth the short detour to see it.",
          "This is a great place to hike and enjoy the Arizona desert and mountains. Great views of Phoenix and the entire valley. DO NOT FORGET TO TAKE ENOUGH WATER.",
          "Hiked here every morning. Go early before it gets too hot. Lots of hills for good exercise. Footing is good. Trails well marked",
          "Awesome views and area. For a novice, it might take a minute to grasp the beauty of the desert but this is a good place to start.",
          "We've hiked this preserve previously, but this was the first time we used the trailhead at 32nd and Lincoln. Very easy to find, and the first mile or so of the trail leaving the parking lot is very manageable. From there it connects to several others that have varying",
          "Good hiking trails with great views of Phoenix. Not quite as green this year as last when there was more rain. Wildlife includes rabbits, quail, ground squirrels, lizards and occasionally a scorpion. Watch your step for occasional \"land mines\", dog owners need to clean up after",
          "Hikes in the Phoenix Mountain Preserve start at moderate level and are well worth it. Views of Phoenix are incredible, landscapes are gorgeous. Ocotillos in bloom were captivating.",
          "Great views! Trails listed as moderate can be challenging, especially on the way down. would recommend you hike with a partner or group of people",
          "We lived a couple miles away from the Visitors center on 7th street and hiked this park 3 -4 times per week. There is a nice variety of trails through the valleys, or up the mountains. North Mountain is a very heavily traveled trail and it seems everyone is just so friendly",
          "Came early on a Sunday morning with a few friends to check out the scenery and do a little birding. Several trails with varying degrees of difficulty. Nice scenery, quiet and very clean, except for the dog droppings. Very tight parking and already full early.",
          "We visited this park on a Saturday in February. The trails are well marked, some steep and suitable for hard trail running, others between gentle packed earth and even quite a bit of paved, wide trails. This area of mountains is typical Sonoran desert and has a diverse and",
          "Next time I come here I\u2019ll walk or run. I couldn\u2019t find parking on a busy Saturday. Tons of great trails and clean and beautiful. Really nice place to come exercise !!",

          "well used and well marked trails for hiking - a desert oasis in an urban landscape - go hiking,,,and bring water!",
          "I was blown away by the great day hikes that I was able to do while I was in Phoenix for a week. Phoenix did a great job to make these mountains accessible.",
          "We asked a local about her favourite hiking area and she shared this one. It ended up being mine as well. We were in Scottsdale so it was a 25 minute drive. It was located at the end of 40th street after you crossed Tatum. There is not a lot of parking but you can park on the",
          "The Phoenix Mountain Preserve is a great place for novices to go hiking. The trails are not steep and the scenery is beautiful. Be sure to take adequate water with you.",
          "This preserve is made up of several different areas and I know that I went to at least two of them: Piestewa and North Mountain. Both areas have parking areas and some signs. However both places need more parking (overflow lots would be nice) and more signs (thought I was going",
          "This area is a good place to hike. There are good trails and lots of scenery. Good for bicycling as well.",
          "Was a nice getaway from the city for a bit. Sad you could still see the city from all angles, but a good hiking and biking place.",
          "My sister and I were looking for a relatively easy, flat hike in the desert. The visitor center here is very helpful and open nearly every day of the year. The hikes range from easy to very difficult. We made a loop out of the 100 & 306 trails for about 2 miles. The maps are",
          "Quieter and not as busy as Squaw Peak and Camelback...and not as challenging. Remember to bring lots of water and wear good trekking shoes and stay away from bushes b/c of snakes. Phoenix has many places for short hikes.",
          "We had a lovely hike here and there are so many areas to park and BBQ or enjoy your lunch on the long tables provided at multiple levels. The hiking here is really lovely and private as there are recreational areas set up like plazas at various tiers. There are long tables and",
          "Small parking lot at the trail head. We parked across the street on a Saturday morning- at the high point of the trail another hiker stated that cars were being towed from that lot... we finished the hike and were fine though it is posted by the Starbucks there that hikers cars",
          "We here for an early morning hike in the summer with a work group. I LOVED the Quartz Ridge Trail hike...I would judge it as Easy but some would say Moderate. Love the views at the end and a must do when hiking in the mountain preserve.",
          "We did the Freedom Loop. It was challenging for the whole family, the 8 and 9 year old as well as the adults. A great hike!",
          "This is a great place for anyone looking for different levels of hiking ability. Climbing to top is a great experience but difficult if youre not in shape. The trails at the base of mountain are much easier and wind through some beautiful scenery.",
          "I hiked North Mountain trail 44. It was amazing with beautiful views. There are a decent amount of people on this trail but that was ok with me. Not being from the area and hiking solo, I wanted some other people around. I loved this so much that I did it twice. The second time",
          "nice driving are to go to. a photographers dream to see and take pictures of the sites. scenic driving through the hills.",
          "So many lovely trails for Spring and winter hikes. The desert is brutal in the summer heat but spring mornings and winter days you will find the great outdoors enjoyable with wildlife and vistas at every turn.",
          "Great place to hike if you enjoy mountainous desert scenery. Never very crowded. Lots of options for challenging or easy hikes. No shade. No facilities. Bring lots of water!",
          "Such a stunning environment and so much contrast in the whole area. Would highly recommend and the people are lovely",
          "What's nice about Phoenix Mountain Preserve is there are trails for all levels of hikers. It is a beautiful spot with nice views. You can bring your dog, too! The great thing about living in this beautiful climate is to be able to get outdoors and enjoy it!",
          "I grew up climbing in, on, and around these rocks on these hills with cacti galore. It's a different world for those who have not had the opportunity to \"be in\" the desert. Close enough so you can do this when you are in Phoenix or Scottsdale during a conference, convention, or",
          "what can you really say.??...a beautiful clean park where you can see the nice views of the city and great desert life. If your up for it physically hike as far up the trail as you can on Squaw peak and th higher you make it the more beautiful of a view of the valley you will be",
          "Spring in AZ is an incredible time to be alive! The desert is beautiful and the views are spectacular. This is completely different than the Desert Garden in town (not to be missed if you have the slightest interest in gardening), but it compliments it well. You get to see",
          "Trails for all ages and types of people. Great scenery and solitude w/o having to leave the city. We went on a Monday afternoon, and we had the trail to ourselves most of the time. Several trail options with varying levels of difficulty.",
          "This is a place to get away. It's close in and convenient, but relatively deserted. Easy non strenuous hiking especially great for running a dog. Be careful of the sun and the rare snake",
          "Many hikes to choose from of varying difficulty. The summit trail is the most crowded. we enjoyed #302 more as it was less populated and was a loop trail.",
          "The trails were great! I found on most of the trails that you rarely ran into anyone, except when on the trail going to the summit, it was a little overcrowded.",
          "What could be better in the middle of a city than a mountain preserve? Pack a picnic, head to the Phoenix Mountain preserve and enjoy nature, a picnic and taking a hike. The smells of the desert, the beautiful desert greenery and critters that call the mountains in this desert",
          "This is our regular choice for easy or longer hikes as well as bike rides. There really are so may to choose from that you should look at a map before going or the map at the trails head at the south end of 40th Street. There is a main hike upwards or more level hikes or bike",
          "I visited Phoenix with my daughters and pup for some winter sun. As avid hikers, we headed for Camelback, only to learn it is not dog friendly. We were advised to go to the Phoenix Mountain Preserve. It was the perfect length hike with wonderful views over the city.",
          "Fantastic little hike right in the city! Beautiful views of the city and other mountains from the top of Two Bits Peak. Lots of people and dogs. Pretty rocky on the trail. Not too hard at the beginning but becomes steep closer to the top. Very nice! Worth a visit!",
          "Took a Ranger guided tour courtesy of the Phoenix Library and learned many aspects of safe hiking in this area, including bringing enough water, walking sticks to keep snakes at bay, etc. There were plenty of opportunities for taking some beautiful photos and the vistas were",
          "I really enjoy walking around in this park. You can hike on the trails or just walk on the paved side walk. It is an awesome place to check out the desert in the city.",
          "Lots of great hiking and biking routes. Pretty well marked. Some of the routes are more challenging than others. They can be a full day or a short one hour back and forth. Check to see which you want to do.",
          "Be sure to visit the visitor center at North Mountain Preserve. A gem in the desert. There is a calendar of events too. There is so much activity here to indulge yourself with....",
          "Took a nice hike to celebrate the new year. I am used to taking long walks around the neighborhood, but the elevation on this hike of almost 600 feet causes a little huffing and puffing. Nevertheless you can walk the nearly one mile up at your own pace and enjoy the vista",
          "My 7 year old son and I climbed some ways up the mountain. We enjoyed it and the experience of being up so high and being able to see miles around us. What an awesome view and experience. Definitely would've gone up higher but couldnt due to bum knee. Could you imagine the",
          "We hiked the Quartz Ridge trail (8A), which was 3.4 m out and back. It took approx. 2 hours but that was mostly due to traffic, picture opportunities, and puppy breaks. Without kids or puppies it could take as little as one hour if you're in good shape. Anyway, it was a lovely",
          "Spent the day winding up one trail and down another; very peaceful. Great views from Shaw Butte and North Mountain.",
          "Gotta be reasonably in shape to ascend Phoenix numerous strange mountains. But well worth the uphill walk to see where the concrete ends... Off beaten paths. The real Phoenix. Everything else is man made & congested.",
          "What a hike! They say it's rated extremely difficult and you know what?? IT IS! We had a great time climbing up the rocks and looking at the amazing view points. What always amazes me about hiking trails like this is the amount of people I see that don't carry water with them.",
          "We visited the Phoenix area for a week and hiked in the Preserve 3 times. An awesome spot to get away from the city to enjoy the outdoors. Good for all ages - we hiked trail 302 with our 7 year old & hiked the Summit 2 with Family. Don't miss this jewel in the desert.",
          "Had myself a great hiking day, amazing weather so needed plenty of water. I did trail #8 which also had an \"a\" and a \"b\" which lead to great views of the city to the west of the mountains. One thing to remember at this time of the year, when the sun goes down, it's dark and",
          "It is close to Scottsdale. Several trails. Not too strenous. Lovely views. Well kept trails. Will go again.",
          "This is one of those places that gives you the true flavor of Phoenix as well as Arizona/ It is well worth the time. The views are stunning.",
          "I have tried several different branch points here and enjoyed them all. Trail number 8, 100, and 8A are all really enjoyable. 8 has a lot more strenuous opportunities, where as 100 is more or less level with much less elevation gain throughout. My pics are from two different",
          "There is good access and parking for Phoenix Mountain Presserve via 24th Street and Lincoln.You get some great views over Phioienix and Scottsdlae and see the mountains beyond. Not quite as diccult as camelback, but tougher that the McDowell's you will get a good work out if you",
          "We went to Phoenix Mountain Preserve. There are nice vista views. There is lots of great trails for hiking. The many covered picnic table areas are also so nice for enjoying a picnic lunch.",
          "If you like to hike, mountain bike, or camp this is a place to visit. Endless trails allow for exploring - justl make sure to bring plenty of water. The views are phenomenal. For out of owners, the early spring or winter months would probably be best as temperatures are very hot",
          "Beautiful views, lots of hiking trails, I bring all of my recycles to the ranger station here.. love it",
          "Make sure to bring plenty of water and a hay! Climb to the summit is fairly steep. The views are fantastic.",
          "I live close to this mountain and it is a great climb when it is not in the summer! Not enough parking ever! Open most of the day! I have gone different times of the day and there are always climbers but more in the late afternoon or early AM!. Great exercise!",
          "Did some sightseeing with Motorcycle. Breathtaking views from the lookouts and very nice cactuses. Remember to reserve enough water.",
          "My wife and I did the Hawk's Nest trail to the Dixie Mountain trail in May. These trails are very well marked and moderately difficult with some decent elevation changes. It was too hot for us to finish the loop so we went out for a while and came back the way we started. The",
          "I drove up to the 32nd st. access on a Sunday morning at 730 to get in a hike before a flight. Not a big parking lot! Those cars lurking near the gate are waiting for a space and will be bitter if you, the out of towner, just drive in and park when someone conveniently pulls",
          "I began hiking Squaw Peak before it became Piestewa. After 15 yrs of climbing the most famous hike in Phoenix, I realized there were dozens of others --both marked and unmarked and I have climbed-hiked all of them too. --The odd thing is, decades before AZ and Phx created parks",
          "Couldn't resist the draw of the Piestewa Peak rising up some 2,612 feet over the Phoenix Moutain Reserve and even though only had my traveling tennis shoes on and not hiking boots it was so well worth it and a just right climb. Not too long...45 minutes to the summit and of",
          "This is an amazing look at the nature of the desert right in the middle of Phoenix! You can spend as much or as little time there as you want. Wear comfortable walking shoes and sunscreen and take lots of water along!!!",
          "We hiked up this mountain early morning and it was nice. There are several different paths you could choose, we took one that was pretty flat for a while and then once it got steeper the bath was paved. It was an easy hike, there were people jogging up it and young kids were",
          "Wonderful scenery and plenty of moderately challenging climbs. I am hoping to move to the Phoenix area and plan on hiking there more often.",
          "We hiked the trails at the end of Squaw Peak Road twice and off 40th street once! The 40th Street entrance had a trail that split off to climb the mountain right there. It was a medium intensity hike. Probably took us 3 or 4 hours round trip, but we did stopped for frequent",
          "Like most of the mountain areas in the Phoenix area this is another beautiful desert park and an interesting are to walk and climb the mountain. There is relatively better parking in this area and it well worth a visit if in the Scottsdale Phoenix area. Spring is ideal as the",
          "We did the summit climb on a Sunday in March and it was very crowded. Which took away from the enjoyment of the hike/climb. I would suggest going during the week if that's an option. The summit climb was great though. Very challenging for an athletic novice. Definitely got me",
          "I set out to climb Piestewa Peak but was derailed from the get-go. I got there at 9:30 on Saturday morning. Bad idea. I thought parking at Cholla Trail for Camelback was bad... this was worse. There aren't nearly enough parking spaces at Phoenix Mountain Preserve, especially",
          "A beautiful oasis in the middle of sprawling Phoenix. Excellent hiking trails, well maintained. Convenient access off highway 51.",
          "I hike in the preserve frequently. A variety of cacti, hawks, doves, quail, rabbits, road runners, coyotes and sometimes rattlesnakes",
          "My husband and I were looking for the perfect hike for our last day in Phoenix, and we found it here! Did the 302/Freedom Trail from near Mojave parking area to the peak (of that particular trail). Our two adventurous kids (ages nine and five) made the almost three-mile trek as",
          "We hiked the Piestewa Peak and loved it. Takes about 1-1.5h to reach the summit and the views throughout are terrific. Definitely bring some water for the hike as the uphill portion in particular is challenging (though not too challenging as my pregnant wife was able to hike it",
          "A little wilderness at the edge of busy north Phoenix area and close to Sun City. Curvy roads, good hiking.",
          "Beautiful trails and not as crowded as some other popular hiking spots. Bring more water than you think you will need. Never hike alone.",
          "What a surprise to see this part of the mountain chain listed. I grew up in this neighborhood! Nearly year around, we would climb mountains every day, just for something to do in the 60's and 70's. Nice trails, great view. Not sure where you would park for this, probably along",

There are nice views of the city when you make your way up, and close to Cheryl Dr you you can see a tiny man-made labyrinth of about 3 feet time 3 feet, after you walk about a quarter mile upon entering the trail.\nThe trails do get busy since they are right in the middle of the city.",

          "I\u2019m an AZ native and love the trails in this mountain preserve more than Camelback Mountain. The views are absolutely stunning. The Summit trail is a very difficult trail and most popular so if you\u2019re looking for a great workout, I would do \u2026",
          "Rocks, cactus and plants. Some people wondering around from time to time. Most appear to be outside of their natural habitat, especially on the weekends. I'd go back if they put in an escalator like the city council had promised.",

          "Had a terrific introductory hike to the top of one of these hills. Gorgeous topography and excellent scenery. Nice trails. I also took an ill advised night hike, and it was spectacular!",
          "As far as mountains go. It was tall, like most mountains are. But I also liked that there were cacti as well. There were several different sizes of rocks there. They were also different colors. Therefore I felt the mountain was all inclusive.",
          "I run this trail practically every other day.  It is a short yet challenging trail that is easily accessable by any vehicle.  The only things I would say I do not like about this trail are the people.  It is often crowded, some \u2026",
          "It's a great place to just go and clear your thoughts. You can also challenge yourself as well. I bring my dog when I visit the preserves so I can't test my ultimate limits but that's ok. There are plenty of other challenges besides going \u2026",
          "I grew up in Phoenix hiking the mountain preserves.  Still love honking them but don't get to as often as I wish. Close, easy access, clean and awesome outdoor diversion right in the middle of the city.",

          "One of my all time favorite hikes. It's a steep climb to the top, but the view is totally worth it! You get a perfect panoramic view of the Phoenix area. You will want to be in a moderate health condition to hike this, but if you take your time, you'll be fine.",
          "Papago is beautiful place to hike",

          "Blessed to have access to the beautiful AZ wilderness... so much to see!",

          "Piestewa Peak was an excellent hike with a great view at the end. After doing Camelback Mountain it wasn't quite as impressive, but still a rewarding hike.",
          "We're from out-of-state and wanted a nice hike before flying back home. Popular place especially for dogs. Parking is a challenge and the ranger was ticketing cars in \"no parking\" areas. Plenty of marked and unmarked trails, but labels were often missing/confusing. Trails range from paved/easy to loose stone/difficult.",

          "Great trail network! \nAscending to the peak of Piestewa Peak was incredible. Bring water and pace yourself. I ran/hiked to the top in about 25 minutes and back down in about 35 minutes. If you\u2019re hiking the whole way plan for a couple of hours.",
          "Lots of great trails to hike. Its a gift to have a place like this in the middle of a major city. Views of downtown at night/ sunset are amazing.",

          "Beautiful area with miles of hiking trails and great views of the valley. You can access the park from  North Tatum ,  Lincoln , Shea, or the 51 freeway. The trails starting from those four locations all converge at the center of the park \u2026",

          "Beautiful area with lots of places to Hike.",

          "It's a cool place to wander around for an hour or so. The best part: varied terrain and plant life just outside downtown Phoenix. But much if the landscape looks the same and is very close to the highway.",
          "Unknowingly / meaning not planned, we ended up going to Dixie peak / Two bit peak. Being January, the weather was just perfect to do such a hike. Some harder spots, but all in all, it was just a perfect difficulty, especially the peak. \u2026",

We didn't make it all the way to the top because someone coming down said the last 200' was sheer rock. No dogs on the trail.",
          "Dreamy draw trail is a favourite of ours even though the trail signs are worn or missing. We cannot seem to follow a trail from beginning to end with ending on a different trail.  The summer rains have made a couple of trails roughed up and more rugged. Some places feel too close to hwy 51.",

          "Unknowingly / meaning not planned, we ended up going to Dixie peak / Two bit peak. Being January, the weather was just perfect to do such a hike. Some harder spots, but all in all, it was just a perfect difficulty, especially the peak. \u2026",
          "This is a beautiful place to hike right in the city.  Pick a easy trail and take the kids or choose a difficult trail and get a workout.",
          "A hike not meant for the faint of heart. Im kidding but in all reality please don't take young children further up the trail. The bottom half is good for people of all ages whilst the upper half is great for experienced hikers.",

          "Loved the hiking trails, especially in the winter when you don\u2019t have to battle the heat. The trail is slightly difficult, but the view you get at the end of the trail is worth it. Make sure to bring plenty of water and drink it sparingly on your way!",
          "Well the staff is terrible....wait, it isn't a restaurant. That explains a lot! If u need a review of this place, don't go. It has nature in a natural setting.",

          "This is a great place within the city to get away and take a hike. It can get busy at times but all the people on the trails are nice and many stop to say hello and see how you are doing. If you haven't visited this place yet then put it on your to do list because the trails and the views are wonderful!",
          "Piestawa is a killer hike! Hitting the summit is quite the leg workout. It's like melted stairs the whole way up! Amazing views up top and lots of rock climbing opportunities. There's lots of beautiful rock structures. We also found 2 chuckwallas!",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Piestewa Peak ( py-ES-t\u0259-wah; O'odham: Vainom Do'ag, formerly Squaw Peak), at 2,610 feet (796 m) is the second highest point in the Phoenix Mountains, after Camelback Mountain, and the third highest in the city of Phoenix, Arizona.  It is located in the Piestewa Peak Recreation Area within the Phoenix Mountain Preserve, near Piestewa Parkway (Arizona State Highway 51). Piestewa Peak is named in honor of Army Spc. Lori Ann Piestewa, the first known Native American woman to die in combat in the U.S. military, and the first female soldier to be killed in action in the 2003 Iraq War.\n\n\n== Name ==\nSince at least 1910, the name Squaw Peak had been used in reference to the mountain. Other historic names included Squaw Tit Mountain, Phoenix Mountain and Vainom Do'ag, the Pima name for the mountain. As the term \"squaw\" is considered derogatory by some, numerous efforts to change the name of the mountain were made through the years. State Representative Jack Jackson, himself a Navajo, submitted a bill to change the name annually beginning in 1992, which generated repeated and often raw debates in Arizona.  In 1997, the local youth group of the American Indian Movement, which filed a petition with the State Board on Geographic and Historic Names in 1997 to change the name to Iron Mountain, the English translation of the mountain's native Pima name.  The board researched the issue for nearly a year before ruling in July 1998 that too much doubt existed as to whether the name Vainom Do'ag actually referred to the mountain in question or another nearby peak and the petition was rejected, although the board left the door open to alternative possible name-changes.U.S. Board on Geographic Names policy is to consider changes to features using the word \"squaw\" when approved by local authorities, but petitioners are strongly urged to choose new names that relate to Native American women and/or culture.  In 2003, newly elected Governor Janet Napolitano petitioned the state board to rename the mountain for Lori Piestewa.  The Governor's lobbying, while ultimately successful, proved to be controversial.  The controversy stemmed in part from the fact that governor's request violated a required waiting period of five years after a person's death prior to renaming a geographic feature; Piestewa had been killed earlier that year while deployed on active military duty in Iraq.  Tim Norton, a Phoenix police officer who at the time was serving as the director of the Arizona State Board on Geographic and Historic Names, refused to place the request on the board's agenda, citing the five-year requirement.  Mario Diaz, an aide to Napolitano, subsequently contacted Norton's supervisor with the police department in an attempt to pressure Norton into changing his mind, but the supervisor refused, stating it was not a police department issue and was outside of his authority.  Diaz' actions were picked up on by the press and resulted in strong criticism from both the public sector as well as fellow politicians, with some politicians considering a formal inquiry.  Napolitano herself publicly admonished Diaz, but the controversy dogged Napolitano during her reelection campaign and throughout her tenure as governor.The state board, absent its director, approved the name change to Piestewa Peak on April 17, 2003, less than a month after Piestewa's death.  The U.S. Board on Geographic Names, however, refused to accept a similar petition at the time, citing their own five-year waiting rule.  Five years later the board agreed to review the request as the waiting period had passed.  The board also considered other potential alternatives, including Swilling Peak for area pioneer Jack Swilling.  Ultimately, the national board voted 11\u20132 to approve the name change to Piestewa Peak, while indicating that the original name of Squaw Peak might still be used in publications as a secondary reference.\n\n\n== Natural history ==\n\nAs a landform, Piestewa Peak is relatively young, formed roughly 14 million years ago. However, it is composed of much older rock, primarily schist.Flora in this area is typical of the lower Sonoran Desert and includes almost all varieties of Arizona cactus such as saguaro, barrel, hedgehog, pincushion, jumping cholla and prickly pear. Trees and colorful shrubbery include palo verde, mesquite, ironwood trees, creosote (dominate), ocotillo, brittle bush, desert lavender and giant sage shrubs.Wildflowers are abundant in the early spring and include Mexican gold poppies (deep yellow), brittlebush (yellow), lupine (purples), desert globemallow (orange) and scorpionweed (purple). Fiddleneck and bladderpod also are blooming in some areas. These are in addition to the many varieties of flowering cacti.Many species of reptiles thrive in the preserve, including gila monster, horned lizard, chuckwalla, and western diamondback rattlesnake. The mammal population includes coyote, bobcat, jackrabbit, cottontail rabbit, ground squirrel and kit fox. There are several species of birds that inhabit the preserve, including turkey vultures, mockingbirds, cactus wrens, Gambel's quail and several species of owls and hawks.\n\n\n== Hiking ==\n\nThe Piestewa Peak Summit Trail (elevation gain = 1,208 feet (368 m) in 1.2 miles (1.9 km)) is climbed thousands of times per week by locals and visitors seeking a cardio-vascular workout, great views, or a family outing. However, quite a few hikers do not actually reach the top due to the fact that this trail is more difficult than it looks, especially in the summer when temperatures are well over 100 \u00b0F (40 \u00b0C). No water is available on the trail and dehydration is a common and serious problem with hikers who come unprepared. Water is only available at the trailhead, and at several ramadas along squaw peak road, uphill from the summit trail parking lot. Views from the summit include, in clear weather, Pinnacle Peak, the McDowell Mountains, Four Peaks, the Superstition Mountains, Tabletop Mountain, the Sierra Estrella, Woolsey Peak, the White Tank Mountains, the Harquahala Mountains, the Papago Mountains, the Hieroglyphic Mountains, and the Bradshaw Mountains.\nThe hike itself takes anywhere from 25 to 60 minutes in fair weather,  depending on each hiker's capabilities (higher temperatures and sunny conditions may force the hiker to take up to twice as long). A beginning hiker should allow 60 minutes for a leisurely ascent and 40 for descent.  The path is mostly well marked. There are 4 spots that are confusing and hikers who are not familiar with the path will be forced to look around for the designated route. There are a few sections that are technically difficult as they are steep and there are no guard rails.\nThere are approximately fifteen miles of interconnecting trails in the Preserve, ranging from easy to difficult. There are several differences in regulation between the Piestewa Peak summit trail and the rest of the interconnected Phoenix mountain preserve trail system. The greater trail system allows horseback riding, biking, and foot traffic, including dogs. Piestewa peak summit trail allows foot traffic only: no bicycles, dogs, or horses. The greater trail system is generally open to the public from sunrise to sunset. Piestewa peak (summit trail only) is open from sunrise until 11:00 PM. This unique late availability combined with proximity to city lights, and a light-colored rock translates to a popular location for night hikes.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSquaw Peak Inn\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoenix Mountains Preserve, satellite images\nPiestewa Peak pictures and hiking information",

          "Definitely not a simple hike, go early in the day before it gets too hot. It\u2019s an intense hike but take it at your own pace and it\u2019ll be fine. Really amazing views. Much easier than camelback",
          "Loved this hike. Medium range difficulty. 2 hrs total. Come early to find parking. Or you can also Uber/Lyft in and out. Carry atleast 2 bottles of water each to the peak. It is pretty dry and you feel thirsty quickly. Also there are sort of 2 peaks on the top close to each",
          "A great hike with a fantastic view from the top you will definitely need good hiking shoes to navigate the tough rocky trail. If you are ok with a fairly long and difficult hike, this is definitely the number 1 place to go, bring LOTS of water.",

          "We got there around 9 and waited about 10 min. for a parking spot. But we planned on that and used the time to apply sunscreen. I would suggest this hike for those who consider themselves athletic. There were many people we watched go part way and then have to turn around",
          "A very strenuous hike up the side of what was previously known as Squaw Peak. Parking is hard to find, but there are unbeatable views of the valley from the top. Be sure to be well prepared with a bottle of water for going up and a second one for coming down. It takes about",
          "This was a fun adventure for our family. Be sure to bring plenty of water and shoes with good traction. We made it to the summit and found it to be a fun challenge. It was hard work, but definitely worth it. Don\u2019t forget your camera!",

          "We love to spend time outdoors but want to just \"meander\" This is a great place for both the serious hiker and the more casual hiker. It is easy to just stroll and enjoy the outdoors while looking at the landscape. Don't let the beautiful blue sky fool you in February, take a",

          "The Summit Trail hike is a challenge...I believe it is rated a 'double black diamond'. Make sure you have plenty of water and hiking shoes with good traction, as this is not a stroll in the park and in many areas, you will be climbing...not just walking. There are several",

          "I've hiked Camelback and South Mountain - Kiwanis trail and this by fast was the most strenous straight up hike. Camelback was longer but it wood go straight up then level off for a bit. This trail is straight up the whole way. What a view after sunset too... stunning. A",
          "I hike all over the valley but had not hiked Piestewa. I did so on Thanksgiving. What a hike! It was crowded but it was a phenomenal experience. I loved the workout and the view of the valley was exceptional. Take time to hike Piestewa if you haven't, and if you have then,",
          "This one is a tough hike, but well worth it. While the mileage is fairly low, most of it is stair-like, which can be hard on the legs. It may seem like going up is the toughest, but actually, coming down seems to be worse because your fatigued already. Definitely recommend",
          "I loved this hike. Great views of the city. It was challenging, but not too bad. It took about 60-70 min to hit the top.",
          "This is a double black diamond, so if you're new to hiking, I recommend taking it really slow are starting with an easier climb. The views are spectacular and I recommend going at dusk so you can see the night view down to Temp, It's pretty breathtaking",
          "The challenge was exhilarating to say the least. I am afraid of heights but the gradual trail and manageable grade made the walk fun. It can be overcrowded at times but the people hiking up and down were jovial to say the least. We enjoyed the hike and my legs are now. Big sore",
          "I have been climbing this mountain, which is located near my residence, for almost 40 years. It\u2019s good exercise, but not overly difficult. There is a path all the way to the top. The views of Phoenix and Scottsdale are excellent. While it is steep in a few places it is not",

          "Our concierge, Michael from Hilton Pointe Sqaw Peak recommended these trails right behind our hotel and they were exactly what we were looking for. Challenging yet easy enough for me and my sister and nephews to climb while visiting Phoenix, AZ and not be overwhelmed. Great",

          "Climbing this peak is a challenging but manageable hike; very busy on weekends especially early mornings. I\u2019d recommend a very early start in order to get a parking spot. Trails are not only well-marked but are practically a vertical sidewalk. People are friendly and",
          "While the peak seems daunting my wife and i hiked this with our 5 month old in tow. It wasn't as bad as expected and the views are great.",
          "Lots of trails and beautiful scenery. You can bring your dog, just not on the summit trail. They must be leashed on the other trails. It's a great view of Phoenix and the trails are well kept.",
          "If you haven\u2019t hiked Piestewa (formerly Squaw) Peak, you haven\u2019t hiked Phoenix.

You will see lots of people and lots of great desert and urban views",

          "This was a tough trail with an intense climb. If you are not a hiker/climber plan on it taking you at least an hour o get to the top. Bring water and go at a pace you can sustain. Don't be intimidated by the locals who use it to train 3 days a week so they get to the top in",

          "So everyone must climb one peak \"within\" Phoenix itself. Piestewa is easy to drive to, easy to park, and pleasant to walk up. It is steep, so you need to be in shape. That said, the path is excellent, and the views from the top amazing. If it's hot, take plenty of water.",

          "The hike to Piestewa Peak while we were in the Phoenix area was one of the highlights of our trip. Good hiking shoes are a must if you want to get to the top. The view at the top was well worth the hike. Don't forget to bring water!",

          "We've hiked this trail many times but over the last few years it's become less and less desirable. The use of hiking trails for workouts is very inconsiderate. Having people speed by in both directions is distracting and forces one to constantly change pace, and stop. I really",
          "A nice walk up the mountain, or run if you like. Great views all around of the Phoenix area. But watch those hot days and bring plenty of water when you go. Stay on the trails. A few explorers have spent hours waiting for help while dangling from a small ledge after falling",

          "I took this hike in January of this year. I would rate this hard, but not so hard that it can't be done by someone of an average fitness level. It was harder than I thought for me but I blame the holidays for that. I gotta admit I was a bit out of shape. I would recommend doing",

          "This is a great park for the casual and intense hike. I like parking at the last lot, then taking it easy on the downhill to the main path. From there, you have options to head up the peak or keep it nice and easy. I recommend coming early morning or late evening to avoid the",
          "This was once a great run to the top and down, but I understand they've made steps and paved a lot of it. That's a shame. Still a good view tho.",

          "This is usually not a busy place to hike and there are multiple pavilions to have a get together or picnic. Please be advised that if you're not from the area, DO NOT hike in the extreme heat. You are not accustomed to the weather as much as you may think you can handle it.",
          "This isn't really a \"hike.\" It's 1.1 miles up to a summit. Depending on how fast you take it, it's a good cardio workout on the way up. Not terribly scenic, but better than the gym. At the top there are rockchucks galore that will eat apple pieces from your hand and stand on",
          "Great hike to peak. Challenging . At times narrow ledges to climb. Very much like stair climbing up a tall building. Should be in reasonable shape. Bring water!!! Teen will love the challenge. Should take no more that hour and a half to top wwith rest stops. Great view of entire",

          "A beautiful park with hiking trails and low scrub areas that make for an easy walk. The view is lovely from the park's entrance. You can see over the city of Phoenix all the way to South Mountain. The path is a little steep, but if you just want to stay on the lower level,",

          "I've been hiking the former \"Squaw\" since I was a kid, and it never gets old. The view of the city is fantastic, especially at night. The only cost associated is the sore calves you'll most likely have the next day. Be warned - this is not for the out of shape - this is a steep",
          "It's supposed to be an easy hike, but definitely for a klutz like me. I did make it about two thirds of the way up with the other women in my group, as the men made it all the way to the top. There are plenty of great views along the way. I ended up falling on the way down",

          "I have hike Piestewa a number of times, and have always found it very easy. It's basically a giant set of stairs winding up toward the peak. Piestewa is a nice hike for people who want to hike for fitness, rather than to go off exploring. It tends to have a small crowd, and can",
          "We had a nice time doing the hike here on the \"Freedom Trail\" -- I believe it was rated as a moderate hike. The one word of caution -- and the reason I downgraded the review from \"very good\" to \"average\" -- is that the parking was horrendous. Granted, it was a Saturday of Easter",

          "This is less about a challenging hike as it it felt more like a repetitive climb of steps of various heights. No where near as cool as Camelback nor Tom Thumb. It's a city hill with city traffic. This may be great for the daily exerciser but not a hike I would recommend for a",

          "I have been hiking here for more decades than I care to admit. When I was in my 20's I would hike up and down the mountain 3 times to get in shape for other hikes. Now once is enough. I love the view at sunset. God willing, I will be making this hike for years to come.",
          "The view was worth the hike up the mountain. very crowded and parking is difficult but worth the time. REMINDER..... bring water!!",
          "My husband and I decided to hike a trail and saw that everyone was hiking the Piestewa Summit. It's only 1.2 miles (one-way), how bad could it be? This is a VERY popular trail and you will see newbies (like us), those who \"run\" the hike and everyone else in between and of all",
          "I went quite early in the day so had no car parking problems as has been suggested may happen by other reviews. Even so there was still a lot of people on the path, so clearly the hike to the top, or part way up, is very popular. Busy in places but folks are polite and slower",

          "If you are up for a challenging walk, take the 1.2 mile hike up to the top of Squaw Peak(aka Piestewa Peak Park). Take the Summit trail... it takes about 60-90minutes to the top and the same back down. Breathtaking views for 360* and just stunning. This is a popular trail, so be",

          "EXCELLENT CHOICE when deciding WHAT TO DO while in PHX! I found this on hikeSquawPeak dot com which was full of PICTURES and INFO. I needed (excellently done site by the way!) For EVERYONE, friends, family or by yourself...the hike and the hikers were VERY FREINDLY which made",
          "This was quite steep, we almost turned back a couple of times, but the view from the top was amazing! We were inexperienced and it took us 2 1/2 hours round trip. Take water and have shoes with traction.",
          "A great stop for local and visiting hikers OR if you want a solid workout. Who needs a stair stepper when you can step your way up to one of the best views in the Valley of the Sun. Parking is adequate. Bring water if you are going to hike later in the day in the hot sun",
          "Maybe if you are a frequent hiker this peak is a piece of cake but for the rest of us...wow! Woke up the next morning sore from places I didn't know I could even be sore from! Overall it had beautiful scenery and plant life. Been back several times and have always encountered",
          "Pros: nice hike close to downtown, makes you test your physical endurance if you make it in 25min to the peak. Cons: very popular and always crowded on the trail, difficult to park",
          "This takes about an hour to get to the top. A bit less than nearby Phoenix standby Camelback Mountain, but close enough. Great exercise, and a very nice view. What more can you want?",
          "The climb to the summit was exhilarating and exhausting at the same time. The views from the top are stunning looking out over the city. We were there on a weekend and there were a lot of people there too many in fact. would go during week if possible",
          "It can get pretty busy at the center, so plan for some time to park. The hike to the top of the peak is pretty great. Because it is well traveled it is pretty safe. Please take necessary precautions while hiking: plenty of sun block, hat, cover exposed skin, and drink water.",
          "Hiked here with my two boys, 7 and 8. It was a nice climb up a well maintained trail. About two hours round trip. My 8 year old athletic son could have ran up it, but my 7 year old started to break down mentally just before the summit. We ended up making it up after a little",
          "I like to hike here as it is not as steep as the Camelback. My daughter was five when she first made it to the top. At that time it took her 60 mins one way but she did it in 40 mins today. This summit course was my fall back plan whenever I couldn't find a parking at the",
          "This is a beautiful park with excellent hiking and great views, right in the city of Phoenix, but the trails are not well-marked and there are numerous side trails and paths which make it too easy to get off the intended trail. Be sure to take a trail map. The Freedom Trail is",
          "Just a few miles up an urban street from the posh Biltmore District is a total wilderness that you can lose the city in. It takes me less than ten minutes to leave the busy intersections and stores of Camelback Road and 24th Street, and be on a mountain surrounded by Saguaro",
          "I did both this hike and camelback, and while I thought the camelback hike itself was more enjoyable and challenging, I enjoyed the views from the summit at piestewa more. Use the trip advisor app and it will navigate you directly into the parking lot where the trailhead is.",
          "Easy to follow trail system and nature trail around the circumference of the peak. Great views, weather and workout!",
          "Easier to climb than Echo Canyon, this trail typically gets crowded and has some parking lot issues. Leaving nearby is an advantage, we can access the summit trail from different angles that are less crowded. The view is fabulous!",
          "Many people on the trail. Not the easiest climb unless you are somewhat athletic. Some steep parts of the climb have handrails which are very helpful. Other steep parts of the climb do not have handrails, increasing the risk factor on those sections of the climb. As you huff",
          "Just minutes from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel where my wife and I stayed is one of several trail heads that will lead you to the top of the Peak. Count on moderate to strenuous hiking along the many well marked paths. We hiked in mid November and the weather was just about",

          "This peak is situated amid a park with several entrances. But they do not interconnect; at each entrance there are areas to relax. Is the weather is not to hot. It\u2019s also a place for picnics and families outdoor gatherings.",
          "This is not a good trail it goes up to the top and back down the same way. It has been worn down to sharp ragged rocks, no shade, and not that great of a view. This is an ankle twister because of the sharp rocks that make up the trai.",
          "I arrived at about 5:30AM on a Sunday, and by the time I left the trail (after 7) there was a line of cars out the parking lot. The trail itself is quite difficult- so wear appropriate shoes, take lots of water, and make sure you can handle stair-like footing. My dad accompanied",
          "Piestewa Peak is perfect for hiking after work - it's nearby, it offers a challenge, parking is easy. A little crowded but that's because so many others agree with me!",
          "Really enjoyed the hike, but I had to stop a couple of times to catch my breath. There were more people than I expected making the hike at the same time as us, and to my surprise, people were even starting the hike after dark, which I don't recommend because the trail is no",
          "The whole park allows you to find a trail that isn't over run and you can explore at your own pace. The actual Piestewa Peak that everyone is referring to when they hike there is a good workout. If you're in shape it shouldn't take more than 45 minutes and the last ten minutes",
          "We climbed this mountain this morning and it was rather tough and at times scary. Foot placement is crucial, with elevation increasing rapidly...which means a lot of different height steps or rock surfaces. People with knee, hip and ankle problems should stay away from this",
          "Piestewa Peak has something for everybody. Whether you're looking for a challenging peak hike or an easy, beautiful trail hike. The trails are well marked and the sights can't be beat. Absolute beauty everywhere you look! Bring plenty of water, even when the weather is nice and",
          "Had a few hours to spend while waiting for our flights, drove over to visit the Phoenix mountain preserve and ended up doing the summit trail hike. The views from the trail are amazing so even if time, or fitness level, prevents you from going all the way up to the top you will",
          "This was our first time to hike Piestewa, we usually only hike Camelback when here on vacation. But definitely will be back to this trail. We arrived at 530am on a Saturday and barely found a parking spot in all the parking lots they have here. Man people start early! But it",
          "We hiked the loop trail which goes around Piestewa Peak. It is far less travelled by hikers, takes about 2 hours, and has experienced some erosion. A very good work out in the middle of the city.",
          "Easy to get to & choice of either the \"standard\" hike or the 302/Circumference Trail, which tends to be less crowded. Both challenging & a great workout!",
          "As a member of Hiking Hikers Hiking 3H, I led an advanced hike from Dreamy Draw Park to the Piestewa peak circumferential trail #302 using various trails. We ascended about 800-900 feet.",
          "What a lovely place to spend the morning hiking. Don't forget your water bottle! A busy trail, but if you are alone, it makes you feel safe. Uneven terrain so not ideal for those who are not stable footed. The views are worth the climb",
          "If you are in shape you can get to the peak in 30 minutes. I go there each time I travel to Phoenix.",
          "We stayed at a resort nearby and walked to the peak trail area. Nice trails, very open, varying degrees of walks offered, well-used by other hikers and bikers.",
          "Do this hike early, there are several options...circumferenc trail is a great option to the summit. Take more water than you think you will need, sweatband or scarf, sunscreen, hat...use your head about your hiking level. Take breaks, drink water, enjoy the scenery.",
          "The view is still breathtaking, but after all these years I wish they could do something about the crowded parking and crummy bathrooms...",
          "Nice to hike during spring or winter in Summer you have to be prepared for the Heat . You cN see the city and the valley. It is better to go with friends and family. Awesome Hike !",
          "Parking is terrible. We absolutely loved the views. Lots of traffic for Hikers. I hike a lot and by far such a great way to see nature...lots of lizards, rabbits, and copperheads.",
          "We really like this hike, but you there always those few that run down the trail thinking that everybody else is in the way. Uh, news flash: This is a very busy trail and running down it is just dumb. Nobody thinks you look \"cool\" or \"ultra fit\". Everybody thinks you are a jerk,",
          "most of the walk is in the sun, so go early! although there was a breeze on the higher parts of the walk which cooled us a bit. enjoyed the walk and views at the top",
          "We climbed Piestawa Peak in December, 2013. Short hike, good trail, with a little rock scrambling near summit. The 360 degree views of Phoenix area and surrounding mountains were amazing.",

          "It is steep and a bit treacherous to get to the top. Take plenty of water. When you get there the 360 degree views are great as is the sense of achievement.",
          "There are several hiking options at Dreamy Draw Park and Piestewa Peak. You can go for the long, hard, trek or a more leisurely hike. The views from the top of the peaks are beautiful. The park is very convenient - just off the freeway and the parking is plentiful. We ran into a",
          "I first did this hike back in the early 2000s and wanted to do it again on a recent trip to Phoenix. It did not disappoint. The hike is a short 1.2 miles, but at times feels like it's straight up! According to the phoenix.gov website, total elevation gain for the summit trail is",
          "So glad our concierge recommended this hike, my 9 year old son and I had no problem navigating the peak and were able to experience some lovely views along the way. We went out a mile and back, since we had a senior and two younger children that weren't able to make the trek,",
          "I made a quick drive to this location on my last day in Phoenix. It was easy to find and there was plenty of parking for me since I came at 2:00 PM on a Thursday, but still quite a few people going up and down the hike. The temperature was around 90 and it got pretty hot about",
          "most local AZ people probably still call this Squaw Peak, but it was renamed to honor a servicewoman killed saving another servicemember's life during the recent war in Iraq. A nice tribute. This is an amazing park with a TON of hiking trails in and around it. The very last part",

          "When we lived in Phoenix years ago, we hiked up the peak on a pretty regular basis for exercise. While on vacation, we brought our teenage daughter to see if we still had it to make it to the top. After all these years (16), we made it! But it was much harder on the knees and",
          "My husband and I have climbed this peak several times. It's a great hike, and worth it. It does have a lot of steep, stair-like ups and downs that can be hard on the knees and ankles, so if you are expecting a hike up smooth paved trail, this may not be the hike for you. Take",

          "I don't get the attraction of Piestewa Peak which is why I am giving this an average score. It is just a mountain and there are so many better places to go in and around the Phoenix area to hike. But Piestewa Peak is not a hike - it is a gym workout. If you want a great",
          "we hiked this peak twice during our stay in Phoenix. The trail does get a bit more strenuous as you get closer to the top but is worth the hike if you can do it! I am not sure who it is later in the day, but parking is at a premium in the morning as everyone heads here before",
          "Well marked hiking trails for all abilities. Make sure you bring lots of water . Parking will probably be an issue on weekends. Breath-taking views of the valley.",
          "Piestewa Peak is a great hike with spectacular views. The trail provides a good workout, with some high stepping required in certain sections. I made it up to the saddle but not the very top of the peak. The view from the saddle was gorgeous!",
          "This is a very strenuous hike. It took us about an hour to get to the top, and we are in fairly good shape. And it took about 30 minutes to come down. Wear athletic shoes or light hiking shoes. The view is worth it. The hike is misleading because at least 5 times it looks",
          "We had no idea what we were facing as we started our walk which turned in a climb; a few stops along the way; moments of indecision on whether to continue and then making it to the top was glorious. It was nearly 1 1/2 hours up and 30-40 minutes down; a little rough on the knees",
          "As an urban mountain park and trail, too many people ruin the experience. Avoid this area for more remote places such as Cave Creek or even South Mountain Park in sourthern Phoenix.",

          "The only thing to dislike about hiking to the top of this mountain and seeing the whole of Phoenix from the top is the number of overeager young people running up and down, killing their knees without knowing it. I have made this hike many times as have a lot of people, and will",
          "This one was a nice hike. I just found it strange that most of the hike was a trail, like it was all built to the top. Still, a physical effort and I liked it. Nice view from the top. recommended.",

          "Hate the name change! Really? But the hike is awesome. You get rewarded with an awesome view at the top although be prepared to shimmy through a hole to get to it. It's also quite rough on your knees going down so be prepared for that also. Lots of stairs which is a great work",

          "My two daughters (17 and 14), my wife and I hiked to the peak in December. Being from Toronto the mid-day temperature of 20 degrees Celsius was perfect. For people in good shape this is not strenuous hike but I do recommend bringing at least a bottle (500 mL) of water for each",
          "My husband and I went with our two boys- 5 and 8- and had a great time. Easy to find and access. Not too crowded at early afternoon. It was challenging for us tourists, but not too hard. The guys all made it to the top, I made it about 3/4- but am 6 months pregnant:) Bring water",

          "Met so many nice people here. Parking is excellent, they just renovated it recently and made it so much more accessible. The hike can be hard if you don't take breaks but otherwise you'll be able to reach the peak in about an hour",
          "Loved our 4.5 mile hike on the Freedom Loop! Just the amount if challenge we were looking for. Stunning desert beauty all around! We especially enjoyed the quiet solitude of the \"back half\" of the loop; the forward-facing side was very busy this Saturday afternoon",
          "Such a beautiful hike and view! The hike to the top of the peak is challenging especially if you aren't used to hiking mountains. They have benches to rest at throughout the hike. The views are spectacular and worth the hike!! They have \u2026",
          "Great local Phoenix hike. Very nice to see the city making improvements to the parking areas and adding new bathrooms. Just making it better for everyone. Awesome that the park opens at 5am. Got to get up to the top and watch the sunrise. \u2026",
          "Very nice area, I usually start at the Dreamy Draw trail-head. I run a loop up from Piestewa Peak's backside and down the front to the busy populated section. I've hiked the main trail with a weighted vest of 75lbs to the top once before \u2026",
          "Challenging and fun! I've hiked it 4 or 5 times and it's a great challenge to keep the pace up while going up and honestly really fun to jog down! On the flip side it's really beautiful if you're just looking to walk at a leisurely pace. \u2026",
          "I haven't been here in a while because of construction but they have finished construction on the main parking lot and everything looks amazing. Awesome bathroom setup. Fountain to fill water bottles. No more one way parking lot to get \u2026",
          "Loved it. Great hike. Rocky and little steep. But what fun is a hike without some challenge. Love the view from the top. Make sure to wear good shoes with grip for this one.",
          "Awesome hike, did this hike with my wife and teenage boys. It was just enough of a challenge to make it feel like a easy workout. Would definitely do it again.",
          "My daughter chose the trail here. It was a nice walk. The little trail signs that were on this path were blank. Out of six trail guides only two had information on them. So we missed out on what we were suppose to look at. I think it was \u2026",
          "Its a difficult hike because its pretty steep but well well worth it once at the top!",
          "Awesome area for hiking and running. Just be careful during May-October. I\u2019m a local and still almost had heatstroke last year.",
          "I hiked a challenging hike with wonderful views in a great location. So many trails (of all levels) to choose from. Lots of parking and well maintained bathroom facilities and drinking fountains.",
          "Great hike, but definitely not something for the light-hearted or novice hikers out there! It pretty much is straight incline all the way and a solid workout. The views of the valley are quite amazing from Camelback to Downtown Phoenix \u2026",
          "Great place to hike with lots of options. Parking isn\u2019t so great, at least on weekends and holidays. Still, love this place and enjoy the views from the top. Definitely well traveled.",
          "What a great hike...2.5 miles round trip to the very peak. Moderate hike mainly uphill on stairs. The views from up top are just stunning.... Definitely a good resistance training mountain... Good to run down",
          "New parking yeah! Awesome up and down with a terrific view at the top. Several different levels while your hiking. Lots of friendly people encouraging you. Best of Arizona for a quick fun yet challenging hike. Can be done with friends or \u2026",
          "It's a good hike with great views, but it does kind of feel like a star stepper all the way to the top. Worth doing, but not a favorite. There can be big crowds, so arrive early. It can be hiked day or night.",
          "Lots of water fountains and bathrooms at the base. Challenging hike up the mountain but should only take 75-100 minutes up and down.  Need to be in reasonable shape though. It's like climbing a rocky set of very jagged stairs.",
          "Great hike! Know before you go. There are no bathrooms or emergency water supplies on the mountain so come prepared, wear sunscreen and be ready for a real hike. The hikers are mostly friendly and helpful. It's a nice environment. 4 benches to rest so pace yourself. There is a medallion at the top and a stunning view. Enjoy!",
          "Fun hike and not too hard or anything. There\u2019s a lot of rocks and switchbacks. Overall good, relatively easy hike with some pretty good views at the top.",
          "It's a real gem in the center of our city. A great place to get a little while away for a little while. Lots of easy trails in the back. New construction looks great",
          "It's a VERY long hike, almost 4 miles to the peak and back to the summit, and it's very steep at points. But definitely worth the hike. The view is breathtaking.",
          "Very good place to hike. The trails are of different levels and hikers would love to hike here.",
          "It's a beautiful hike with very good views. It's rated extremely hard and most of the hike is Rocky terrain. Definitely take a lot of water. Dogs are not allowed and I would think it's too dangerous for kids.",
          "I've never been on a hike before but it was a great experience doing it at this location for sure. Made it to the top on my second attempt. This trail took my hiking virginity for sure!! As a beginner it was about an hour and 3 falls to get \u2026",
          "This is one of the best places to hike in the Phoenix area. There are several trail heads with varying difficulties. I like that they have made a ton more parking spaces so people aren't parking on the side of the as much (Still happens).",
          "Best trails in Phoenix to get lost in! Take some extra water with you, as the trail markings are not always clear, and a 3 mile hike could turn into 5 miles...  Views are wonderful. I enjoy the Quartz Ridge Trail for a quick 1.5 mile hike, while having an amazing backdrop of downtown phoenix the whole way up.",
          "Great hike! Making it to the top is a good challenge with a beautiful panoramic view of the city.",
          "Nice place to hike. It is not very difficult. Takes about an hour and a half to go up and down.",
          "This is definitely a double black diamond. If you are looking for a casual hike go somewhere else. If you want a challenge with rough terrain and beautiful views this is the place. Bring twice the water you think you need and bring a flashlight.",
          "Great hike close to the city. Good view of the city and a great place to watch the sun set.",
          "Love this hike. Just hate I can't take my dog.",
          "Very first time up! Took an hour. Well maintained, super busy! Nice folks climbing together.",
          "Take water and your time going to the summit. Went on a Saturday morning and waited for a parking space. The trail was crowded but most people yielded to the climbers going up. Saw a few  little kids and a wedding proposal mid way on the trail.",
          "Easily accessible, can go up all the way to the top for a serious challenge. Or just do the first few pit stops. Excellent views anytime but the full moon hike is one the most unique in the world, not many places has a mountain smack in the middle of the city.",
          "Good place to hike my little cousins were able to do it good workout",
          "Great trail a little hard for beginners. Have to get there early or else it's a little hard to find parking spot next to the trail",
          "The hills are very beautiful and overall the hike was great.",
          "Beautiful new bridge and lots more parking. The hiking ranges from mildly challenging to extremely challenging. Tip: Park all the way at the last parking lot. Not too many people go there. So it's quiet and peaceful.",
          "Recently they have renovated the trail. Very good. Lot of view spots that gives a good view of downtown as well. No dogs allowed. Carry at least 1 litre of water during summer. Happy hiking!!!",
          "Great hike perfect combination of incline and flat terrain",
          "Clear your mind and rejuvenate your spirit by hiking at Piestewa Peak. All types of trails for all skill levels. Bring your Dog, your kids your Grandparents! Great place in nature!",
          "Very nice hiking trails that are well maintained. Steep and challenging climb to the summit with rewarding views.",
          "The main trail is great. But there a lots of side trails that also lead up to fantastic vistas.",
          "Great hike! Sometimes parking is tight. They have great facilities and a very easy to navigate trail. Steep, but worth the views at the top!",
          "Perfect time of year.... Steeper than some trails I have been on, so great for the heart rate!!",
          "Loved this hike.  Very glad it was cloudy with a coolish breeze or it would be too much in the middle of the day.  Definitely different hiking conditions than other places.  Lots of loose rock made for a couple slips and near falls.  Wish \u2026",
          "Challenging hike up to the peak but great cardiovascular exercise and a great stress reliever out in nature. \nIt gets busy but I haven't seen the trails going to the top way over crowded.\nThere's also a few \"hidden\" paths away from hiking traffic that are great for meditation.",
          "Not very long, but it's a thigh and calf burner. And lungs and lower back and hip flexors. Great day hike! Some on the trail not so polite, but nothing major. Typically everyone is friendly.",
          "I\u2019m in decent shape and the hike took us about 40 minutes to the top and approximately 25 minutes down. The view from the top is only marginally better than half way up so if you\u2019re not in great shape, go up as far as you can because it is still really nice.",
          "Very well traveled and busy.  Multiple trails to explore.  Perfect for taking tourists to show off the Arizona cacti landscape.",
          "Perfect place to help you get a few thousand calories out of your diet",
          "A challenging hike for those ready to build endurance. The commute to multiple trailheads is easy from Phoenix and Scottsdale allowing for repeated ascents until it seems mundane and easy.",
          "Very serene. Lots of shade and a nice breeze. All while taking in beautiful sites all around, of breathtaking mountains, cactus, brush and unique rocks. Also, with a nice vantage of the city of downtown Phoenix.",
          "This is one of the easier mountains in Phoenix to hike. It is still a decent challenge and workout for most people. Wear good shoes and bring water. Hike in comfy temperatures and try to do it at sunrise (if you can fight the people). Plenty of parking below at the start of the trail.",
          "Beautiful scenery.  Great place to go hiking....",
          "It was hard.  Climbing and looking up it seemed never ending until it finally did.  If you haven't been going up stairs every day for at least a year, this will be difficult.  I'd recommend 3 bottles of water for beginners too.",
          "Great place to hike with good trails and scenery. Makes me feel spiritually humble with exercise",
          "PPP is fabulous for a quick desert hike. The flora is amazing! Take the road to the end for a quieter experience. There are portable potties onsite.",
          "Great view of entire valley!! HEAVILY trafficked- even at 6:00am. Good hike, good workout. Moderate. Not dog friendly. Parking lots full, parking along road.",
          "Great vertical gain in a short amount of time! Not for the beginner hiker. Wear grippy shoes, preferably trail runners. Very Rocky trail. Unmatched 360\u00b0 view of Phoenix. Awesome for sunrise or sunset pics!",
          "One of the best hiking trails in the city. Parking is limited, so you need to get there early. Fantastic views of Phoenix!!!",
          "It was beautiful, beautiful scenery, beautiful weather for a wonderful hike. Bathrooms are kept up well and that is very convenient.",
          "Nice trail. Steep but many sections has steps cut into or built onto the side of the mountain. Spectacular view from the top!",
          "Definitely was challenging and beautiful loved the visit will be back very soon",
          "The transformation of this place is incredible well just the entrance lol, \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd8a\ud83d\udc3a\n\nI have been coming here for years honestly ever since I was a kid and it's a great place to go for a hike, if you go 34 minutes before the sunset oh my \u2026",
          "Short and steep, but a good local hike. There were a lot of people trying to run. Really busy for runners and hikers at the same time.",
          "It is a very good hike, especially at night",
          "I love this place . It is stunning.  With nice views in every direction.",
          "The Phoenix park site indicates this hike is moderately difficult. It is actually rated extremely difficult. The cause for this rating is the elevation climb is quick. The trail is clearly marked and really very easy to navigate - you do \u2026",
          "Amazing place to get away. Many different trails.fun",
          "Bomb.com .... Amazing Sunrise.",
          "Beautiful day and gorgeous views. I can see why it is so busy, (but very friendly).",
          "Gorgeous views! Must do hike for beginners",
          "Very beautiful! Rough terrain, even with all the man made steps.",
          "Come early and bring plenty of water we got here at 6 am and it was already fairly crowded. There are several places you can rest on the way up, take your time because, the summit his very much worth the long steep hike up.  I definitely do \u2026",
          "Quite challenging but with beautiful Phoenix sights.  Step, step, step, step.  A thousand steps.  Great workout.  Trails well kept.",
          "Wonderful view of Phoenix AZ. I recommend to everyone to go there. It is Breathtaking.",
          "I'ts a good hike. I love foing to this one.",
          "Easy to get lost, but nice beautiful trail.",
          "It's not just the hike , but it seems everyone that goes there is kind . But still fantastic cardio",
          "Great hike, you will meet friendly people and dogs.   Great little hike.",
          "Great place to go hiking, bring plenty of water.",
          "Beautiful views, great workout, wonderful to talk to people from all over the Phoenix area and even around the country!",
          "Moderately difficult climb as advertised. Hiking shoes highly recommended. View is awesome and breathtaking!",
          "Awesome hike for glutes\ud83e\uddb5\ud83c\udf51. It's free",
          "Just beautiful, the park is excellent for hiking and for having a picnic.",
          "A nice place for hiking and very scenic place where you can see the entire city .",
          "AMAZING..... But I come from the corn fields so I'm easily impressed.",
          "Relatively short hike but with lots of elevation change. Easily completed in 2 hours and the path is easy to follow and stable (not a lot of loose sand/rocks). Great views of the valley at the top!",
          "It is an impressive mountain. You'll have to go in early to guarantee a parking spot. After certain time, the parking spot would be so full. There are construction projects going on there so traffic can get bad. Unfortunately, the trail is \u2026",
          "The renovations truly enhanced the area. With the bridge connecting the summit trailhead to the parkinglot to the multiple bathrooms close by. This is a wonderful im city hike to explore!",
          "It's a great trailhead with pullup n dip frame",
          "Always an amazing hike to the peak! This is a difficult and steep hike so come prepared with lots of water, and go early before the heat of the day sets in. The views of downtown Phoenix are beautiful. The fellow hikers are friendly and committed.",
          "It's so quiet and peaceful here. Beautiful",
          "I enjoy this hike, basically up and down in 2 hours, pretty steep towards the top but a good test.\n   Views are great, trail is easy to follow...usually go on a Friday, not too busy.",
          "All I can say is, beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.",
          "Beautiful views recommended for mid level hikers, not beginners",
          "Great hike! Beautiful views. Good workout.",
          "I believe it's been 1 to 2 years since I've gotten an opportunity to hike this massive beauty. Due to all of the recent and ongoing construction of the parking lots, and growing popularity, I've chosen to hike other trails in the meantime. \u2026",
          "Rated Difficult! On the other hand this is a beautiful hike. It is very rocky and steep.",
          "Absolutely fantastic. A diversity of trails for a diversity of hiking experiences. You'll never lose cell service, however, and most of the park is pretty heavily trafficked. Most of the trails are pup-friendly. Piestewa Peak is a Phoenix classic.",
          "So beautiful and if you want hiking its almost close to real hiking trails",
          "Nice urban hiking area. It always feels super busy here, and the last time I came I could hardly find a single spot. I arrived close to 8 am on a weekend. There was just so many cars. I wasn't the only car circling around for a spot either. \u2026",
          "What an amazing and awesome place! Had no idea that it would draw so many people from so many different languages and national backgrounds. Families on outings from toddlers  to elders and all mix in between were like pilgrims on a mission \u2026",
          "Trails are moderate to expert.  Just beautiful and clean.",
          "Fantastic urban park. However main trail is very busy. Luckily plenty of side trail to hike on.",
          "I love all the improvements in this place! The waiting it has been worthed",
          "Great hike for the well conditioned!  Not really a good hike for children.",
          "The highest trail is quiet a challenge, but the path is very defined. Very different feeling than camelback.",
          "Piestewa Peak is one of my favorite places to hike. It's a great challenge, provides a good workout, and provides absolutely wonderful views to look at as you go. Fun and safe environment.",
          "Is a good place for exercise",
          "Love this hike! Challenging!",
          "Made it to the top Love this place",
          "I love this place so much. It is the ultimate sanctuary for your soul!!",
          "There are multiple trails with varying difficulty. I've hiked two. The peak trail is pretty rough for beginners or those that are out of shape. It's doable- but take your time and drink plenty of water. There are spots to take rests along \u2026",
          "It makes you feel like you're on top of the world or that you've gone to the Mountaintop!",
          "First time here and sorry don't recall what trail name was but not too many people around until reached the top. Lots of folks going up from the east side where parking located. go early, finished about 1130 and there were people waiting for parking.",
          "I always like coming here for a quiet lunch break away from work. The park is incredibly noise free considering it's in the middle of the busy city.",
          "Better have hiking boots but absolutely beautiful",
          "What a great hike. There were sooooo many people out there, which is good for me. I'm a solo hiker and watching the headlamps bounce up the mountain was very comforting.\nReally beautiful and a great workout. Most of the people out there seem like they do it a lot. Stringy recommend going at sunrise.",
          "this is not a VERY DIFFICULT TRAIL. ignore the signs",
          "One of the best trails in Phoenix AZ. Moderate in difficulty, great cardio workout due to the steepness but trail is mostly semi paved so not as rough as say Echo Canyon trail",
          "Had a nice hike and pleasant views. Will definitely go again",
          "While exploring one if the many accessible trails, I kept thinking to myself how much my brother would enjoy mountain-biking this area. A lot of fun to explore, even on a warm day. It's about 94 today and enjoyed a short hike. A huge thanks \u2026",
          "Beautiful weather. Not too difficult.",
          "Awesome place to visit and hike.  Great views and many photo opportunities!",
          "Extreme feeling of accomplishment and a fantastic workout. Make sure to stay hydrated and take breaks!",
          "It is difficult to climb this type of mountain however it helps a lot to the blood circulation is adequate, when one goes up it takes on average 40 minutes at a moderate pace without much effort.",
          "Beautiful mountain desertscapes, lots of hiking trails. A quiet space in the middle of the city!",
          "This was a great hike..not for the weak at heart..great view from  over a mile up...",
          "Couldn't climb the mountains. Everything said stay off. And it displays open till 7 but the Park was telling people they had 10 minutes to vacate from a picnic area at 6pm. Scenery is nice though.",
          "First  time  here at night. Beautiful  night hike and the moon  tonight  was just amazing.  So worth it.  I was just blown  away  with  the view.",
          "Great let workout! Take plenty of water!",
          "I love hiking here!! The only downside is that it gets way too crowded once temps are better and parking sucks during this time.",
          "Quick, fun leg burner!!",
          "Had a wonderful time. Dogs liked it too.",
          "March was an awesome time to hike. Low 70s. Trails were great and not too steep. Fun times. Can't wait to hike again in July...early morning!",
          "Perfect example of beautiful rugged AZ desert right here in the city.  On another note, why are they building handicap ramps?  Absolutely ridiculous mis appropriation of tax dollars. Ramps built connecting to streets w/o sidewalk is the design of a buffoon. -Good job city of Phoenix planners.",
          "I hope they finish the parking construction soon. Right now it is hard to find a spot and you will likely have to walk for a good distance from your car to reach the trail. This mountain is super fun and fairly challenging. Everyone loves \u2026",
          "Nice and good view. Good place to hike and have fun with your buddy.",
          "Great hike for the morning",

          "Best place for a startup hike and a good workout",
          "Best hike in all the valley! Bring water and be prepared if you have not hiked this before. Piestawa will get the best of you if you\u2019re not careful!",
          "Best views in valley...difficult summit trail hike...others are less challenge",
          "Popular hiking trail up the summit but many trails around the area less crowded and really beautiful",
          "Great hike and and even better view.",
          "The scenic view was amazing and the weather couldn't have been more perfect making my hike very memorable. I'd suggest taking lots of water I had a water backpack with 2 liters I drank all of it!  I also came across a few lil critters that made my experience here amazing! Definitely coming back!",
          "Great hike here.",
          "Mountain was really fun to climb but also hard...if it's your first time climbing a mountain this shouldn't be your 1st lol",
          "Get to Piestewa early for parking! Beautifully maintained trails and friendly people.",
          "Great place to hike and wasn't nearly as crowded as Camelback.",
          "Awesome trail, rated extremely difficult, however I'm 275lb and I tackled 80% of it, not too bad. So don't be discouraged because you're heavier set.",
          "Hiked to the top and back. Terrific fun!",
          "Difficult difficult difficult. If you are looking for a stroll or a hike with the family I would not go and find a different trail. The views from the top are amazing, especially when you catch them at sunrise. As of mid-July theit is a ton of construction but once it's done you can tell it will be super nice.",
          "Beautiful views well worth the climb.",
          "Nice hike in the city",

          "Very nice place to take a hike.",
          "Nice views, great place for a 'stair' workout...",
          "Great place to hike!!! Pretty strenuous but worth the view.",
          "One of the toughest hike trail inside the city. I have made within 46 mins without proper rest. If you are a beginner then be sure about the challenge you gonna get. Its worth it when you made to the top. Go early as possible and enjoy.",
          "I would rate this trail as moderate. It has great views and is very rewarding.",
          "Awesome hiking nice trails. When your hiking about mid way up the mountain there are natural springs just flowing into small water falls very nice beautiful scenery.",
          "Best quick hike I\u2019ve found in Phoenix so far. Minus from home, up and down in an hour if you push it. Or, take your time, enjoy the scenery and foliage.  Breathtaking views from the top.  A must do if you are visiting or live here.  I go several times a week if possible just for the workout",
          "Excellent hiking and scenery! One of the true outdoor gems inside a city of concrete.",
          "This is always a nice strenuous hike and doing ot on the evening is so nice since it isn't as crowded and people tend to be more courteous than in the day time.",
          "I wasn't sure I'd make it up, but I did it!!! Beautiful views!!!",
          "Awesome moderate hike",
          "Incredible urban hiking",

          "Great trail with multiple paths, plenty of  free parking and fantastic views",

          "Great place to relax the mind.",
          "Good quick hike. But still must have water depending on the time you are hiking.",
          "Beautiful views, and even better exercise!",
          "I still love climbing it in my 50s",
          "If you're looking for a good workout this is the hike. You will begin to feel it about halfway through. The scenery at the top is worth it though. It is definitely worth checking out. The only bad thing is that there is some construction going on, but it's no big deal at the end of the day.",

          "Too many people don\u2019t understand that up has the right of way. It\u2019s so simple yet apparently is difficult for some people to comprehend. Particularly those that are coming down the mountain being complete idiots. Sometimes I have to yell at them.",
          "I like to hike here because the route I take is not too difficult for me, its listed as moderate. Its about 1 and a half miles which is perfect for me to do a few times a week. I cant do steep serious hiking so that trail is perfect for me. I think it was trail 304. It is quite busy so if you dont like people you may not like it.",

          "Good place to hike.. lovely view and clean..I recommend to anyone",
          "A great hike, I would say moderate. Be aware that Google maps may lead you to a private, gated entrance in a neighborhood depending on which direction you are coming from. If you can go at sunset please do, the views are stunning. I didn't make it to the peak since it was getting dark, but I definitely want to go again!",
          "The trial signed as extremely difficult. Thats True but for last 15 min of hiking. Getting the pik takes appx 2 hours of really slowly walking. There are some place where high attention is required. Excellent place to burn some calories.",

          "Be sure to read the signs before tackling the trails. Some are for novices and some are for more experienced hikers....I'm not one of them.",
          "This is the best mountain hike in the Phoenix area. Love it.",
          "It a awesome trail but construction making park hard",
          "This is an ok hike that never really feels like you left the city, but is good exercise. There is not much to see on this hike, but if you do it at night the views of the surrounding city are beautiful!",
          "Good hike. Thanks to the City of Phoenix for improving parking lot.",
          "Under construction. Trail to summit has lots of steps. Lots of runners. Pretty views.",
          "Piestewa Peak is a nice place to hike close to the city. Very popular in the mornings and gets pretty crowded, so it's best to avoid those times. Most people hike straight up the mountain but you can take the trail around it or explore \u2026",
          "Loved it, I would go back again \ud83d\ude0a \ud83d\ude01",
          "Great people",
          "Great trails and desert views right in the middle of the city.",
          "Amazing view of the sunrise  overlooking the city! It's worth it to climb to the top.",
          "While it may not get all the attention of nearby Camelback, this is probably more strenuous due to the elevation gain over a shorter distance.  Plus it has the advantage of giving you great views in all directions and is less crowded than Camelback.  This trail is  essentially one big natural staircase with a couple of landings.",
          "Great place to hike in Arizona. Phoenix Mountain Preserve. Just be careful with the high heat.",
          "FYI - this park is in the same area as the Phoenix Mountains Preserve. Once you are in the park, there are multiple trails to chose from. Some easy and others difficult. This day I chose trail #304 which is a loop and most times you are \u2026",
          "Not for beginners but definitely with it.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous!  This place is worth the sweat and sore muscles once you reach the top.",
          "Beautiful views on the mountain top!",
          "Love this park! Closes too early and sometimes it is too crowded. But it is a fun place to go!",
          "Squaw peak great work and 91 flights of stairs it's pretty difficult second only to Camelback. Best early in morning from heat and to get decent parking.",
          "It's a steep hike, but the park is very well kept and the 360 views are worth the climb. Be ready for a challenge and bring lots of water along with some snacks or lunch.",
          "You could do some great hiking here",
          "Visited many times. I avoid the main trail as I have dogs and don't like crowds. The other trail can be very challenging and fun. Hours could be better in summer due to heat. Say 4am to 10pm.  I would recommend this trail.",
          "Hard but good!!",
          "Fun climb",
          "Best hiking in Phoenix",
          "Many beautiful trails with views of multiple peaks..",
          "The trail is longer than you'd think. It's a great hike on a day with mild weather. There are plenty of places to sit and rest on the way up. It gets steeper near the top. Be aware that it takes a long time to hike back down and it gets very dark when the sun starts to set.",
          "nice hiking go early it's hot",
          "Great hike!  Cold day, a little rain, even some hail.",
          "Excellent place to have a nice hike",
          "Hard if you're fat and out of shape like me.  Beautiful views at the top.",
          "It's one of my favorite hikes. The parking isn't amazing, carpool if you can.",
          "Great place for hiking. Lots of trails not just the summit trail. Also lots of picnic tables and great places to sit and enjoy the gorgeous desert views.",
          "If there is one hike that I would recommend to somebody visiting Phoenix it would be Piestewa Peak. The views are just as good as Camelback, and the hike is much easier. After about 1.2 miles of what feels like mother nature's \u2026",
          "This is an amazing hike if you have never done it, located in the central Phoenix area it is the highest peak in the valley. It's definitely a difficult hike and very steep towards top, with lots of slick rocks so make sure you bring shoes \u2026",
          "Stunning views when you hike up this mountain.  Just a word of caution, I have sprained my ankle twice on this mountain due to not wearing the right shoes.  Highly recommend that you wear HIKING SHOES, not trail runners.  You can easily roll and ankle coming down and you don't want the helicopters to come pick you up.",
          "Love it \ud83d\udda4",
          "This is such a great workout and a good view but parking is a nightmare. Also, there are way too many people on weekends and many of them are super rude.",
          "This is what makes living in Arizona worth it. Who cares if it's 105 degrees at 5am.\ud83d\ude02",
          "Great place to exercise",
          "Beautiful Desert views,  with a challenging hike.",
          "Very  rocky  but great views.",
          "Great hike for being so close to downtown. Can be quick but strenuous enough",
          "It's better to hike during day time during November and December.",
          "It's so beautiful there only wished we saw some birds flying around.",
          "Great trail",
          "Difficult hike to the peak, but the beautiful views reward you!",
          "Amazing views!!",
          "Appears to be a good place for hiking but I was looking for some sunset photos. I got some but in my opinion limited views",
          "Amazing views. Trail is steep at the end.",
          "Definitely a must for locals and visitors !",
          "So many people plan on hiking to the summit of pasta peak that they forget that there are so many other trails out there to hike. Once you get to the middle of the park you don't hear any other civilization other than occasional plane flying over.",
          "Incredible views!!! Best in town",
          "If You want a WORK OUT...JUST DO IT!!",
          "One of my favorite hikes?",
          "I love Piestewa trails",
          "I haven't been there in many years...was a great hike the last time I was there. To me, it's still Squaw Peak, can't even pronounce this wacky new name. Rotten shame that some people feel compelled to change all the place names to \"politically correct\" junk.",
          "Beautiful place",
          "Great hike... pretty moderate for active people.  Beautiful views and manageable.  location is awesome in the heart of Phoenix... parking is sometimes a challenge but overall one of my personal favorites. ",
          "Challenging hike, can get crowded in the summer times so get there supper early! Great to do if you are short on time but want to hike! Take water, snack, fruit and catch a sunrise/sunset they are gorgeous! \n\nGood hike for kids, just be careful, stay on trail and bring water and a head/flashlight for early or night hikes!",
          "Great hike, can't wait until the parking lot is do.",

        "wiki": "The Wrigley Mansion in Phoenix, Arizona, is a landmark building constructed between 1929 and 1931 by chewing-gum magnate William Wrigley Jr.  \nIt is also known as William Wrigley Jr. Winter Cottage and as La Colina Solana.\nLocated at  2501 East Telewa Trail, it sits atop a 100-foot (30 m) knoll with views of greater Phoenix to the south, close to the Arizona Biltmore Hotel, which Wrigley owned.\n\n\n== History ==\nArchitect Earl Heitschmidt of Los Angeles designed the home at a cost of $1.2 million, in a combination of styles including Spanish Colonial.  It has 24 rooms, 12 bathrooms, and over 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2).  Much of the extensive tilework was shipped to Phoenix from Wrigley's own factory in Catalina, hauled by mule to the site.\nThe Wrigleys maintained other residences in Chicago; Philadelphia; Lake Geneva, Wisconsin; Catalina Island; and Pasadena, and used this, the smallest of their houses, for only a few weeks a year. William Wrigley died in 1932, shortly after its completion.\n\nWrigley Mansion ClubIn July 1992, Geordie Hormel bought the mansion and made it available for meetings, conventions and similar functions. Due to zoning regulation, The Wrigley Mansion must operate as a private club.\n\n\n== Landmark designations ==\nThe Wrigley Mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.The mansion has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride.The mansion has been Winner of The Knot Weddings for 2011, 2009, and 2008.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of historic properties in Phoenix, Arizona\nPhoenix Historic Property Register\nHouses in Phoenix, Arizona\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Wrigley Mansion Club website",

          "Although it has not been owned or lived in by the Wrigley family for many years, I guess that this will always be known as the Wrigley Mansion.The current owners are members of the Hormel Meat Packing family. While it is truly luxurious it is not ostentatious or gaudy.",
          "We went for the tour and planned on staying for dinner. Our tour was delayed because the guide was giving a private tour for a couple. They asked us to wander around until our guide was done. We just strolled behind the couple and eavesdropped. I admit I expected more. The piano",
          "What can I say. We only paid 5 dollars for both of us on the self guided tour. It was ok. Most of the residence is used for weddings. The bar and restaurant looked nice. Did not eat here. Wish they could have made it more like when Mr. Wrigley lived here.",
          "This mansion was a fun place to visit and see how the inventor of Wrigley gum lived. The room decorated with gum wrapper wall paper was interesting.",
          "An amazing attraction. Our guide was very good, and I learned a lot about the Wrigley family. It was worth the price of the visit just to see and hear the world's only Steinway player piano!",
          "Museum and tour guide were great. The new chef was mentioned several times so we looked forward to the lunch as we overlooked the city from the lovely dining room.it was the worst meal we have had all year. I wonder if the chefs claim to fame is burnt or overcooked. That is not",

          "Such a wonderful surprise. We found this on accident! It is such a beautiful property and an interesting history. We love seeing historically interesting buildings. They have maintained this so well. We'd go back to have drinks and dinner there - beautiful! Well worth the $35",

          "This mansion has a fantastic view of the surrounding valley and is full of history. While the house itself isn't as amazing inside as I expected from the outside, I can definitely understand why Mr Wrigley would build a \"winter cottage\" where he did. It's beautiful.",
          "Feels like another era when you visit. Beautiful lounge plus large rooms for parties. Took the house tour to see how the other 0.5% used to live. The view of the mansion as you approach is not as dramatic as it used to be before the mansions in front of it were built, but still",

          "Went here on Sunday for a large family brunch. The views are fantastic and there is a reason William Wrigley wanted his mansion perched on the best hill in Phoenix. Where else can you sip a cup of coffee with 360 degree views. There is an excellent selection of food and the",
          "This is a very special place and great for a drink in the bar to catch the spectacular Arizona sunsets or for a meal. William Wrigley died in the upstairs master bedroom and so the house has a lot of stories in history. The staff is very helpful and eager to be sure you enjoy",
          "Busy, very busy Mother's Day brunch. I felt as if the entire city of Phoenix had the same idea to come here. They did a great job of seating everyone, getting drinks for us, and directing everyone to the proper buffet lines. Food was delicious. Building was impressive to walk",

          "I very much enjoyed the tour of the house. Our guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. The tour is not very wheelchair accessible no ramps and if you have a wide chair it will not fit thru some doorways. We ate lunch outside and the view was beautiful. The food was OK but",
          "The Wrigley Mansion is beautiful, but the way to really experience the beauty is to visit on a Sunday for one of their special Champagne brunch's. Food was outstanding in quality and variety. Prime rib, chicken, pork, variety of shell fish, omelets to order and to finish it",
          "Great tour and lunch package. Docent was very knowledgeable and patient with questions. Lunch was enjoyable. Only complaint is they tack on $5 fee for non members at the end of the meal. This information is not listed on line or when you check in. When questioned, I he",

          "I stumble upon that place on a Sunday not realizing the spread for their Brunch. Wow. The place is so unique and the food is out of this world. I hope to go back again, when I am in Phoenix. What an experience. Loved the place, the food, the service. Loved it all.",
          "My wife and I took her sister and brother-in-law to dinner at the Wrigley Mansion and were pleasantly surprised with their revamped menu. The food was good the last time we went, but this time the menu had (in my opinion) a more thorough menu with more ingredients/original",

          "I recommend arriving during happy hour. You can have a cocktail, pay an additional $5, and then tour the mansion on your own. I\u2019m sure the guided tour is worth it, but when watching expenses this was outside my budget. $15/person? Nice staff. Phoenix has saved a gem.",
          "Had the one hour tour last week. Lots of interesting history about the Wrigley Family and also about the new owners.......Hormel (spam). You can have a nice lunch there at Geordies, after the tour. To make reservations for the tour, just call the number on their website.",

          "During our trip to Spring Training we stopped by the mansion for a tour. A couple things you should know before going. The mansion is at the top of a really steep driveway and if you don't want to pay $10 for valet parking you will park at the lower lot and walk pretty far up",
          "The Wrigley Mansion is not that large, but it is well worth a tour to hear about the family and the history of the gum magnate. Our tour took about an hour and the guide was very knowledgable and nice. They have an interesting player piano also. The mansion had a great dining",

          "Being able to tour the Mansion was a great treat and the addition of the photos of how it looked when it was owned by Wrigley added to the appreciation. The player paino is amazing and worth admission. The restraurant - lunch and tour package is a great value and the views on",

          "I sincerely appreciate the Wrigley family legacy and the overall history. The property has a dining room with some new (but not awesome) views of the Phoenix Biltmore area. I would not go out of my way to see this property and I would not classify as a must see in Phoenix.",

For a list of zoos, see List of zoos. For an annotated list of defunct zoos and aquariums, see List of former zoos and aquariums.\nA butterfly house, or conservatory is a facility which is specifically intended for the breeding and display of butterflies with an emphasis on education. Some butterfly houses also feature other insects and arthropods.  Butterfly houses are owned and operated by museums, universities, non-profit corporations, and private individuals as part of their residence; as well as small businesses that are owner operated.\nThe pattern of butterfly parks isn't new. In fact, such exhibits of butterflies were extremely popular in England by the year 1970. Penang Butterfly Farm in Malaysia was introduced on March 29, 1986, which was tropical world's first creepy crawly and live butterfly haven.

          "A nice place to go next winter. The butterfly area will still be just as warm and humid, but it won't get to you as much then. It pretty cools to see the butterfly fly around.",
          "This is a great find. Short educational 3D movie before you go into the enclosed garden. Walk through the abundance of beautiful butterflies at your own pace or bring a book and sit on a bench for awhile.",
          "Cool visit. Stop first to see the movie as it sets the mood. Interesting to interact and be in their (butterflies) world. My 16 yr old son & my 80 yr old dad both really enjoyed it!! They also have reptiles & aquatic \" animals\". Groupon had tickets for $19. Worth it.",
          "The facility is large and clean! The 3D movie is wonderful. It\u2019s not only informative but beautifully done as well. The stage where you see the chrysalis and \u201chatching\u201d is really interesting but gets crowded. The inside of the butterfly greenhouse is clean and easy to maneuver",
          "We visited this amazing place on a Sunday. There are lots of butterflies, and education regarding not just butterflies, but reptiles as well. This was a magical experience watching these delicate creatures settle on flowers, plants, and people. (Against the rules to try to",
          "Tour of Butterfly Wonderland was initiated by my wife and I was not enthused. After completeing the tour found I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would recommend it.",
          "This is really an awesome experience! Get there before 1:00 to see the New hatched Butterflies being released each day. You can easily spend a couple hours here. Don\u2019t miss the reptiles and insect exhibit. The gift shop was fun too. My only negative of this is the cost. I don\u2019t",
          "We went with our kids and grandkids. Saw the 3-D movie first then entered the large conservatory. Even the grandkids had fun for about 20-30 minutes. Good for the whole family.",
          "This butterfly conservatory was absolutely a wonderland! It respesents a rainforest. The temperature inside, in February, was perfect, but I can only imagine how hot and steamy it must get in warmer months! There were so many butterflies flitting around. The displays started",
          "Start by watching a 3D movie about the Monarch butterfly. Even if you think you know about butterflies, you will learn something. The movie is well done. Next you will go into a small room with three glass windows, containing butterfly chrysalis, from many different",
          "What a delightful way to spend half a day! Be prepared for humidity in the Butterfly gardens which are intermittently misted to keep plants and butterflies healthy and happy. Adult admission is $29 but you can get a senior discount if over 65 that saves you $5. The guides in the",
          "I love butterflies and always try to see butterfly houses when I can. This one is nice, but not the best I\u2019ve seen. The rainforest animals were just as cool as the butterflies. The butterfly room is slick so be careful and gets crowded easily. They do not have the sweet water",
          "What an absolutely fun place to visit! From the 3D movie to the knowledgeable staff and a few extra exhibits, this was a very fun excursion. Great for kids, families and old people too.",
          "We wanted something interesting to do when we had guests in town that would be out of the ordinary, so we checked out Butterfly Wonderland. It's an amazing experience! It's a bit pricey, but we felt it was well worth it to be able to spend time inside the gigantic butterfly",
          "Sit in the solarium and watch butterflies around you. Interesting 3D film about monarch butterflies life. Insect and fus displays A vending machine selling insect snacks Gift shop seemed expensive. Ticket price on the pricey end. But butterflies were great!!",
          "Excellent educational opportunity for the young and old alike. It is very informative and the docents are very knowledgable. The exhibit is well controlled to prevent the loss of any of the species. You can roam through the indoor garden at will and when the butterflies are",
          "This was a well controlled exhibit. None of the species are indigenous so they are very careful that nothing other than humans get in or out. It is a very attractive display and quite interesting. It is definitely worthwhile for the nature lover and I think most young people",
          "Had a great day watching butterflies and enjoying the reptiles and fish. I also did the \"Special Guided Tour\" That made the day even better. Our guide was personable and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend it.",
          "My husband and I signed up for the Friday behind the scene tour and would not suggest that to other visitors. For the money spent, it does not offer that much more than a regular entrance, in fact several members that started with our group, left and just did their own walk",
          "Beautiful and big butterflies. Wish I had more time. Don't skip the video, it's very interesting. Kind staff.",
          "So many beautiful creatures, great photo opps amongst the colourful winged critters - they look like dancing fairies and if you're lucky, one or more will land on you. Suggest you wear something sky blue then you may get one of the giant blue butterflies land on you - size of",
          "We really enjoyed coming here. We were able to get discount tickets when added to our admission to the aquarium. Go here during the day as the butterflies are more active in the sunlight. Everyone of all ages seemed to be enjoying it.",
          "Four adults--two in their 20s, two in their early 50s. We purchased tickets online in October for visiting in December. The place was a nightmare. The crowds were incredible--people were shoulder to shoulder with no room to walk anywhere and enjoy the peace of the butterflies",
          "The weather wasn't the greatest around Xmas during Christmas so I spent a couple of hours here. The staff was all very passionate about butterflies and the fish and reptile sections were worth checking out too (part of the $25 entry fee).",
          "This place will bring the magic back, so make sure you\u2019re not cramming it into your day. You\u2019re going to enjoy watching a tiny little butterfly land on you, trusting that you will keep it safe from harm. Breathe and enjoy your time here. Don\u2019t rush through. Stop for just a bit.",
          "The most peaceful part of our vacation. What a pristine environment to watch nature at its finest. Our children were so happy to feel the butterfly flutters!",
          "Watching movie about butterflies and exhibit was better than expected. Kids enjoyed the visit. Nice cafe inside, clean bathrooms",
          "Had an amazing time here, loved the butterflies! But by far the star of the whole visit were the chickens! These good boys (or girls) we\u2019re helping to control the big populations inside the conservatory (bugs other than the butterflies at least). They were a welcome surprise,",
          "We were looking for things to do while we were in Scottsdale and this popped up on trip advisor as a place to visit. I\u2019m so glad we did. You get to see butterflies molting out of their cocoons and into beautiful butterflies. Next you get to wander around the conservatory while",
          "been there more times then i can count! love taking kids of all ages to see the butterflies and they really get all excited if one lands on them and they get great photos! stunning pieces of glass art work and beautiful pond with fish surrounded with flowers and butterflies!! a",
          "I was expecting there to be some decorations in the main area where the butterflies were but there were not. The room is the same year round I assume. It is warm so you do not want to be wearing heavy sweaters and jackets. The butterflies were quite active in the daytime. There",
          "My 5 and 2-year-old nieces loved it. As a butterfly fan, it was delightful. The atrium was large enough, even with the Thanksgiving vacation happening, there was plenty of space to move around.",
          "We visited Butterfly Wonderland in tandem with Odysea. You can spend the whole day at this compound. The Butterfly Wonderland was beautiful and interesting and included bugs and lizards, as well. An excellent place for children to learn about all of these creatures.",
          "What a surprise and very enjoyable experience at the butterfly exhibit. I expected to see some butterflies and maybe see some interesting displays. What I didn't expect was to be surrounded by 100's of butterflies and moths that were close enough to touch (but do not do that, it",
          "Loved this place. There were many different kinds of butterflies, and we loved walking around several times to see what we could. After buying a snack, we went through the other exhibits. They had bugs, reptiles, and some fish. Then we went back to see more butterflies. The",
          "I loved it!!. If I lived in Arizona I would get a membership . It is so beautiful and relaxing. The reptile tour guide was fantastic . You can tell he loves his job. He he great with the kids too. I was just in amazement the whole time.",
          "Very nice place to know more about butterflies. They have a cool movie play in the beginning and it teaches a lot, we loved it!",
          "I love butterflies and this was heaven. The monarch video alone at the beginning of the exhibit is worth the visit. Highly recommend.",
          "It is so awesome to be in here with all the butterfly's. They will land on you. It is really peaceful as long as there aren't any screaming children. I would not pay to go back. It is very pricey but worth going once when family visited from out of town.",
          "We came here a few years ago, and the kids have been talking about it ever since! The return trip was worth it! Interact with the many species of butterflies in their natural environment. Take pictures, relax. Plan for at least a few hours, and wear brightly colored clothing",
          "Took the behind the scenes tour. The most impressive part of the tour was the passion and the pride of the people we interacted with through the tour. The tour guide obviously cares about the conservatory making the experience memorable. Was very impressed with Charlie who took",
          "Took my friend\u2019s 17 year old daughter and she loved it. The short film about Monarch Butterflies is inspiring and gets you ready to experience the Butterfly room. It\u2019s small and humid but a great way to get lost for an hour!",
          "My Grandkids loved this place. What a wonderful way to experience nature up close and personal. Great way to spend an afternoon.",
          "Well, overlooked by us for the time they've been open!! We went with some visiting friends who had looked this up on the internet. We really weren't expecting much, but boy were we surprised!!! The entire venue is so well done, it's amazing! Just walking down the entry hall,",
          "They say this is the largest in the United States. Over 10,000 butterflies they day we went of all types. A 3D movie on the Monarch buttery fly migration is shown before the entrance. Inside are other side exhibits, gift shop, and snack bar. My wife loved it. We don't live in",
          "My in-laws and I enjoyed the Behind the Scenes Tour with Adrian. She was very knowledgable and was able to answer the group's various questions. The butterflies were lovely to see and there was a good variety. There was also a small reptile viewing hallway, as well as a small",
          "Nice very hot in there. Nice colors. Dont expect a strip joint. Anal but ok for 30 minutes. Good venue.",
          "Great place to learn about butterflies from cocoon to adult. See them being born and walk among many different types. Great place for kids and old alike.",
          "My wife and I really did not know what to expect when we visited this attraction. First: it is indoors, so offers a welcome break from mid-summer heat. Second: it has welcome hours (we visited late afternoon on a Sunday). You start off with an educational and entertaining",
          "We bought year pass along with aquarium. It is very small and we were done in less than one hour but it is the kind of place you can bring young children on a regular basis. There are various animals there to help with plants and bugs along with butterflies. My granddaughter was",
          "Butterfly Wonderland is a great place for all ages. Starting with very educational and informative short film about the butterflies and their migration then moving on to experiencing the butterflies up close. Be sure to wear bright colored clothes to attract the butterflies to",
          "I would recommend stopping by if you\u2019re in the area. It\u2019s a really beautiful place and the staff is super friendly and informative. There are also some little chickens in the enclosure which were adorable.",
          "There are so many beautiful butterflies. And great place to go on a date :). If you aren't interested in butterflies, then you might speed through it and it's not worth your money. I do like watching the short clip of the migration of monarchs.",
          "We took our granddaughters 10 & 7 and they enjoyed spotting the butterflies but there weren\u2019t any hands on activities included like at the butterfly pavilion in Denver. I would assume that it\u2019s because the OdySea Aquarium is next door and does have some interactive exhibits. I",
          "Absolutely incredible to see all of the varieties of beautiful butterflies. Loved the gorgeous flora throughout the habitat as well. Both my husband and I had butterflies land on us, which was truly amazing! I highly recommend coming to this place, you will leave in awe!",
          "Obviously If you like butterflies you will want to go here. There are so many types of butterflies in every color you can imagine. Small ones, very large ones; it seems as if they have every butterfly in the world there. It\u2019s a very unique and beautiful experience to be among",
          "All Eric Carle\u2019s themed including the restrooms. This is appealing to all ages. They have the 3D informational video about the monarch butterfly which was awesome! The display with so many cocoons hatching right there in front of you was neat! They claim to be the biggest",
          "We went with my grandson when he broke his hip at age 8. He was very fragile and this place was very accommodating as far as his wheelchair. It was relaxing for him which we needed. We were able to take our time and he loved it when the butterflies landed on him. We will return.",
          "You are funneled through a hallway to see the flight of a monarch short 3-D movie. Movie was entertaining but prefer not to have to wait for that. The area where the butterflies are is very nice, humid, but nice. Lots and lots of butterflies. All shapes, sizes and colors. They",
          "We loved, loved, loved this place. The 3D movie on the Monarch Butterfly was incredible. Had we had more time, we would have stayed and watched it a second time. The butterfly house was beautiful. The plants, the butterflies and the two little hens clucking about were wonderful",
          "This place is tiny but absolutely magical. I visited with my sister and nephew and we all loved it. You have to be very gentle because butterflies might land on you, so no running, rushing, etc. we really enjoyed our visit!",
          "We visited on a Friday, first thing in the morning and avoided crowds. What a treat! Having visited butterfly sanctuaries in Florida and Minnesota, this was an interest of mine. Very well presented and a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Grand opportunity to learn more of our",
          "We LOVE Butterflies & we LOVE that Eric Carle\u2019s Very Hungry Caterpillar is celebrating the 50th Anniversary of his book. So FANTASTIC!! I LOVED seeing this. You can do a Combo ticket Aquarium/ Butterfly Wonderland for ADULT $59.95.. a SAVINGS!! I just so happened to have",
          "I like kids and I love butterflies.. but maybe an all-adult evening would be a good idea for this venue. I got really depressed after seeing more than 1 kid rip the wings or legs off of butterflies they had captured. Running, shrieking kids just ruin the atmosphere. Could",
          "If you are a butterfly and nature lover, this is an absolute must. I could literally sit in here for hours and hours, watching the butterflies play. There are also many other areas for you to explore, i.e., bugs, reptiles, fish, stingrays, 3D movie, etc. Definitely recommend",
          "Took my granddaughter to Butterfly Wonderland and what a pleasant surprise! First we started with a 3-D story about moths turning to butterflies with wonderful special effects, then off to the conservatory to mingle with the butterflies. They are mixed with Chiluly glassworks",
          "I took granddaughter to see, she had chosen! Well she\u2019s afraid of bugs....so that\u2019s a clue to future families that have kidos scared that even butterflies can cause a meltdown and wanting to leave so think thru before you schedule! That said, I managed to calm her a tad so I",
          "We just arrived in time for the release of butterflies. The attendant had us go right into the butterfly area so we could watch this event. It was a great experience to watch. all the children being excited along with us old adults. I have been there previously and was in awe",
          "The Butterfly Wonderland was absolutely amazing! The 3D show was amazing! They had an observatory that you walked in with 2,000-3,000 butterflies! They would just land on people. It was a great time and definitely something worth seeing!",
          "I am not sure if I would go not as a family to this spot, but we enjoyed it so much and spent at least an hour or more just with the butterflies :)",
          "I\u2019m not a huge fan of butterflies but I decided to come here with my best friend since she was in town and we needed to do some \u201ctouristy things\u201d. They offered military discount which was nice! We went in and watched a 3D short film about the life cycle of a bitterly before we",
          "On a recent sojourn to the OdySea in the Desert complex in Scottsdale, I took my wife to see Butterfly Wonderland. This is my second visit, and this facility just keeps getting better! Featuring more than 3000 live butterflies, Butterfly Wonderland markets itself as the largest",
          "If one does not mind the humidity inside the 'garden', it's a lovely place to come up close and personal with some lovely butterflies. They fly around you, and sometimes even land on you, be prepared it may happen if they like your smell.",
          "I went into this place with a bad attitude, mostly because of the $75 spent for three of us to get in. It was interesting and peaceful. The butterflies are everywhere, they\u2019ll even land on you. It\u2019s geared more towards younger kids but still interesting enough for adults.",
          "Visited because of the positive reviews but i was really disappointed. For the price you see a fifteen min video, then you are shuffled into an area to see butterflies coming from their cacoon and then you are sent to the butterfly exhibit. While it was good to get some",
          "We arrived early and were rewarded with less crowding. There were two butterflies breaking out of their chrysalis's which we were able to watch for over 15 minutes. Patience is needed in the Conservatory, most patrons walk thru/around relatively quickly. But you will be rewarded",
          "Our entire family had a wonderful day at Butterfly Wonderland! It is a great place for all ages. The exhibits were beautiful. The staff is so knowledgeable. Gary made our experience there so amazing with the amount of facts and interesting stories. The passion of nature was",
          "Yoga in the butterfly exhibit Is definitely worth it!! I would try it out at least once the butterflies es are so pretty",
          "My sister and brother-in-law treated me to a visit to Butterfly Wonderland while I was visiting them. Our group consisted of 3 adults and 2 children, 5 and 3. We all had a wonderful time. We had some extra entertainment as it was the Hungry Hungry Caterpillar's birthday when we",
          "Fun visit with my daughter who wanted to visit for a few years. Staff was amazing, very knowledgeable.. Super experience in the conservatory with plants and of course, the butterflies. Patience is a virtue so I tried to wait for a butterfly go open his wings for that perfect",
          "I visited Butterfly Wonderland on Sunday morning with my cousins and their little ones. We had a fantastic time! I easily could have spent the entire day there wandering around gazing at everything. The 3D movie shown before you enter the facility is beautifully done, and pays",
          "The variety of butterflies is amazing. One is able to see many butterflies of astonishing color pattern and size. The only drawbacks are the large crowd permitted into the enclosure at one time and the heavy heat and humidity. Notwithstanding, the wonderland is worth the",
          "Beautiful butterflies, flowers, and lots to see. The butterflies are truly amazing! The color and size and detail you are able to see is fantastic. No where else could you see that many different butterflies. The down side is the cost. For two adults it was over $50. My",
          "After a quick 3-D movie they release you into the butterfly sanctuary and you\u2019re surrounded by beautiful butterflies and moths that may even land on you and are fluttering all around. Lots of variety and educational info... be prepared for LOTS of kids.",
          "This was a nice reprieve from the 100 degree afternoon in Scottsdale. Kids enjoyed the butterflies as well as the other exhibits of reptiles and fish. The 3D butterfly movie (15 minutes long) was also pretty cool. That being said, $86 for a family of 4 seems pretty steep.",
          "This place is amazing! Very educational and beautiful place to spend a few hours. The butterfly exhibit has thousands of butterflies. There are even small exhibits of fish, lizards and insects. My 4 year old loved the 3D movie and we spent about 3 hours here. We only left",
          "This was our 2nd visit to Butterfly Wonderland, and it was just as exciting as the first time. We enjoyed it so much that we went back later in the day (admission lasts until closing). It is so serene and magical to be surrounded by these beautiful creatures. If you stand",
          "This is a great family place to visit, for those of all ages--baby through senior. We come often. You begin with a 3D movie of the life cycle of a monarch butterfly, proceed to the Emergent Room (where we saw two butterflies hatch out of their chrysalids yesterday!!!!), and",
          "This is a fabulous place to bring friends and family alike! If you are afraid of butterflies this place is not for you. But the butterflies are gentle they would never harm you and you learn so much from beginning to end of a life of a butterfly. Enjoy the film at the very",
          "The kids have a great time with all of butterflies around them and the flowers are at the correct height for them to see the butterflies at work. Many other exhibits to see. You must park all strollers.",
          "Took the kids ages 5 and 9. Not much to see after standing out in the butterfly area. Seems too expensive for what you get. Typical tourist trap.",
          "If you like flowers and butterflies this is the place to see. Great multigenerational activity easy walking unless heat and humidity bothers a medical condition (80s high humidity in tropical greenhouse). Reptile exhibit addition since we last visited a nice touch also.",
          "This isn\u2019t something to spend hours in, but I found it to be well worth the visit! I thought I knew about the monarch migration, but I learned so much in the movie they show before you enter the exhibit! (And I\u2019m definitely planting milkweed in the garden this year!) The staff",
          "if you love nature and especially butterflies you will love this place.Butterflies will be all over you and if you going with kids they will not want to leave this place. This place is not that big so you will be able to visit this and other attractions that are next to it in",
          "I loved this place. My friend and I spent a couple of hours just in the Butterfly Wonderland alone. There are real beauties there. You'll discover not just butterflies but a couple of free range chickens and a big Koi pond too. It was wonderful. Watch your step!!! Don't",
          "I loved the experience! I will say I think adults and very young children are the ones who enjoy it the most. My niece and nephew are 9 and 10 and they ran through pretty fast. They liked the movie but got bored in the butterfly room. They did become engaged when a worker",
          "Family of 6-boys 7 and 9, parents, and gparents 75 years old. Loved by all! Would recommend for 1-2 hours",
          "It is very pricey for what it is. Nice room of butterflys less than 10 minutes. Just not my cup of tea. Price should not be separate.",
          "Visited while on Spring Break with family. Bought combo tickets to visit the aquarium and mirror maze as well. For what it's worth, very expensive in my opinion. We loved the 3d video on the butterfly and the garden is absolutely beautiful! Thing is, it is so small. On a not",
          "When we left my grandson said \u201cit was the BEST day of my life!\u201d. Need I say more. It was truly magical!",
          "Although I would not recommend as a couple without children/grandchildren going on a Saturday morning, this attraction was wonderful. It was the only time we had, and we are glad that we didn\u2019t miss it on our rare trip to the Phoenix area. The butterflies were amazing. We",
          "We've been to several butterly pavilions and this one remains our favorite when visiting Phoenix (this was our fourth time). We went on a rainy day and so, it seemed, did everyone else. Despite the large number of visitors it didn't seem too crowded and everyone was respectful",
          "Unfortunately, we visited on a day with a large field trip which also had rain. They were not equipped for the crowds. The field trip kids made it an unenjoyable experience for. They talked loudly during the movie, we had to wait for them to all file in for the movie to start",
          "This place is cool. A little expensive but we had a blast. Besides the beautiful butterflies, there was a phenomenal aquarium that included small sharks and stingrays. Grandma and Henry also had an opportunity to feed. There was so many fun things for both children and adults.",
          "Butterfly Wonderland is part of the OdySea complex so arrive early so you will have time to see more than just the butterflies. When you enter you are treated to a 3D movie about Monarch butterflies. Afterwards you enter the conservatory. Here you get to walk in with the",
          "Remarkable place to take your children or grandchildren. What an experience to understand the majesty of life.",
          "This is part of a larger complex including the aquarium and dolphin show. Allow yourself a full day to see everything. It is all fairly new and is lots of fun. the kiddos will love it,",
          "This is the first butterfly house I have ever been to so I have nothing to compare it with. However, I thought it was just magical! There were over 3000 butterflies in the area where you could walk around and I have never seen so many beautiful butterflies in my life, there were",
          "I LOVED this place! We were searching for indoor activities, since it was raining in Phoenix for a couple of days during our stay. Because of the rain, the butterflies are not as active, and we received a discount on our entry. The plants and flowers were exquisite, and perfect",
          "Went to this museum fully anticipating that there would be tons of butterflies flying around in their enclosed exhibit. Well we saw one butterfly in flight. We had to search and find looking under branches and leaves. The only thing that we found of interest was the 15",
          "From the 3D movie with butterflies up close, to the live cocoon transformation showcase, excitement builds to be entranced by the magnificent butterfly frenzy surrounded by lush plants, stunning flowers & a water feature with Koi fish. So many beautiful vibrant coloured species",
          "We loved this place. We spent at least an hour with the butterflies under the big beautiful glass canopy. Many very pretty species.....you'll probably be most attracted to the blue ones. Wear a bright printed shirt, especially an Aloha shirt, and you may attract a butterfly",
          "This is a very nice butterfly exhibit with a large variety of butterflies. They also have a few reptiles and amphibians here. Your visit starts with a short movie then you see the emerging butterfly area. Your last stop is the actual butterfly exhibit where you can stay as long",
          "We took my mothr-in-law to see the Butterfly Wonderland on a recent Tues. afternoon.....we were impressed about how big it was, as well as being staffed by educated & personable people",
          "After enjoying the awesome Butterfly Wonderland it was lunchtime. We had delicious, huge hot dogs, chips and drinks. Their desserts are wonderful. I would go back just to have one of their hot dogs!",
          "If you love butterflies, then this place is filled you. There are butterflies everywhere you go, so many of them. You will see them in all colors, shapes and sizes. The kids will have a great time chasing after all the butterflies, sometimes they get treated to a butterfly",
          "They say that they have more than 10,000 different types of butterflies in the main exhibit which is climate controlled and a little bit too warm for my taste. However, there were thousands of butterflies flying around among the flowers and the spectacle was beautiful.",
          "Very nice visit with my children. It\u2019s a little pricey for the size, we pay more than $80 for 4 people, but we all love the butterfly space. The other 3 exhibitions are very small, I hope with time those get bigger! We didn\u2019t go to the aquarium next door. It would be nice if",
          "Beautiful butterflies. Very nice to see and would go back again. Prices are high but overall it is worth your money. A++",
          "Ok, first it is pricey $25 each basically... but certainly lots to see. Reptiles and some marine life to see too.",
          "We had gone to the Butterfly Wonderland earlier and found it a very educational and enjoyable experience. We had purchased tickets enabling us to come back as desired during the year. We did not realize that in addition to the capacity to return with our grandchildren, we",
          "We were surprised how much we enjoyed this outing. You learn so much about the history of butterflies and migration patterns of the monarchs and then to see caterpillars in there just station phase was amazing. And once we entered the actual butterfly garden and it was so",

          "We took an afternoon of our trip to visit. It was absolutely worth it. The butterflies were beautiful! The staff were very educated about butterflies- their life cycles & how to just leave them fly so we don't harm them. I was very impressed! Highly recommend to stop here if you",

          "This year we took the entire family, which included a 2 year old, and everyone had a great time. You start out with a 3-D video that shows the life of a butterfly. Then you go through a room which has cocoons, where you can actually watch butterfly's hatching if you are lucky.",

          "Yes, I was forced to go here. I spent a lot of money to get in for a short time visit. Unless you want to sit on a bench in butterfly room it will not take much time to see this place. Yes it\u2019s cool but for how long. You see a 3D movie before you see butterflies. You will also",
          "We did this as a package deal with Odysea aquarium. Probably wouldn\u2019t have gone if it wasn\u2019t for the aquarium. As a package deal this was great. Friendly staff, relatively clean and of course lots of butterflies! Also had some fish and reptiles. Great place for kids",
          "The boys (aged 10 & 14) we\u2019re beyond fascinated\u2014we had to agree. There were baby birds in the area too that kept their attention. The butterflies were everywhere and everyone was so respectful of their presence. There\u2019s a nice film to watch that keeps it brief but explains so",

You can enjoy the garden at your own pace, spend as much time as you like. Fantastic photo opportunities. Just watch your",
          "This was such a fun place to explore. I learned so much about butterflies. Being able to walk around with upwards of 3000 of them was one of the coolest things I have done. They also had awesome plants and water features in the green house.",
          "I never imagined that there could be a place such as this. It truly was like something out of a movie! You literally had to be careful of where you walked, as you didn't want to accidentally step on a butterfly! Butterflies were EVERYWHERE...and there were probably a couple",

          "I just loved this place. It's the kind of place where you can just relax and forget about everything. The beauty that these butterflies have are lovely to see and there are so many of them everywhere flying all around you. And the 3D movie was fun too.",
          "My 4.5 year old daughter loved the amazing butterfly pavilion as well as the small aquarium and the great 3-d movie about monarch butterflies. It made for a great afternoon of family fun, and we'd definitely visit again in the future. My only complaint is that it's very",
          "What an amazing place. At first I was thinking $23 to see butterflies are you kidding me? But after spending a couple hours inside this magical place, it was well worth every penny. We arrived shortly after they opened at 9 on a cool Friday and started our visit with a short",
          "A neat spot but ticket prices aren\u2019t cheap. The 3d video was very informative. Moving into the Butterfly area- Seemed like the butterflies were more attracted to light colors so if you have kids & they are excited to have a butterfly land on them plan accordingly. My 4 year old",
          "Went with four adults and a three year old child. Movie detailing the migration of the Monarch butterflies in 3D was exceptionally good. The butterfly area is interesting with such a variety and number of butterflies everywhere. However, found it was captivating for an hour",

          "We enjoyed this so much!! Lovely butterflies everywhere. So beautiful and serene. The pond with Koi fish so nice. The short 3D film on Monarchs was amazing.",
          "I was mesmerized by the video about the migration of the Monarch, but going into the conservatory with over 4,000 butterflies - I couldn't believe the colors, sizes, shapes, etc. of all the butterflies. It was fantastic, and so beautiful. Worth several trips there.",
          "A magical wonderland of beauty! This place is for all ages, staff knowledgeable and very friendly. I could have lived there forever so peaceful.",
          "The only thing about Butterfly Wonderland I didn't like was how expensive it was (almost $20 for one adult) other than that it is beautiful in there with so so many butterflies and moths to see. It was here that I had a Blue Morpho land on me and stay with me for awhile and",
          "Lovely place for a family to visit! If you want lots of butterflies to land on you. Wear white, light color clothing. Butterflies are attracted to bright colors as opposed to dark colors.",
          "Love the butterfly area. Tons of wonderful butterflies and an enchanted garden feel. Everyone in the family loved it. The other areas (reptiles, fish) are just OK. The real draw is the butterfly area and I want to go back soon.",
          "We spent about 1.5-2 hours here. Very nice and interesting for all ages. We watched the 3-D movie. It was 15 minutes long, free and worth the time. When you first enter the area with the live butterflies, they don't seem to come very close, but after you've been there",

          "I was not expecting to be so thoroughly entertained at a butterfly museum! An outstanding presentation! The movie was amazing, the special effects made it seem as if butterflies were floating in front of your face. I think I preferred this to Odysea to tell the truth.",

          "this place was absolutely AMAZING.  they are super informative with everything and I learned soo much about butterflies and how some barely survive due to crops and their abilities to maintain survival. this was a truly remarkable experience.",

          "The place was a smug expensive. Staff were a delight. \n1. The butterfly sanctuary was hot and humid. I wish they would have lent out colorful scarfs. So the butterfly would land on us. \n2. The video was out of place. I felt like they were \u2026",
          "This place is amazing!! If you want the butterflies to land on you or follow you wear a red or orange shirt. I've gone twice now and both colors seem to really attract them. Do not out these colors on a small child it could scare them or cause them to smash the butterflies.",
          "I just visited this afternoon, and did not have a good experience. I was rudely blocked coming out of the Butterfly Conservatory. The attendant had her hand on the exit door and said I could not come out. She did not explain why and would \u2026",
          "An absolute go-to for a place to just relax and enjoy the moment!  Great little rain forest, koi pond, and beautiful butterflies everywhere! The reptiles seem well cared for as well, which is immensely important to me. I have an annual pass and I love it!",
          "This is a fun place to take the kids.  They like walking around with all the butterflies and watching the movie.  We got yearly passes because of that.  Now when my girls are home from school, we have a place we can go and spend a little time.  Definitely worth at least one visit.",
          "Driven by for 5 years and decided to go when driving by with my sweetheart.   Such an amazing experience!!",
          "Great place to observe nature, and how can you not be fascinated or not love Butterflies?",

          "Such a wonderful place.  I was able to buy the tickets online so that saved us the time at the window. The movie they make everyone watch was truly amazing - I am glad I saw it.   The staff is helpful and the grounds are beautiful.  Loved \u2026",

          "A beautiful exhibit that you must take your time to take it all in. Every corner hid new sights to see full of butterflies, frogs and the wondering chickens. This place is a must for anyone looking to take some great photos. It is well \u2026",
          "Amazing...fun and educational visit for 2-3 hours.  The giant sculpture of the caterpillar in the court yard is so adorable.  The 3D movie, flight of the butterflies, is amazing.  The wow feature is the display of various butterflies' \u2026",
          "Fairytale worthy. One of my favorite places in the world. Hope to take the kids someday. Made our trip!",
          "My kids (8 and 3) loved it. It's really warm inside so bring clothing that allows you to strip yourself or the kids down. We went in long sleeves and pants the first time and we were burning up due to the environment/temperature needed for \u2026",
          "The butterfly portion was a little bit smaller than I expected [I'd never been to one before and apparently this one is actually quite large], but was really beautiful and there was a lot of information available. We combined our tickets \u2026",
          "This place is amazing for all family\u2019s I spent hours in the butterfly exhibit you can go into a cage where all the butterflies thrive and grow and live you get to be apart of there ecosystem.  they also have a cool 3D movie before you enter the butterfly dome.",
          "Great and very fun place. We had a great time.",
          "A little pricey but it's not often you get to be in the midst of that many butterflies! So many that they even land on you. The 3D movie about the monarch migration is very good.",
          "This was a very cool and informative place to take my 4 yr old grandson... he loved it!",
          "Really fun place. My wife recommended that we go here and with no expectations it turned into one of the funnest things we did on our vacation. Incredible to see the life cycle of butterflies and even more enjoyable to watch them land on you.",
          "Repeat visitor here.  Had family visiting and we all went.  It is a wonderful place.  You can tell all the animals are friendly and well cared for.   The butterfly conservatory is the best part you can wander around for a while and of course all the butterflies are beautiful.  The whole museum is great.",
          "Very good place to spend with children. Children will like it most enjoyable. The entrance tickets are very nominal and the collection they have is enarmous. It's a treat for butterfly enthusiast's. The food options around the place is also plenty. Overall a beautiful place to spend time. Must try once.",
          "We had lots of fun here! The main butterfly exhibit room was amazing. The butterfly exhibit area was built to be like a beautiful natural outdoor habitat for the hundreds, maybe thousands, of butterfly species. There\u2019s definitely no \u2026",
          "Great place. My son liked it. It was very humid in with the butterflies so be aware of that.",
          "It was a good movie and walk through.  There are a ton of butterdlies.  If you wear white they are likely to land on you.  Goft store had great stuff too.",
          "Omg what an unbelievable experience.  Yes you can park your Motorhome n tow in parking lot.  Got there about 12:00pm.  When we went to leave it was almost 5pm.  Couldn't believe how the time flew.",

          "We took the guided tour today and it was so much fun to get the extra details, help with a butterfly release, go behind the scenes and get to feed the sting ray and shark.  \n\nThe 3D movie is really cool and the butterfly sanctuary puts you \u2026",
          "The butterfly exhibit was smaller than anticipated, when looking at the cost. The butterfly area is very warm and humid prepare to sweat.",
          "So many amazing butterflies and other wonderous animals. Seeing rare creatures and learning about the life cycle of butterfly's is such a fun and enjoyable experience.\n\nThey say that if you visit and 5 butterfly's land on you, you will have good luck!",
          "Very nice people working there and a clean environment for the butterflies! Didn't see the chickens, which was the only downside. Enjoyed the video! The man at the reptile area was SUPER knowledgeable about the reptiles, and that is now my favorite part of the exhibit!",
          "Nice facility. Extremely expensive for what it is in my opinion",
          "Amazing and beautiful! So many wonderful species in a warm (not hot) greenhouse like enclosure. Plenty of space to move around and the butterflies land right on you!",
          "Really great exhibits for grade school aged children.  Nice escape from Arizona heat.  Not too big where kids will get board quickly.  A bit expensive but can reduce cost with Costco gift card.  Highly recommend for families looking for something to do in the area.",
          "It's a nice place to visit albeit pricey.  I took my 5 year old and 12 year old and they enjoyed it. We were finished in less than 2 hours.",
          "Spectacular. Was there during my trip in AZ - staff was friendly! Then I made a little buddy who sat on my shoulder for 30 mins. Definitely would go back \u2728\ud83e\uddda\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
          "Absolutely fantastic! Take your time to walk through multiple times. The butterflies obviously move around a lot, if you just walk through quick one time you won't see much. They have an amazing number of stunning butterflies and moths. Bonus, check out the vending machine in the insect room.",
          "Great place to go and see some butterflies. If you spend enough time in the room, some of them even land on you. A very fun experience and a great place to bring your kids and family. The workers are all very nice and informative as well.",
          "Nature is the ultimate art. Coming from an inspired artist. Thanks for the experience.",

          "Great place. Hundreds and hundreds of butterflies flying around. Just Awesome..",
          "Beautiful rain forest setting. You can learn more about Monarch Buterflies by watching a 3D movie (free with admission). Many varieties of butterflies in the Conservatory. They also have a fascinating reptile room.Great day for adults and kids. A bit pricey but well worth it. Search for discounts.",
          "My husband and I became a member at the beginning of July and it has become my favorite place to escape to. I enjoy the beauty, sanctuary, and the peaceful lives of the butterflies.\nI want to thank Bonnie and Rachel for all they did to make \u2026",
          "AMAZING! The whole experience was very engaging. I had doubts about going because it was just my husband and I, but it was so mesmerizing. The butterflies, birds, and moths were very active. I would recommend asking the specialists \u2026",
          "Had so much fun with my daughter!",
          "My family and I (wife, three children ages 1, 5, 8 and parents) went here and enjoyed our experience. It was pricey, and there wasn\u2019t a ton to see, but plenty of visually appealing butterflies and a 3-d movie to keep the kiddos entertained for a couple of hours. Would recommend!",
          "Went here on a field trip with my kiddo. It was fun and super informational. I liked that you could tour on your own. If you like butterflies best, then stick around there for a half hour; if you like reptiles best, then spend more time \u2026",
          "Beautiful place. Very fun. Just a warm environment... lol",
          "No where in my life have I seen these many different types of butterflies all in one place. It's truly beautiful.",
          "All Eric Carle\u2019s themed including the restrooms. This is appealing to all ages. They have the 3D informational video about the monarch butterfly which was awesome! The display with so many cocoons hatching right there in front of you was \u2026",
          "Wonderland doesn't begin to describe it!  It is not a quick, inexpensive outing but it is definitely worth every penny!  We were amazed watching live caterpillars wiggling and butterflies actually working their way into the world right \u2026",
          "One of the best kept secrets in all of the valley. I run photo meet ups and we go here a lot.",
          "Good experience overall. My 4 year old daughter loved it. I wish it was a little less expensive. There are groupons but it only saves you a couple dollars not a huge savings. Overall I would recommend it to others.",
          "Have been to other butterfly exhibits, but this was was pretty cool, starts off with a movie and history- moves into larvae room and then into the atrium.  Now it is hot and humid in there so be prepared! But the grounds are well kept and \u2026",
          "Such an amazing experience! More then just butterflies at the Butterfly Wonderland  we also saw stingrays and  reptiles. As you enter they offer you to get a bracelet so you could leave the building and still come back to see the butterflies before heading home.",
          "Butterflies were cooler than I expected, and they had a fishes spot and jungle animals and bugs spot after you exit the butterfly area.   I enjoyed the visit",
          "What a great place to visit. We really enjoyed ourselves today and plan on going back",
          "We just arrived in time for the release of butterflies. The attendant had us go right into the butterfly area so we could watch this event. It was a great experience to watch. all the children being excited along with us old adults. I have \u2026",
          "Great place to appreciate the beauty and diversity of butterflies. When a butterfly landed on a little girl's dress, she was so happy it was incredibly adorable. Great to see families bring their kids and they have a blast.",
          "A very pleasant experience, so much to learn and embrace.  The staff is so very informative and helpful.  The reptiles are amazing and we had the most fantastic time.  My only complaint is that they tell you NOT to touch the butterflies and \u2026",
          "I took my grandson to critters and crafts at Butterfly Wonderland and we had a blast! Miss Vicky the lead person, was so great with the kids...engaging and fun! For the craft, the kids made handprint hermit crabs...so clever and adorable! \u2026",
          "Highly disappointed def will not be back there was such a waste of money  no where close to 3000 butterflys like they advertise  only took maybe 20 minutes to see everything will not recommend this place at all the only 1 star goes to the very informative lady that talks about the butterflys before you actually go to see them",
          "This place is so beautiful and educational. The staff is knowledgeable and pleasant. Purchasing tickets at the window took longer than expected. We started with the 3D movie and it was great. They have a room were you get to see the \u2026",
          "This place is seriously awesome and beautiful. I could have spent the whole day in with the butterflies. We had a fantastic time.",
          "Enjoyed the 3D video to start the process before entering the butterfly enclosure. There was a young man who was very informative on the butterflies and letting us know why you should not touch them. I liked the fact that they had pages of \u2026",
          "Great place for kids. My wifes favorite place. Lose your stress and go play with the butterflies",
          "Love the butterflies! The reptile exhibit is amazing also. The butterfly exhibit is humid, but it's understandable why! I love the cocoon exhibit! Fun for the whole family.",
          "Had a really good time. Would not say it is for little kids that are afraid of bugs or flying insects. They land and fly all over and you have to be careful not to step on them.",
          "I really enjoyed our visit! It was very educational, and the butterflies are just fantastic. If you've never been before, I recommend taking the time to watch the 3d movie. My family ranges from adult to teenager to preteen to preschooler \u2026",
          "Really great day with the family here! Even easy to visit when it's hot outside. They keep the butterfly area temperature regulated. There is also an area to view with fish, reptiles, etc.",
          "It's good for kids and small children",
          "For the conservation efforts, they are good. But there is false advertising going on here. They say that they're the largest in North America, but Magic Wings in Greenfield, MA is larger, both in terms of area and in the number of species. \u2026",
          "My wife and I went here for Father's Day. We were debating here or the aquarium but wanted to try something new. A great time was had by all! It was really something to be in the enclosure being surrounded by butterflies and having the \u2026",

          "My family and I came here and had a great time. It was beautiful.",
          "The conservatory itself is beautiful, and the butterflies are gorgeous. The only real problem I wouldn't call a problem exactly. I expected the conservatory to be bigger, it is kind of small, but honestly it's a wonderful place. They \u2026",
          "We had a very nice time learning about butterflies. It was great to see the newly emerged butterflies and then to go into the  conservatory where butterflies flew all around us! Tip: wear a brightly colored shirt to have them light on you.",
          "Nice place has some good restaurants and the kids like it.",
          "I grew up in a place which were populated with butterfly. This place took me to my childhood. The imax 3D movie on monarch butterfly migration was awesome. Watch it from 3rd or 4th row from screen for full 3D effects.",
          "I took my grandson to the odyssey aquarium! We had a beautiful time! Highly recommended!",
          "Thus place is beyond beautiful. My son had such an amazing experience here. He learned so much about butterfly evolution. He was just so amazed by the variety of butterflies they have. Everyone was so nice as well. Favorite part, the 3d video it's so cool.",

          "You will love this place...young or old, it's a great experience.",
          "We loved our visit here. There were beautiful butterflies fluttering around everywhere you look. It was comfortable in the enclosure on a hot summer day too with the misters all around. Enjoyed the huge colorful glass artwork plus a koi \u2026",
          "This was a blast! We brought our professional cameras and spent a couple hours! You could have just as much fun with your phones camera. It was, however,  ridiculously hot. It's a greenhouse so take the outside temperature and add humidity. Our friend is from Georgia and he said it felt just like home.",
          "Love it here so much to do. Been to the Aquarium, Pangea and no complaints. They always have free events to attend. Kids love it and are always excited to go here. Next day planned here is the lazer mirror tag and the butterfly emporium. This place is a.most if you got little ones",
          "Beautiful place to visit beautiful Garden",
          "It\u2019s such a beautiful place",

          "A great way to spend an afternoon",
          "This is an ideal place to take your family, friends or out of towners. There are so many other activities here as well to accomdate anyone piqued intrests. Around the facility there is also  adult attractions like the polar bar or the \u2026",
          "The place is nice for a special occasion, maybe some good pictures. The prices are, well, pricey, and nothing is too special. Beware, the food court is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE, and despite the regulations, it's better to bring your own food.",
          "Great place to spend a day with your kids.Quite enjoyable for adults also.",
          "Pleasant staff. You can spend as much time there as you want\n And other attractions are nearby",
          "Not worth the $25 price.\n\nThe exhibit itself is neat to see. It is small, and can be walked through in 5 minutes. It would be nice to sit in for a bit and enjoy, if you do not have little ones to attend too. \n\nIf you have younger than 3 \u2026",
          "Very calming and peaceful environment :)",
          "One of my favorite places.\n If you haven't been there be sure to go.\nTheir memorial ceiling is one of my favorite ways to remember a loved one.",

          "Did not expect much but ended up leaving with an annual pass. At the door we were greeted by Bonnie who made us feel like we were family. Then we met Jasmine. She is the reason we decided to get the annual passes. Thanks also to the rest of the staff that we met, sorry I cant remember all of your names.",
          "The habitat is small but it's pretty. Expensive too",
          "Very cool.  Little pricey but nice.   Cool movie to start off that explains the butterfly path.   Worth it at least once.",
          "The garden itself is the main attraction. There are around 2000 butterflies at any given time flying around. Very pretty display and well tended garden. If you're patient and still enough a butterfly might even land on you. \n\nI give it four \u2026",
          "It's really fun and engaging. We took a lot of pictures. I mean A LOT! The 3d documentary on monarch butterflies was cool. I know the story but the 3d put you right in it. Nice touch. The subtle message that man is destroying their habitat \u2026",
          "Great place for family and friends to enjoy a nice day of fulfillment and wonder!",

          "Amazing! Lots of butterflies landing on people.",
          "The butterflies are amazing, and it's awesome to see so many different kinds in one place. It was super humid because that's what butterflies need, but I would not recommend spending to much time in there in the summer. They did a beautiful job setting up the inside, and the gift shop with local honey was awesome. I would love to return.",
          "This is a great place to go for an oasis in the desert. We took our girls, 2 and 1, and they had a great time. There is a 3D movie which was really fun and the butterfly garden is spectacular. If you go early enough you can even ask to feed the koi. Some other animals and fish to see inside as well with nice exhibits.",
          "Went about a week ago in the early afternoon...no clouds. Plenty of active butterflies of all sorts of colors and sizes.  Some will even land on you in the sanctuary area.  There was am aquarium and reptile area but felt like toss-ins. \u2026",
          "The highlight of Butterfly Wonderland is the conservatory where you can walk around and see hundreds of butterflies landing on people and on the bushes and trees. You will view a video first on the monarch migration when you go in and then \u2026",

          "A small butterfly filled area, extremely hot and humid! Small cafeteria. A small area with a few aquariums and a tank containing sting rays- NOT a touch tank. Another small area of species of the rain forest. A very short 3D movie. Staff was not overly friendly. Absolutely NOT worth the price.",
          "Took my sister daughter here for the first time and it's amazing and beautiful place to take kids to enjoy.",
          "This place is so beautiful a wonderland. I just wish the exhibits for the reptiles enclosure was much bigger and the had more space to run round. It is their home. There is so much that be utilized in the facility that can accommodate the \u2026",
          "Very cool place. Recommend wearing bright colors, or maybe even a hat, as the butterflies really seem to be attracted to the bright colors. So if you want them to land on you, wear something bright. It is a bit pricey considering it is not all the big, but it is an Excellent experience.",
          "Butterfly Wonderland is a great place of children -- and adults. Well- organized in a larger, netted greenhouse of sorts, there is a great variety of butterflies living in close-to-natural environments. Butterflies aren't exactly tame -- \u2026",

          "Little pricey but the experiences are good and all the animals look healthy and clean.",
          "Loved it here! It was much better than I expected. You start off with a 3D short film about the monarch butterflies and then get to view the chrysallis. If you're lucky you may see one hatch. The butterflies are then taken to the \u2026",
          "Took my daughter here for her 10th birthday! It was truly an amazing experience with her.",
          "I absolutely loved everything about my visit. Kind and knowledgeable staff. Absolutely stunning butterflies.",
          "Butterfly Wonderland is a hit place among kids even elders will enjoy it. Well maintained, clean, safe, huge parking lots, complementary face tattoo on entrance. The prices are reasonable. First time visit is a memorable one. They show a 3D \u2026",
          "The butterflies are beautiful, however the overall facility is a little dated.  I think if the butterfly atrium was expanded and fixtures, painting, water features updated.  The owners would see a lot more traffic.  Because, everyone loves butterflies.",
          "Excellent! Came all the way from TX to see. Loved the film",
          "Nice learning experience.",
          "From the 3D movie with butterflies up close, to the live cocoon transformation showcase, excitement builds to be entranced by the magnificent butterfly frenzy surrounded by lush plants, stunning flowers & a water feature with Koi fish. So \u2026",

          "Fun, exciting & educational.",
          "Much more than just a Butterfly exhibit. You start off with a great, informative, 3D movie that teaches all about the Monarch Butterfly. Next there's the conservatory that houses thousands of butterflies. There is also a small exhibition of \u2026",
          "The butterflies were neat and my daughter liked it but for about 5 min. Then she was done. For 25 dollars for adults yikes. I think we had more fun eating at the dinosaur grill close by.  Would not recommend unless it child is in love with butterflies.",
          "Great place for a perfect afternoon with kids.",
          "Very much enjoyed my time at this place. There were lots of butterflies to see and I highly recommend a visit.",

          "A wonderful time all the butterflies were so beautiful",
          "I've lived here in Arizona off and on for 20 years, and have never been here. I guess you could say I pick and choose, and I really didn't want to come here today, but my sister insisted. I can honestly say, I liked it. You actually get to \u2026",
          "Looked more like butterfly's were not in much opened environment. Couldn't touch and or feed with a cotton tip not really a good experience could of been better. The guy who did the 3d movie screening was cool and made it a great \u2026",
          "Magical. Educational. Beautiful. Peaceful. Have your phone well charged! You will be taking pictures and video nonstop! \nI can't wait to go again!",
          "It was a lot of fun here, the butterflies are everywhere, and will even land on you",
          "Kids had fun. Not something we will do more than once a year.",
          "Fun place for the whole family, lovely staff!",
          "Really nice location to visit, always interesting and very calming. I wasn't expecting that the first time I went. The 3d short film about the migration of butterflies was really well done.",
          "This is the best place around to photograph butterflies. It is also a great place to relax.",
          "The tour is simple and laid out well. It is an easy and enjoyable walk though. I loved the 3d movie as well as the butterfly exhibit.",
          "After enjoying the awesome Butterfly Wonderland it was lunchtime.  We had delicious, huge hot dogs, chips and drinks.  Their desserts are wonderful. I would go back just to have one of their hot dogs.",
          "We love it there! My 2 and 4 year olds begs to go daily and my 7 year old loved it too. I would also love to go sometime just to enjoy it without kiddos. Fun for all ages",

          "I enjoyed the peacefulness there. The 3D video was really cool.",
          "It's very hot inside and half of the butterflies are dying. There was also more moths than butterflies. They have a bee hive, and they also have like 6 chickens running around. The statues are nice to look at.",
          "I bring my grandchildren here.  I am still fascinated every time I go.",
          "Lovely place.  Glad I went. Loved the education and activities.  Reason not a 5 is because I'd love if they would change out exhibits, movies.  Got a lot of value from the people educating but could only think of my own questions. Snack bar reasonable prices",
          "Great place to visit with the family. Nice they have the aquarium and dino attractions in the same complex",
          "Do you like SCIENCE & Butterflys??  No, well Im not talking to you then.  This place is incredible.  I took my niece here and she wants to be a scientist when she grows up and I really feel like this place added fuel to her future scientist fire.",

          "Absolutely wonderful exhibit, 3D movie,  and displays. The buttferflies are so beautiful.",
          "Not handicapped friendly to say nothing of accessible. Not worth it. Time better spent out of the city hiking.",
          "It was amazing!! There are so many butterflies that are just flying around",
          "It was cool in a \"go once in a lifetime\" way. Not cool enough to go back. Their cafe didnt have cold fountain drinks or ice. You sweat hardcore in the butterfly area and then cant get any cold drink whatsoever.",
          "Loved it! Worth every penny!",
          "Always a magical experience! We avoid it during the hot summer months but it really is a cool place to go!",
          "This place is truly a wonderland with beautiful butterflies that carelessly flit and flutter all about you! The foliage is amazing, and the koi pond is just mesmerizing. Definitely worth the trip to go and behold.",
          "Nice place but a little overpriced.",
          "After enjoying the awesome Butterfly Wonderland it was lunchtime.  We had delicious, huge hot dogs, chips and drinks.  Their desserts are wonderful. I would go back just to have one of their hot dogs.",
          "So educational very nice and clean",

          "Awesome to be up close to many butterflies. Great place to take all ages.",
          "Very informative 3-D movie that is entertain and educational. 60 species of butterflies in atrium garden and great honeycomb bee  display. Unique experience for both 92 year old mom and I.  Not enough places to sit and definitely not \u2026",
          "I loved visiting and seeing the butterflies!",
          "Best I've ever seen. Can see ALL stages in the butterflies development",

          "So much fun to see all the beautiful butterflies!",
          "Its so neat the butterflies land all over.",
          "It was beautiful. And everyone who worked there seemed to really enjoy it and had been very knowledgeable. Thought it would be a little longer of a tour but all in all it was a great family day. Had a Groupon so it was a few bucks cheaper as well.",
          "Where were all the butterflies?? The intro movie about the monarchs was nice, but the actual exhibit was a real let down. I counted a grand total of 11 butterflies in the greenhouse, and most were of the same species. They lead you to \u2026",
          "Very cool place but WAY too expensive for the limited experience it is.",
          "This was a really cool experience my kids and I had.   They had all kinds of exotic butterflies.   It was well worth the money.",
          "Great exhibits; took about 90minutes in all. Sad to see the sting ray pool is now no touch. The koi pond is my favorite. I wish the lifetime and annual memberships included a discount on tickets. The Lifetime membership is well worth the \u2026",
          "Grandchild had a blast. At one point she had more than 20 butterflies landed on her.",
          "It's really really cute. But there isn't a lot to do for the money you pay to get in",
          "So neat to see..so many beautiful butterflies and glass art. .could have stayed all day taking pictures",
          "You think you know everything about monarchs, but you really don't. Super interesting exhibits, wonderful kaleidescope of butterflies, and very knowledgeable staff.",
          "This place was really nice. LOTS of butterflies.",
          "It's as magical as it sounds!",
          "Phenomenal! It's a bit pricey for adults, imo, but not too bad with the kids. They had a total blast, loved every second of it. We did not stay that long, however. I think we were maybe in this place a total of 1.5 hrs, hence why I say it's \u2026",
          "make sure you only go with a groupon ....otherwise overpriced",
          "Had a wonderful time. Butterflies are beautiful and fast.",
          "It was more then what I expected. I loved it! Prices are very reasonable.",
          "It's a little rough to go in the summertime but springtime is amazing",
          "The exhibit was fascinating. The reptiles and fish were a nice bonus. We are happy we went!",
          "The 10 minute 3d movie before you are brought to the butterfly sanctuary about the migration of the monarch butterfly is very informative and beautiful!! I had several butterflies land on me which was awesome!! If you are afraid of bugs, I wouldn't go to the wonderland.",
          "Really cool place,will definitely go back",
          "Closes by 4 says open till 5. Lame",
          "Such a fun experience. Perfect for family outings but the price is awfully high for what it is. Still had to give the place 5 stars though because the butterfly area itself is amazing. I'm glad they added the reptile area, they had \u2026",
          "Took my lady there and she became butterfly drunk By the time we left. Well be going back.",
          "My grandaughter just loved the place so i did too.",
          "Super hot and humid but totally worth it for butterfly lovers and little kids",
          "I loved this place!  First you  watch a 3d video about the life of a monarch butterfly. It was cute and informative. You then get to see cacoons, larvae and such. Then you get released into the area with free flying beautiful butterflies! \u2026",
          "Nice 3D movie before entering the butterfly area. Lot's of different types of butterflies. Reptile, bug and fish exhibits too. Snack area has good variety of food.",
          "Really fun experience. Great place for kids or dates. So many butterflies and moths I didn't even know existed. Some of these are huge! There is a very large greenhouse-type room where you can leisurely walk through while these creatures \u2026",
          "Very Cool!  Largest Butterfly Conservatory in the United States.  Other activities besides butterflies as well including reptiles, insects, and fish.  All great for a fun family day......Unless you show up and discover that your 4 year old is suddenly very afraid of 6 legged 2 winged insects.",
          "Just fabulous. The whole place was amazing.  We also went into the aquarium on the same grounds.",
          "It was nice. Would have enjoyed being able to attract them to me w/nectar solution.",

          "Love this place!  Helpful volunteers.  Beautiful facility",
          "Fabulous exhibits, well informed docents.",
          "Great place to take the younger kids. Learn about the life cycle of a butterfly.  Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Many species fo butterflies flying around as you walk amongst them.",
          "Amazing.  My kids absolutely love this place.",
          "The kids though it was amazing place",
          "Fun for my family and my 3 year old. A bit pricey.",
          "Very expensive for what you get. It ends up feeling like a guided tour. Butterfly sanctuary was amazing but not worth the cost.",
          "Fabulous experience for any age.",
          "Oh I had SO much fun here! Went with my husband and even he enjoyed it. The extra exhibits were fantastic and even the movie was good. Butterflies freely land on you, overall the place looks like a magical rainforest. Highly recommend it!",
          "A diverse experience learning about butterflies, insects, and reptiles. Aboretrum is clean and beautiful with plants and unique art displays. If they came down on price of admission, than the money you pay to go would be worth it.",
          "Loved this beautiful haven for butterflies and nature. So thankful to our AZ family taking us here to enjoy with them and grandkids. Happy we could all interact with nature and the butterflies. Super awesome memories made here! Kudos to \u2026",
          "Not much happening and I have seen it done better in other places",
          "I almost cried! This place is magical.",
          "Very neat place, but I think $50 for a senior couple to visit is a little too expensive.",
          "Worth the money, a very enjoyable experience. My almost 5 year old had a great time too. The butterfly habitat was amazing. We also enjoyed the giant insect, reptile and aquatic displays. We will return.",
          "Very nice experience.  Butterflies might actually land on you, which happened to two of us while visiting.   Reptile exhibit included.",
          "The most beautiful place to take you children very educational for the entire family that A+",
          "Love coming here! After several visits my daughter has finally lost the fear of having butterflies land of her. I recommend a very bright colorful shirt if you want to walk around with butterflies giving you kisses!",
          "If u have school age kid then wonderful. My school aged kid love the conservatory and 3d movie. It is lovely experience to watch emerging butterfly from pupa. But on the other hand I had hard time to keep my younger one in control. Baby was \u2026",

          "Beautiful! The Monarch lifecycle video was the best I have seen and the 3 D effects are outstanding.

          "Great place for kids especially when it's 100+ outside",
          "We had an awesome time here, EVERY single employee we encountered was friendly, happy to be of help, and smiling. Loved the 3D film, a first for me. That was really neat, looked like you could catch the butterflies. Ran into an employee named Sharon, sweet lady.",
          "Hands down just loved it!!",
          "Awesome place! So glad to find out this existed! I got tickets for this in combination with the aquarium next door, and it's definitely worth it. The butterflies are neat, and they showcased ones in every stage of their lives. The even had \u2026",
          "The facility is beautiful. I went on a hot day thinking everything was indoors but the butterflies are mostly outside. I'd recommend to go early in the morning. Was a bit pricey for an adult ticket but worth doing it at least once. Great short field trip. Seems like the butterflies pose for pictures. Be careful not to step on them.",
          "Super boring. We were literally searching for butterflies.  Like 20 in the entire outdoor room. Walk in a big circle. In 3 mins. Hardly any butterflies.  I thought there would be sooo many flying around.  Nope not worth the money. Kids were disappointed.",

          "It's a neat little place to see butterflies. If you have been to a butterfly house, this one is no different. The negative - It is overpriced in my opinion, and the cafe food is not very good (muffins and cookies were stale.) The positive - \u2026",
          "Awesome displays! You also get to go in with all the live butterflies, and they randomly will land on you. Several different types of butterflies to see around the entire complex. You can spend hours looking at all of the different types. Very enjoyable!!!\n\nThey also have various types of insects as well.",

          "Loved it tropical paradise in the desert.",
          "A little costly, but cool",
          "Definitely worth a visit as different things for the kids to do. We wanted to go to the butterfly museum but dogs are not allowed.  We walk around the center. It's really neat.",
          "It's very expensive. Has wonderful exhibits. It was fun but costly",
          "Mediocre quality displays. Very high cost.",

          "This whole area is great. Super summer fun!",

          "This place is just a magical oasis.",

          "Loved it! Even though I underestimated the learning experience, the kids had a great time.",
          "Great place to bring the children, especially small children.  However, I'm much older ... and I really enjoyed as well.  Very serene and loved the live classical music.  Really set an awesome tone.  A very special day with our  grandkids.",
          "Great place to visit at least once.   More if you like it",

          "Very interesting, unlike anything else!",
          "Such a neat place to visit! I liked that you can go in and see the butterflies as many times as you like during your visit. We had 2 little ones under 3 years old and the butterflies were a little overwhelming for them, but they loved looking at the bugs and fish and other exhibits. Definitely hoping to come back soon!",
          "A Beautiful place. To see new butterfly's hatch from their Chrysalis and take flight I didn't want to post spoiler pictures. But if you wear bright colors you make get some butterfly kisses",
          "This was even better than we expected. The butterfly house was huge. Then there was even more to see. We thought we would be done in an hour, but we were there for almost 3 hours. We probably would have stayed even longer but they were closing.",
          "Place is amazing..little expensive ..family restroom in deep need of a good cleaning",
          "Great place for the kids there are hundreds of butterflies all different colors and if you are still they will land on you. You learn the life cycle of the butterfly",
          "Beautiful place to take family and friends",
          "My 3 year old and 19 month old had a blast here. They were in awe of the butterflies. There are sharks and stingrays, fish and reptiles to see.",
          "We have an Odysea membership and finally decided to try this place.  Overall the prices did seem a bit high, but there was plenty for us to look at in our ~2.5 hour visit.  My 3 year old daughter loved the large open butterfly room as well as the hatching exhibit immediately before.",
          "The butterflies are beautiful.  My only concern was that there were a lot of very young children running around and it made me nervous because they could step on the butterflies.",
          "One of my daughter favorite places and I don't blame her so neat",
          "Loved it grandkids love it also.",

          "Take lots of pictures and ask questions people are very knowledgeable",
          "Great learning experience.",
          "Fun place for the kids.  It was a little bit light on content.  There was not an overwhelming amount of butterflies as I would have thought.  Also, the additional exhibits felt very tacked on.  That being said, the kids had a good time and the video part was very well received.  Overall, a good time, if only for an hour or two at most.",
          "We so enjoyed seeing another states Butterfly education resource.",
          "Coolest experience ever... I felt like a child on vacation but that\u2019s totally okay with me.. I would go back every time I\u2019m in town. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely overpriced but worth it to experience it at least once! \n\nThe 3D film is a little weird \u2026",
          "It was amazing so many beautiful butterflies and even a couple chickens",
          "Ok... It's a 5 for what you get.  You do see A LOT of butterflies! When I saw A LOT I mean A LOT! And the employees are generally nice to interact with and know their stuff! The reason I have it a 3 is price..... WAY over priced.  You are \u2026",
          "My whole family loved this place. It is very relaxing. Do try the edible bugs from the vending machine, won\u2019t you?",
          "This place is amazing. I have never seen so many butterfly in one place. As soon as you walk into their habitat, you are going to see butterflies flying around. Some of them might land on you but don't worry and do not try to shoo them away, they may be just needing a rest.",
          "Fantastic, loads of beautiful butterflies and other things to see. Very friendly and helpful staff",

          "So much fun, very educational",
          "Very informative, incredible 3D movie! Lots and lots of butterflies, some beautiful moths and an incredible butterfly atrium. \n\nThey also have lizards, green eyed tree frogs, tarantulas, snakes, bugs, millipedes and more. Inside there's a small cafe and a gift shop. \n\nNice place to visit especially when it's super hot outside.",
          "Indoor, humid and warm in side the butterfly dorm like tropical forest. You can see butterfly with blue, white, and other amazing color, not allowed to touch but the can land on you. I wore white silk coat one type butterfly land on my arm \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Pioneer Living History Museum is located at 3901 W. Pioneer Road in Phoenix, Arizona. The museum, also known as Pioneer Village, has 30 historic original and reconstructed buildings from the 1880s and early 1900s on its 90-acre property.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1956, a group of Arizona history enthusiasts became concerned about the razing and demolition of historical buildings in the state Arizona as a result of new construction by land developers. This group formed the \"Pioneer Arizona Foundation, Inc. Among the notable founders of the foundation were former Governor Paul Fannin, Senator Barry Goldwater, Senator Carl Hayden, and Wesley Bolin.The main goal of the foundation was to save some of the historical buildings that were built between the years 1870 and 1910. The members of the foundation believed that by saving these buildings and by creating an atmosphere of the era, future generations would benefit by learning about what the early pioneers of the west went through. The foundation purchased 90 acres of land in north Phoenix and the museum was inaugurated in February 15, 1969. Among the exhibits found in the museum is the Exhibit Hall Firearms, Tools, Locks & Keys.In July 2010, the property where the museum is situated was put up in auction. Great Western Historical LLC outbid Phoenix in the state-land auction. According to one of the new owners, Eric Roles: \"The state will not permit private lands, which the museum lands will become once the purchase transaction is closed, to serve water and wastewater from state leased lands.\" Therefore, the owners ordered the closure of the museum. Eventually, a water line to the museum site was built and the museum was able to continue its operations.\n\n\n== Buildings and structures ==\nThere are 10 original historical buildings and structures including the structures of a ranch complex and a farm. The museum also has 15 reconstructed buildings and/or structures.\n\n\n=== Historic original ===\nThe original structures are the following:\n\nThe Sears House a.k.a. the Victorian House which was built in the early 1890s on an acre homestead in Phoenix by John Marion Sears. It was originally located in 4032 N. 7th Street.\nThe  Ashurst Cabin which was built in 1878 near Prescott. This was the boyhood home of Senator Henry Fountain Ashurst, the first Arizona senator following statehood. Ashurst served in the senate from 1912 to 1942. The family cooked their food in the fireplace, however during the summer they did their cooking outside over a campfire. The family lived in the cabin until 1893.\nThe Phoenix Bakery building which was built in 1881 and was originally located at 7 West Washington Street in Phoenix. Edward Elsele and Alfred Becker owned the bakery. In 1910, the bakery became the first one in the territory to try out a horseless carriage to deliver their products. In 1929, their sons decided to go wholesale and renamed their product Holsum.\nThe Flying \u201cV\u201d Cabin which was built in 1880 and was located in Canyon Creek, Young, Arizona. The cabin has notched gun ports which were used in July 17, 1882, during the Battle of Big Dry Wash, the last Apache War in that area. John D. Tewksbury Sr., of Pleasant Valley War fame lived here with his two wives and children.\nThe Gordon School which was built in 1885 in Gordon Canyon which is located east of Payson, Arizona. The school was used to teach the citizens of the area until 1930.\nThe Meritt Farm House which was built in 1910 on 100 acres which John and Emma Meritt purchased in Phoenix.\nThe Northern Home which was built in 1885 in Newman Canyon close to Flagstaff, Arizona. The house once belonged to Jeff Newman who lived there with his family.\nThe Opera House which was built in the early 1870s in Prescott by James Howey. In 1876, the Goldwater family established their first store there. Howey sold the building to Levi Bashford who in 1882, added a stage and converted the place into an opera house. John Drew, Jr. and Lillie Langtry performed in the opera house. The building ceased as an opera house in 1899.\nThe Teacherage Cabin which was built in 1890 in Pleasant Valley, Payson, Arizona. This was a small cabin which served as a home and incentive for the local teacher.\nThe Ranch Complex which was built in 1870 and was located at Gordon Canyon in Payson, Arizona.\n\n\n=== Historic reconstructed ===\nThe buildings and structures which were authentically reconstructed are the following:\n\nThe Bandstand is a reconstructed bandstand built in 1881 in Globe, Arizona.\nThe Bank is a reconstructed Valley Bank built in 1884 which was located in Phoenix.\nThe Blacksmith Shop is the reconstructed Middleton & Pascoe's blacksmith shop which was built c. 1870 in the town of Globe.\nThe Carpenter Shop is a reconstructed shop which serviced Prescott in 1880.\nThe Community Church is the reconstruction of the St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal Church which was built in 1880 in the town of Globe.\nThe Dress Shop is what a ready made clothing shop looked like in Phoenix in 1890.\nThe Mercantile is  a reconstructed 1890s store which now serves as the museums gift shop.\nThe Miner's Cabin is a replica of the type of cabin in the mountains of Clifton which a miner and his family would live in.\nThe Print Shop is a reconstructed 1890s Phoenix printing shop.\nThe Sheriff's Office is a reconstructed adobe building which was built in 1881 in the town of Globe.\nThe Southern House is a reconstructed typical \"Anglo\" house built in 1858 in Tucson which is located in southern Arizona.\nThe Stage Stop is an exact reconstructed duplicate of the Darrell Duppa Stage Station which served the old Phoenix to Wickenburg road from 1871 to 1873. It was operated by Phillip Darrell Duppa, the pioneer credited with giving Phoenix its name.\nThe Smith and Dodd's Tonsorial Parler is the reconstruction of a territorial barber shop.\nThe Town Ditch is a replica of the type of ditch which was used in the towns founded by the early pioneers. The water carried by the ditches was used for drinking, cooking, washing, etc.Fort Woods is a replica what a fort looked liked in the west in the 1860s. The first structures built were replicas of those found in Fort McDowell. After other structures were added to the fort, it was decided that the fort be named after Sergeant Brent Woods, a Buffalo Soldier of company B, 9th Cavalry who was awarded the Medal of Honor.The Town Cemetery is a replica of a common pioneer cemetery. The graves at the time were covered with rocks with the intention of keeping wild animals away. This particular cemetery serves as a memorial to honor some of the volunteers who helped build the museum and who are now deceased. Their names and date of death are craved on the headstones.\n\n\n== Gallery of the original historic buildings ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of historic properties in Phoenix, Arizona\nCave Creek Museum\nChildren's Museum in Phoenix\nPioneer and Military Memorial Park\nMartin Auto Museum\nPhoenix Police Museum\nWells Fargo Museum\nList of museums in Arizona\nList of open-air and living history museums in the United States\nList of historic properties in Goldfield, Arizona\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPioneer Living History Museum",

          "As one reviewer said a work in progress. But we found it interesting and worth the visit. Easy sidewalk type path around to the various old buildings with side trails if you wanted to venture off the concrete. Hope they continue to bring in more buildings to bring pioneer life",
          "We didn't get in the gate. When we arrived there were a few cars in the parking lot and some people milling around the entrance and then we saw the sign - closed. What? Why? We talked to the woman who \"made the call\" to close for the day because it rained the night before",

          "We knew that the artifacts would be old, but everything was very run down and poorly kept. In addition, several venues were closed due to weddings. There were no staff members in period costumes as advertised. It took us 30 minutes to see everything and not worth the admission",

          "Went on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Wasn't packed at all and exceptionally priced. We spent about 2 hours here and saw almost everything. Lots of interesting old buildings and artifacts. The kids loved the corn maze and the animals. The only \u2026",

          "It was amazing. Like going back in time. We were there to watch that Arizona State Quick Draw Championship.  It was something to see. Everyone needs to see this place. It takes you back to the real western days.",
          "I attended for a field trip. It was a nice enough place. But there was no programming for the kids or anything to really learn about, other than some plaques on the buildings. They enjoyed the gold panning although most kids got soaking wet \u2026",
          "So much history. It was a memorable experience with the grandkids. Makes for a great family day outing.",
          "Very educational. Nice way to spend a few hours. Dogs allowed on leash.",

          "Lots of well supplied displays. Knowledgeable staff. Only $8.00 foe seniors.",
          "One of the best small town walk throughs I've been to. Way bigger than I ever thought. September was quiet (duh 103 degrees) but personally I like that. Can't wait to come back when the desert is flourishing. The volunteers and workers here \u2026",
          "It's amazing, it's huge and so many cool things to see.",
          "This is a local gem of Phoenix  that I visited on an elementary school field trip when I was a child.  I recently took my family to visit it for their first time.  We all enjoyed it.  I do recommend going early in the day during the summer.  It gets extremely hot in the afternoon.",
          "Worth a visit for anyone intetested in Arizona history, also very good for families. Twenty five acres with several dozen buildings (victorian home, ranch, schoolhouse, jail, etc) mostly from the late 1800's. Most were authentic or built \u2026",

          "Very nice place to use the little bit more stop around and give it a little bit more class",
          "It is a beautiful place, a lot to walk so I recommend to wear comfortable shoes, hat and sunscreen... I love their burguers so good and inexpensive.",
          "My daughter and I enjoyed taking a self-guided tour through the paved paths to the historic buildings. A bonus of the visit was the telephone museum and the lovely couple who gave us a tour of the history of communication! I'd like to go \u2026",
          "It was good.  Lots of walking.  Go to the telegraph and telephone museum first.  It's included in the ticket.",
          "Telephone museum was worthwhile. Enjoyed the rest of the pioneer village. Volunteers were very friendly and helpful.",

          "One of the most amazing places at our small town.\nReally beatiful collection!",
          "This is a great look at how people lived in the old west. I should have called ahead since all if the attractions were closed. It was still fun and it really makes you think when you see a cabin that they cut holes in the wall to shoot out of. Fun place will go back.",
          "Great place in the middle of the desert north of Phoenix.",
          "Nice place to see a bit of South West history. We came during week so not as many people in period dress but we still enjoyed it. Someone else  mentioned about not being able to go in to houses but they are decked out so I can understand \u2026",
          "The kids had a blast, several hours of fun and fresh air.",
          "Great experience many old building with lots of facts of pioneer living in west. Wish we could had gone into these buildings , we weren\u2019t aware how big it was or the fact that bringing water is a must. Only bathrooms on site is near the entrance.",
          "Had my nieces wedding there this evening turned out beautiful.",
          "The experience was ok. The houses were amazing!! Sadly, the goats have over grown feet to the point they trip. Their cage is full of poop and they seem very hungry. They also got stuck in a net while were there. The chickens on the other \u2026",
          "Love this place!  History and a good time for all ages!",
          "We had a great time there was a quick draw competition",
          "Really interesting except the fact that we cannot go inside the houses...I also really enjoyed the phone museum presentation.",
          "Great place for school field trip. The speech about firearm safety before the gun show didn't seem to fit. A speech about wild west history would've been more fitting. The group I chaperoned wanted so badly, as did I,  to tour the insides \u2026",
          "I do not recommend this place in the summer. There is nothing going on. When its not so hot, they have people  dressed the parts walking around, in the sumer its a ghost town.",
          "Nice place to visit.  Very friendly staff.",
          "Enjoyed visiting the buildings of 19th century Arizona.",
          "Pretty cool place to take the kids. Lots to walk and see. The little gift shop has real cheap gifts and snacks for sale,which is recommended due to all the walking. Beautiful scenery with the mountains around as well. Also a grill area where you can by food and drinks.",
          "I loved walking the trails that take you by the relocated buildings of Arizona's history.  Each building has as a good description of its history and orgin.  My children loved the old farm equipment and the 4 foot tall walls of the hay bale \u2026",
          "Fun way to spend the day being outside, while at the same time not required to exert yourself much. I would\u2019ve like to had more access to inside the buildings. Overall fun day!",
          "The beautiful place reminds me of when I was a kid being at my Grandma's ranch",
          "This is a great place for a child's birthday party. They had food, bouncy houses, a gun show, gold panning, and everyone could visit the attractions while there. They took care of everything and it was really simple to show up and enjoy the party.",
          "Is a good place to visit with the kid's",

          "It was awesome seeing a part of Arizona's history",

          "A great place to visit. More to see during the summer hours or on weekdays it seems, rather than Sundays. Still a nice, easy walk, great photos, and interesting exhibits.",
          "Wonder what life in 19th-century Arizona was like? The Pioneer Living History Museum has relocated historic farmstead homes and painstakingly recreated shops, blacksmith, church, gallows & more.\n\nAlso of interest: The Telephone Museum onsite with hundreds of vintage phones!",

          "What a great place to visit. Came here on a school field trip. My daughter and her friends enjoyed all the cool stuff they had. Specially the telephone museum that's a must!!! Take your kids in to experience what some of us grew up with. \u2026",
          "Cool little town. The kids got a kick out of the gun show.",
          "Pretty fun museum for the family if you're into this type of stuff.  Right off the highway and easy to get to.",
          "Amazing place to go back in time. Great learning experience. Staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.",
          "It's just okay, this isnt really a place I'd bring my kids because there isnt much educational elements and the place isn't well cared for. I think if they cleaned and tried to preserve everything it would be more interesting or even put up \u2026",
          "Great place to learn and see history",
          "Kids loved panning for gold the best and seeing the old structures gave us a glimpse of how people used to live.",
          "My buddy loves coming to events here... If you haven't been here, you're missing out!",
          "Very fun place. I\u2019ve been here once before a couple years ago. We loved the area and the museum. We got to see a shooting competition this visit, and we had my mom with us who loves these types of museums. Definitely take the time to go into the telegraph museum just left of the ticket window.",
          "I learned so much visiting this museum.  It is really spread out and you do have to do a bit of walking. They have preserved such a variety of buildings and artifacts from the late 1800s.",
          "Today when we visited the Museum unfortunately it was off season. But it was all worth while just to visit the Pioneer Telephone Museum there. It is fantastic. My husband is retired SW Bell Telephone in Texas. The guide for this place is \u2026",

          "Very educational",
          "Very interesting. Had a great time! Don\u2019t miss the fascinating Telephone Museum while you\u2019re there.\n\nWorth the trip!",
          "Perhaps this place was once living but now it feels like a ghost town. I would recommend them marketing it as such. Very run down. The phone museum was nice however.",
          "Great place to plug into history. Lots of cool exhibits. The boys learned alot",
          "Very cool, but not in the summer.",

          "Very cool to see all the historical houses and structure.. I highly recommend taking your children ..",
          "Large grounds. Not really \"living\" Phone museum was great, phone museum docent was great. Maybe some shade spots or other displays to look at would be helpful. Gallows was cool, Rope needs replacing. Some explanation would be good.",
          "The walk around the really old part, with the Flying V house was fun, and the kids loved panning for gold and watching the gun fight. The kids and I were disappointed that we couldn't go into the houses though. Looking through the doorways and windows doesn't give you much of a view.",
          "This is an amazing place to go to immerse yourself in \"living\" history with period correct reenactors that take representing history seriously. Cowboys, Civil War, Revolutionary War, etc.",
          "This was a nice place to go for an afternoon walk. It seems to be very run down. Walked along behind other guests and multiple times heard her mention how much it had changed since she had visited 15 years ago. Paint was peeling and \u2026",
          "Great phone history (\"Talk to bell Atlantic\") regards to Joe!",

          "Nighttime paranormal investigation with PAPS.  Lots of fun. Fantastic place rich with history.",
          "Great place to bring kids. Lots of walking. I wouldn't recommend for anyone who is unsteady on their feet not everywhere is paved. Lots of great original or exact replica pieces from history. Lets the kids run off energy.",
          "It was pretty cool, many things to see",
          "Fun experience.",
          "I have been going since I was tiny, and I loved it then. I got to take my son on his field trip there and we had a great time. The gun show was so good. I absolutely love this place.",

          "Loved the Telephone Museum.  Guide was friendly and made it fun.  Has lots of improvements,  and a Wedding was taking place on the pretty grounds.",
          "Went here on a Saturday morning as they were opening to distract a restlesstoddler.  There weren't many staff members and we were the only ones walking around.  It was a quiet morning and chilly. The toddler loved checking out the inside of \u2026",

          "Must see for Arizona residents and visitors!",

          "Amazing place! Like going back in time! Must visit at least once if not twice..",
          "So much fun!!",
          "The staff is great. Beautiful Wedding venue. Historically accurate out buildings.",
          "Went on a random Friday, no school groups.  They hadn't said on the website whether they would have any interpreters , gold panning, or a gun fight.  I assumed they'd have at least one of them.  It would have been much more engaging if \u2026",
          "Fun for kids. Go to the telephone  museum",
          "Interesting place, some of things are sort of run down though.",

          "A little out of the way, but a really neat attraction.",

          "Good price for a day's worth of family learning and fun!",
          "Cashier would prefer to be doing something else, but once you start exploring it is worth the trip.",
          "Pretty quiet and probably used more for field trips than anything. It was an interesting little place.",
          "Fun place for anyone. The museum grounds host Civil War reenactments a few times a year which are great to watch. They bring out real muskets and cannons. They even have a wedding venue with a church.",
          "Kids and I had so much fun!",
          "Came here for my son's school field trip and it was very interesting.",
          "Super fun little place! We went to watch a civil war reenactment. Good times!",
          "Not a lot of LIVING history here. Maybe we came on the wrong day/time of year? The nearby shooting range provided our soundtrack.",
          "Oh my, if you're planning a wedding.... look no further!!!!  This place is AMAZING!!!",
          "Was fun staff was friendly and helpful",
          "Not worth the price of admission",
          "Great place NOTE: New summer hours 7:00 am - 11:00 am. Because of the heat. Overall a great place and I love the buildings. I'm visiting from Wisconsin and it's an awesome place to go. I'd recommend it to everyone.",
          "Thank God they rescued these buildings years ago.. If they tried this nowadays these buildings would have been lost forever... THANK YOU and please continue the good work . Hope you can find more to preserve for the future, believe me there is not many left....",
          "This place is amazing. A great place to bring kids to learn and actually see how people lived.",

          "Very cool place to visit lots of history there",
          "There for a school field trip. Lots of old buildings and guides to explain everything. \nThere was also a cowboy shootout. They started with a safety briefing but tried to make the show funny. The kids loved it but it was loud. \nThey did have some food and drinks, the caramelized popcorn was especially good. Not too expensive either. ",
          "This is a great place to take your kid's to show them how thing's used to be,  before cell phones and even the restroom before indoor plumbing was invented.  My 8 year old had a blast and learned slot.",
          "Had a great time with the kids on the school field trip.",
          "This is a great piece of history",
          "Perfect day adventure for the whole family!",
          "THEY SHOULD TAKE BETTER CARE OF THE ANIMALS ON-SITE.!!!!! Chickens had no hay or food and muddy water. The goats need grooming and fresh water.  No one their cares at all.  It's very very said!!!!",
          "Fun, interesting",
          "The name implies living history, it is a collection of buildings and equipment but no characters or costumes. Disappointed in the lack of living elements.",
          "What a learning experience.   The volunteers were very knowledgeable and they played their parts very well.   The telephone museum was very informative.",
          "Great place! The gunfight was fun",
          "Cute, not bad if you're looking to fill some time",
          "Great fun and interactive",
          "Very interesting. Takes about 2 hours to walk around and see all the displays. Recommend this as a way to see history.",
          "This is a town that is privately owned.  The buildings are original but this wasn't where all of the buildings originated.   The guy that owns the land bought the buildings and recreated how a western town in Arizona looked like in the \u2026",
          "Awesome place the maze was so fun.",
          "I thought this was really nice, so many historical homes to see all on one property. It's definitely rustic to visit but It's a day's worth of signt seeing if you're interested in the pioneer times.",
          "Historically correct and very clean. Great for kids to learn.",
          "Was a good experience, as many have said I\u2019m glad they managed to rescue this bit of history from destruction. \n\nSadly most of the buildings are close to falling apart and they don\u2019t let you tour them due to the fear of \u201ctheft\u201d according to \u2026",
          "Self-guided tours. Best time to visit when they have the Civil War or Revolutionary War weekend events.",
          "Loved the amount of things to see..lots of history to explore. Wish the gold panning was real..or there was a mine you can really go down in. Will definitely be back though..want to check out the paranormal activity they say is in some buildings..hope to see something!",
          "Some kind of Hawk on top of the light pole",
          "The website highlights all kinds of events that supposedly go on there, with costumed actors and all that.  When we went the only employee in the entire place that we saw was the one selling admission.  Inside, we could look at the old \u2026",
          "Enjoyed every step.",
          "Really cool to see so much of our past put together in one place.  Unfortunately, many of the buildings and other artifacts are neglected and falling apart. I'm sure this must be due to lack of funds.  More visitors and gifts are needed to fill the need.  This place is important.",
          "Not bad. Snakes around, but pretty accurate. \n\nAccurate enough to have a gallows, which was strangely an Eagle Scout Project. Kinda strange and might need removal due what I hope are obvious reasons.",
          "Fairly run down.",
          "Lots of original pioneer buildings",
          "Great little place hidden off the I 17.  There is history, food and drink, picnic areas, festivals, hay and trolley rides and bouncy houses.  Be,sure to check out the fall festival and pumpkin garden.",

          "Went few months ago with my hubby and 3 kids 5, 7, & 9. We all had a great time walking around and looking at all the old buildings and different things there. We spent about 2ish hours.  Definitely a place for mornings or cooler time of year, but is a great place to stop by. My kids still talk about wanting to go back again.",

          "Got here at 1:30. No one in period dress, no one to tap for information. Cafe and snack bar closed. Very disappointing. Could have been really interesting if done properly. Asked about snack bar and costumed players was told it wasnt open this late. Late? 1:30...... And no discount.",

          "They were short staffed and no guides the day I visited. This place could be great if had better staffing and up keep.",
          "Lots of land. Great for a two or three hour walk and tour. Most buildings are replicas, not originals. Most are in a state of disrepair. The goats were in not-ideal housing conditions. Most information of each building posted was meant for the demographic of elementary aged children. ",
          "Great place to visit history.",
          "Great place to check out..",
          "I thought this place was very nice. I believe its intention was to show you sort of how life was 100 years ago in Arizona, but while you could almost get into the feel of it, the mood is broken by the lack of upkeep.\n\nWhile it was very educational, and there were lots of neat things to see, I felt a lack of passion.

          "It's fun to visit Arizona's history.   It would be better if the people working there seemed more knowledgeable and excited to share it.",

          "More than you think . The live telephone tour was great.",
          "This was a very nice educational place. It was interesting to see the how the pioneer village was set up. The volunteers we met were most helpful and informative. The marketing director even stopped and asked how we liked the grounds. \n\nThe restaurant was reasonably priced and the food was good. ",
          "I felt the experience was quite disappointing. According to what was presented on the advertisements, I was expecting more fun for the family. There was an admission fee but also an additional cost for any activity you wanted to do. I'd \u2026",

          "Been numerous times and so different to Add Elephant Park, what is great is that you see animals that you will not see in Addo, Giraffe, Cheetah and more chance of seeing a Rhino here than you ever will in Addo. Compact in size and good for a couple of hours. Great for kids as",
          "This is a lovely, quiet and relaxed park. Came 2 days after visiting Addo, and they are so different. Wonderful to see so many giraffe, buffalo, sprinkbok and the ultimate for us - the baby Rhino. Cafe was excellent. It seems an odd setting, surrounded by houses, power lines",
          "This is an excellent park on the door step of Port Elizabeth. The drive through takes about two hours. You will not be disappointed.",
          "Saw some great animals here including elephants, giraffe, zebra, warthogs etc but the real highlight was seeing 5 rhino really close to. We stayed there watching them for about 30 minutes. There was a Mum, Dad and small baby plus a romantic couple who were being really loving",
          "We loved our visit to Kragga Kamma. Definitely recommend the guided drive as you go off road to get as close as possible to the animals, and Terry our guide was very knowledgable and interesting telling us the story of the animals. Loads of baby animals too which was amazing!",
          "Travelled from UK to stay in PE with my daughter and hubby for a few weeks over Christmas and New year. What a delight it was to visit this game park, only 10 mins away. We didn't take the guided tour, but did a self drive. Visited Krugersdorp National park many times and Addo",
          "Worth a visit. We've never been disappointed with the game viewing we've experienced on every trip to the park. You can either select to self drive, or go on a guided tour for a very reasonable cost.",
          "Impressive trip on the day. The trip guide was well knowledgeable with the animals. Trip was well organized",
          "Driving around the game park we came face to face with 2 rhino's....awesome ! Definitely going back to see more of the same",
          "Fantastic game drive, was really nice, tour guide information was fantastic,beautiful animals, looked after very well, thanks alot for the experience. Will see you again",
          "Visited during time in PE for the cricket. If you want to see at relaxed pace so many of Africa\u2019s loved and endangered beasts then look no further. 10 minutes out of town if you have your own car then it\u2019s an absolute steal at RND100 for as long as you want. Easy navigation",
          "We visited the game park today and decided to take the self drive option which was R100 per person. Just as well,as had we gone on an official tour this would have been R265 per person. The route was clearly delineated but was pretty rough in places and more suitable for a 4x4",
          "Having visited Kragga Kamma a few times over a number of years, I can only recommend that you stay the night in one of their lodges. The proximity to the wildlife is wonderful and the early mornings are truly special in this place. The diversity of species is also quite",
          "Love coming here for a few hours in the afternoon. Lovely to see giraffes as they are not in Addo Elephant National Park. Animals well cared for and breeding well, lots of babies around. The rescued lions now look chilled and much happier than when tey first arrived. Also in",
          "Had the most amazing morning in the park. The wild life is plentiful, in great condition and most have a newborn close behind them. The story behind the three lions is heart warming. I\u2019d recommend this spot to locals and tourists alike. Added bonus it\u2019s 15 mins from Walmer.",
          "We arranged a private shore excursion with Peter Giddy Tours and this was our second venue. Looking around from the inside of a car we easily spotted warthogs, water buffalo, giraffe, zebra, rhino, ostrich but our highlight was a trip into the cheetah area.......we watched in",
          "It is a great experience to view animals at such close range. An informative tour guide. The stories about thd animals they have are amazing.",
          "It was exceptional. The game park has beautiful animals and you get a personal experience of them. Terry the guide was extremely knowledgeable when it came to the animals. It was a lovely experience.",
          "Not far from Port Elizabeth, and the best value i have had for age's.(R100)(\u00a35.25)($6.5) pp saw everthing in the park except the Pocupine's.We used our own transport so were able to take our time. Exception value when you take into out entrance toVictoria Falls cost",
          "Easy vibes for family treat.and you can do a self drive as well. Roads easy to follow if you lucky enough some animals may come veryy close to your car. Please read the lion story",
          "We enjoyed a fantastic outing with our group this morning. Terri was a great guide and gave us a very informative guided tour. So close to the N2 and really worth a visit. Great cappuccino to finish off the day",
          "We did the two hour guided tour and it was fsntadtic. We did see all the animals, except the lions. The guide was very nice and could explain lots of things about the animals. I highly recommend it!",
          "We went by private car, and saw plenty wild life, lots of giraffe to see including babies. Buck, birds, lions, cheetah and you are able to interact with a tame cheetah. Great for photo ops. This place is a must, small, but pleasant.",
          "Kragga Kamma Game Park is a small safari drive just outside Port Elizabeth. It was very easy to find and we chose to self drive through the park. The roads were easy to navigate and in good condition. On entry we were greeted by gate security who took our payment and explained",
          "We saw so many different animals with youngsters because with the guide we went off the normal roads. Our guide was a younger woman who knew very much about all animals and also told us many nice stories about them. We also witnessed feeding time with the cheetahs, which was",
          "This reserve is just outside of Port Elizabeth on the edge of one of it's more affluent neighborhoods. Getting there is easy, and the self-drive option is simple (and inexpensive), with no lines of any kind when we arrived about mid-afternoon. You simply follow the dirt trail",
          "We went in a group of 5. Some had been multiple times before but this was the first time we went on a guided tour here. Wow! It was exceptional! We learnt so much and what fun! Our tour guide Terry had quite a sense of humor and what a love for the animals. It was just the",
          "We saw so many different animals up close in their natural environment. We came from Canada and wanted to have one safari experience and this was it. What made it very special was the humour, knowledge, and passion of the tour guide. This was an excellent value for a truly",
          "It was an amazing experience the ranger was informative and we mostly enjoyed seeing the rhinos and the cheaters. I even recommend the park to my family aswell.",
          "This must be on the bucket list as it is a small reserve with great viewing opportunities. It is a self drive reserve therefore you get close to the animals. The cheetah enclosure was a fantastic highlight with the three brothers.",
          "Not the typical game drive, We went here on a end of term function. We saw almost all the animals on the sheet. Ended up having lunch at the restaurant next to the cheetahs.",
          "This Drive was absolutely amazing ! Our Guide was well-informed and well-spoken.... he made the trip a memorable one ! Thank you.",
          "First drive into this Game farm was on the 2 hour guided tour and been back several times after it. Couple trip then solo then family trips xxxxx. No where can one view the animals and there is plenty to view (giraffes/spring-boks/elephant/lions and lots more) so up close and",
          "Love driving around looking at all the animals. To see Giraffe, Rhino, Lion and so many other wild animals in their nature habitat. Need a bit of a high raised car especially after rain for some areas, but otherwise roads are really decent.",
          "Went with family n friends on the 2 Hour Guided drive around the game park. Our guide and driver, Terry (I think) was super informative and funny at times. Amazing spectacle of animals different species of bucks, Rhinos, Zebras, Girrafes including predatory big cats like Lions",
          "Beyond expectations. The wildlife is so up close and varied. If you are visiting Port Elizabeth it definitely should be on the itinerary.",
          "Recent I spent two nights at this amazing venue,with two friends,to celebrate a special birthday and a reunion of our hitch-hiking experience in Europe in the 70's. One friend travelled from Jbg; the other from East London.We checked into the fully-equipped Giraffe Cottage,",
          "We found this reserve almost by mistake, just wanting to find something to do on our last day in PE! But what a find! It is a relatively small reserve where a lot of the animals have been rescued, but you can self-drive and you can see rhino, buffalo, zebra, giraffe, ostrich,",
          "Unlike other parks, There\u2019s no barrier between you and the animals when you stay overnight here\u2026 We stayed for two nights and woke up to giraffes, rhinos and other animals right outside our cabin which was amazing\u2026. Before sunset and we walked over to see the cheetahs getting",
          "There are not so many reserves with such a diversity of animals including giraffes (rarely found in West Cape). The game drive was the chipest if we compare with similar parks (Addo, Plettenberg Game, Shamwari). At 12 am an interesting moment: feeding of cheetah. The place",
          "If you are in PE and don't want to travel to Addo for some game watching, just visit Kragga Kamma. Great people with a passion for the work they are doing. A great variety of animals available. You are always guaranteed to see something at Kragga Kamma!",
          "Nice game drive on a chilly spring day. It was especially perfect for the kids as it was not too long and our game driver - Michael, had a great personality and was quite knowledgeable. Our 10yr old loved it",
          "Great for young children to experience wildlife up close. The giraffe and cheetah viewing was exciting for both adults and children. Great value for the money.",
          "Had such an incredible day, with friends and kids! Saw the rhinos and lots of cheetahs. Bought food and sat by the braai pick nick area, where the kids played! Was a great day! Was a bit expensive to get in but we stayed for hours and had a lovely time!!",
          "This is well worth the visit. Not expensive and friendly helpful staff. There were a selection of animals including cheaters lions and giraffes. A friendly restaurant and places to braid. If your Tim I g is right you can see the animals being fed. Also some good wooden walkways.",
          "A lovely way to spend a couple of hours, a small Game Farm 20 mins from the Beachfront, Chalets available for overnight stays.",
          "I took friends with children there, and we did the drive and then went for some toasties and then it was feeding time for the cheetahs. Quite an amazing experience seeing them so close up. Thotoughly enjoyed!",
          "Our family regularly visits this amazing Game Park, its a favourite with our boys and loved by us all! We live in PE so all our visits are day trips. When we have visitors from out of town or overseas, we always highly recommend a visit to Kragga Kamma Game Park. The",
          "I have visited here a few times on day drives and have stayed overnight in the chalets. The chalets are basic, quite rustic but roomy. You can get so close to the wildlife it is phenomenal. It\u2019s quiet and peaceful and yet a stones throw from PE. I took family from Switzerland",
          "A definite stop when in Port Elizabeth... great animal sightings, conservation efforts and lovely accommodation",
          "On Thursday 6 June I accompanied a class of 7 and 8 year old boys,on a school outing to the Kragga Kamma Game Park. It was a cold, grey day, but that did not detract from the wonderful experience. On arrival the boys were seated on an open, but canopied truck, perfect for",
          "We have renewed our family membership for the second year now. It is well worth it to be able to go as often as we want for a drive around the game park. Right inside PE without having to leave city boundaries. Once kids exams have finished, we want to go see the new additions,",
          "We were staying inside the park, but along with self-driving took part in a 2-hour guided game drive led by Michael. He was friendly and knowledgeable and knew just where to find the animals. We particularly enjoyed seeing the rhinos and the baby giraffe (only 2 weeks old!). He",
          "My first time at the park. Yesterday, daddy and myself visited the park. Wow, fantastic. We've seen so many animals. We enjoyed tasty food at the restaurant for lunch. Food very good and the staff are fantastic. It's beautiful nature, birds, animals and it's just a have to go",
          "A must for families to visit. Clean safe and affordable. What an amazing place. I would recommend this to any one in the world",
          "Not only did Kragga Kamma Game Park not disappoint but the tour guide \"Lonwabo\" was the best tour guide I\u2019ve ever had! He is full of knowledge and made it so much fun, interesting and overall had a great time.",
          "Rainy day no good for beach but pleasant driving around seeing animals up close. More indigenous plants would be an asset and add to an African bush feeling.",
          "Was looking for somewhere different to stay during a recent trip to PE and was not disappointed. Some of the other reviewers remarked that the park was like a self drive zoo, and I must admit driving around, did give me that feeling too, but when you stay over, the experience is",
          "Affordable and very nice. Perfect outing for an afternoon. See lots of animals. Cheetahs can be seen very close",
          "Was looking forward to a 2 hour game drive but was very disappointed. Booked at 2pm with another couple but was kept waiting for over 30 minutes. Then was told more people had arrived so had to change from the jeep to a 15 seater cart which was awful. Struggled to sit",
          "I'm lucky enough to have seen much of the world and now a retired long haul airline pilot with a British airline. Kragga Kamma is one of my favourite places in the world and is by far the best location to have intimate proximity to a good variety of animals in complete safety.",
          "We were so close to the Rhino's that we could almost touch them. Then the herd of Giraffe. What treat. We really enjoyed this excursion just on the outskirts of the city. Highly recommended.",
          "just 20mins from the city centre .ideal for day visitors from abroad that have ltd time in the city.cruise visitors etc.resturant and tea room serving good snacks and simple food.friendly staf who have a passion for conservation.rescued lions to view and cheetah experiences.def",
          "We had a 7 day stay planned in and around Port Elizabeth, with Jeffrey's Bay, Sardinia Bay & trips to Addo already planned and this was an absolute bonus! Saw a surprisingly rich and plentiful selection of African animals; Giraffe, Rhino, Bushpigs, Warthog's, Zebra,",
          "If you love nature and wildlife then you will love it here and if you are at the restaurant at about 12pm they actually feed the Cheetahs",
          "Quiet, peaceful, lovely cabin. Large game reserve. Saw a lot of wild animals. Nice coffee shop with delicious carrot cake.",
          "Yes, it really is just a self drive zoo but well worth the visit. Plenty of buck and giraffe keep sightings fun and frequent for the kids. Cheetah enclosure has good viewing opportunity. The gates are a little tricky with double entrance and exit gates but all safe and ranger",
          "It was a lovely experience to see the animals up close. We even had the opportunity to pat a cheetah \ud83d\ude0a Good idea to take a drive and spend the day outdoors.",
          "Rinos free roaming around in Kraga Kamma Pame Park. So it may happen that they come along for dinner :-) The rinos are coming very close to the chalets. That gives you a unique experience with these animals.",
          "this is a small park, taking only 2 hours to drive around but we saw many animals in fairly close proximity to us and got some great pics",
          "What fun this was for our kids!!! We drove into the park and straight away saw giraffe, wildebeest and zebra, which was so lovely for our young kids who haven\u2019t ever seen these animals except in zoos. It\u2019s the perfect size for young family\u2019s to drive around in as you can",
          "Brilliant venue packed with wildlife. Did not see any lions or cheetahs but had great views of the rhinos drinking water less than 20m from our Jeep. Also saw an enormous Girraffe and passed right underneath its head. Brilliant.place and will visit again soon. We went in the",
          "So glad we went. I assume you will do a larger Safari. Surreal since you self guide by driving through this quaint reserve at the edge of the suburbs of PE. We got \u201ctrapped\u201d with cheetahs in the security gate. Super cool.",
          "Kragga Kamma was among our favourite stopovers and this tour was really good value. Although some of the animals are fed the variety of wild animals roaming free was impressive. Well worth a visit.",
          "Excellent game park to see most of the animals in a few hours like Giraffe, cheetah,monkeys, Rhino, Buffalo and plenty of buck.Nice coffee shop with curios.Well worth a visit",
          "Really nice for a Saturday/Sunday day experience. Saw lots of rhino while we were there. Restaurant was nice but needs more variety on the menu and drinks.",
          "A wonderful compact park close to the city. Because of the size of the park you are able to see almost every animal listed in the park and get up close to them in your car.",
          "This reserve is quite small compared to something like Addo, for example, but they have a great variety of game which is relatively easy to view. Great for inexperienced and experienced game viewers alike.",
          "Did the interaction with Monty the Cheetah, amazing! Staff were so friendly and helpful. Had the rhino, giraffe, zebra, buck right up next to our cabin. Would highly recommend, such a pleasant stay and going back in the near future with friends.",
          "We like this park a lot. Selfdrive is making sense. The real highlight are the tame and wild Cheetahs.",
          "Excellent drive with plenty of animals, although I didn't see a cheetah. Easy to navigate. Good signage. Wide open space makes viewing and photographing the animals easy. Helpful on the phone. I called in route with questions. When I got slightly lost looking for the",
          "Wonderful experience park has my favourite wild animals, cheetahs, and I got to go in with one that purred all over me. Nice restaurant, but be careful eating outside as the monkeys may steal your food.",
          "The Game Drive at the Kragga Kamma Game Park was amazing. There were a lot of animals to see, definitely a must visit. The staff was friendly too.",
          "Kragga Kamma ensures a valuable experience for all. There are guaranteed views of beautiful animals, which also include lions and cheetahs. The park is also near to the city so it\u2019s accessible to all and a natural (as possible) way to see wildlife, and appreciate them.",
          "the view and the animals is amazing to see. take a day and drive out there you will connect with nature",
          "The park is amazing, you can drive by your own through the park and get to see rhinos, lots of deer, giraffes walking by, and many other animals (no SUV is needed, a small automobile would be good for the roads inside the park). There is even an enclosure of cheetahs, that they",
          "Went here for a morning drive with my wife before flying back home from our holiday in PE. Thoroughly enjoyed drive and seeing all the game, particularly the cheetahs",
          "Yes Kragga Kamma Game Park might be a small game park but definitely provides a wow experience when it comes to viewing game and having a fabulous time. Loved listening to the game ranger love the fact that the animals comes first no matter what. Keep up the great conservation",
          "We joined my son and family (4\u00bdyr old twins) at the Rhino Lodge for two nights. On the first evening Rhino visited for 'Sundowners', in the morning Giraffe popped along to see what we were having for breakfast ... and during the day we were visited by Warthog, guinea fowl and an",
          "A \"chill out\" for our daughter, freshly arrived from the UK and a stressful job. Result! No need to even move from the accommodation as animals wander around freely. Driving round is easy and rewarding, the game is abundant and highly visible. The accommodation is basic but",
          "Kragga Kamma wildlife reserve has mixed reviews from travellers. It looks like you either love it or you hate it. We knew exactly what to expect, a small game reserve next to Port Elizabeth, where one can see a lot of wildlife in a short time without driving for hours. Therefore",
          "Kragga Kamma is a rather small Game Area where you can spot some animals in Port Elisabeth. You won\u2019t be able to see the big 5 but rhinos, buffalos and cheetahs are pretty much guaranteed. The whole park can be driven by in about 1,5h in a regular sedan. The coffee place didn\u2019t",
          "Accompanied Dutch journalists on a Game Drive at Kragga Kamma Game park. The park is situated on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth. The Game Ranger Terry was very knowledgeable regarding the animals. A highlight was observing the the Cheetah",
          "A quaint little game park right on my doorstep. Took grandkids and saw ample animals without them getting bored.",
          "It's the wild right on on our suburban doorstep. We've been lucky to see a lot of animals when driving thru. It's a relaxing way to spend a Sunday afternoon and keeps the kids out your hair at the same time. The kids love spotting the animals and ticking them off and compete to",
          "You don't have to travel far to see all sorts of animals. We were privileged to see the cheetah's being fed.",
          "This feels like more of a zoo than an actual game reserve. Yes, the advantage is that it\u2019s only a short drive from PE but it\u2019s not really worth the time. There are electricity pylons around the reserve and the drive is quite limited. No elephants or lions, and the cheetahs are",
          "We finally got to see giraffes on our trip when the manager of the property drove us off the beaten path to where they were. Amazing service and experience!",
          "A trip to Kragga Kamma Game Park was truly worthwhile the effort. A good variety of game and predators were sighted within there habitat as close to the natural as possible. This venue is a \"not to miss\" experience.",
          "We took our grandson there from Dubai. He love the animals and was very exited to see all the giraffes that walk up to the car. There was a buck just born and the mother who help it to stand up. That was also very close to the car. We did not see the leopard in the cage",
          "Granted my trip was back in 2016 but i remember this trip so well. Came here in July of '16 for the day. It was a misty rain at beginning of tour but it cleared up about half way. A lot of the wildlife were under cover but there were a couple that had made appearances. One of my",
          "great experience for tourists but for us South Africans a bit of a waste of time and money, rather go to Addo",
          "Great park to drive through in own car. If you hurry, you can manage, if you take time to watch the animals, you can easily spend 4 hours there. We have seen all the big animals, cheetahs, rhinos, giraffes, zebras, Austriches etc. Excellent value for money.",
          "very nice people, good experience and informative tour. Kindness to the animals. It's not very big so if don;t have much time, this is a good way to see a fair few of the african animals.",
          "Had an up close view of a wide range of animals, it was such a great experience and worthwhile. Didn't take too long as well.",
          "We stayed in Giraffe lodge, for two nights after arriving at Port Elizabeth. Clean, basic accommodation, the staff are so friendly. The lodges have baari but no cental heating, as it was the end of winter it was chilly, but after seeing other parts of South Africa, the residents",
          "We visited on a windy afternoon and were not disappointed we saw all animals and enjoyed the set up of the park. Ranger at cheetah enclosure was great other staff were pretty ordinary. However we had a wonderful adventure",
          "Average - good to see game up close without a long drive. Accommodation basic but very cold in winter",
          "This park feels a bit like visiting a zoo. Yes, you do spot a lot of animals, but it's not their natural habitat, I believe. I guess especially after our visit to Kruger this felt a bit like a disappointment. We did not spend more than one hour there. I can imagine however that",
          "The game drive was nice, roads were fine to a sedan car and there were a lot of close by game all throughout the drive.",
          "We have been returning to the Kragga Kamma game park since 2014. We booked the entire park out for our silver wedding anniversary in 2015. We will be returning to visit friends and animals at the park in Apr 19. Simply cannot wait. Terry and Tanja are amazing and have looked",
          "We experienced a beautiful variety in terrain from open grassy plains to lush filled treed areas. One is able to view a huge variety of wild life without having to drive for hours before viewing any form of life. We were treated to the delights of Cheetah, Rhino, Buffalo,",
          "I went round this game reserve on a quiet day so wasn't affected by other visitors wanting to pass me etc. etc. I can imagine that on busy days this might be a bit of an annoyance as there are few passing spots. The game was stunning - saw most species except Porcupine and",
          "Nature at it's best .... It's not expensive and real value for your money. It's a must do they have variety of animals",
          "What a great experience - we have visited many game parks in Johannesburg but being a little smaller was an advantage for Kragga Kamma as we got to see 90% of the animals they have. The animals come right up to the chalets which is a great experience. Staff are pleasant and the",
          "This park is great if you want to guarantee you'll see rhinos and cheetahs. But they have been bought in and are not as free as in places like Addo. Therefore overall it can be a good day out but the experience is not so genuine for someone who wants to see animals in their",
          "When we were looking for a little daytrip while on our week-end escape in May 2018 it took a local to point out the Kraggakamma Game Park a few minutes away from the city. What a quaint little Game Park that has that included rhino, cheetah,bontebok,and even some very dangerous",
          "The fact that you get to drive in your own vehicle so you get to choose your own pace whilst viewing the various animals. Very relaxed drive. Been there twice already and kids enjoy everytime.",
          "visited the park a week ago on the spur of the moment as it's \"just around the corner\". We always love our visits there. Saw giraffe, rhino, zebra, buffalo and loads of buck. Lunch was great. On the down-side - We noticed a huge increase of invasive / alien plants - the park",
          "We had dinner on Richmond Hill and started talking to a local who told us about Kragga Kamma Game Park. He told us we would see a lot of animals in a relatively small area including cheetahs. We decided to check it out the next day. It was a 30 minute drive from Port Elizabeth",
          "Spent 3 hours here driving around and made sure we got here in time for the Cheetah feeding. There are lots of birds and animals to see and in such a compact park. Make sure you drive slowly as you will see things appear in front of your eyes. Make sure you are not just",

          "Easy to follow roads and well maintained area. Locals rather skip this and take a drive to bigger parks",
          "I took a visit to this park as I had virtually a spare day. It takes about an hour to drive from the PE beachfrontHi , its not so far, but stick to the speed limits. Entrance is R90 and you get a brochure that indicates what game you can see. As soon as I entered I saw lots,",
          "A smaller sized park where your vehicle follows a road and paths to view the assorted wildlife. Great viewing in close to most of the animals compared to being on a guided safari. The animals are free to move about and some great sightings throughout the park. If you are",
          "We really didn't know what to expect with this. In fact, a few locals told us not to go as it wasn't that great. But we didn't listen, and we're so glad! This was an amazing experience, we would do it again (and again). Getting so close to the animals, but being in their",
          "This place when I visited for the 1st time, I was amazed to see the well maintained land and healthy animals being really taken care of. This place is just a heaven on earth, filled with nature. Well fenced and good security system. Also, excellent assistance by the crew",

          "We visited this private reserve in January and the viewing of the animals was fantastic mainly due to the excellent knowledge and explanations of our guide, Gert. We have experienced a considerable number of game reserves in South Africa and, although smaller than most, Kragga",

          "Our visit to this park was a huge surprise. We were fortunate enough to get Tanya as a guide and this knowledgeable young lady kept us informed about all the many animals we saw. Added to this she has a wonderful sense of humour which we enjoyed thoroughly. Thank you Tanya, we",

          "We had a great family outing at the game park. Saw a large variety of animals and this really made our day. Driving around and frequently seeing different animals made this so much fun. The cafe area and the walk are both well worth visiting and doing too. Great place to",

Soon after we entered we were greeted by a herd of Giraffes, zebra\u2019s and various deer\u2019s and in the distance we could see Wildebeest \u2018s . We then drove on and passed closely by herd of Buffalo and then a",

          "Kragga Kamma is a small Game Park and as such is good value for your money. It is ideal for photo opportunities as the roads give you the opportunity to shoot from either side, so it does not matter if you are there in the morning or afternoon. It is also very easily accessible",

          "A nice little park near Port Elizabeth. We booked an overnight in one of the chalets in the park and had a rhine walking past when we woke up in the morning. As there a no lions or elephants, he chalets are in the park between the animals. There was a construction going on",

          "We took our two grandchildren to visit the Park and what fun did they have. At the ages of 3 and 4 they could nearly identify all the animals that they saw. The best for them however was seeing the Cheetahs. Ivony has a love of any large cat and seeing the cheetahs made her",
          "Me and my boyfriend went to Kragga Kamma for the day. It is well sign posted so you need to look as the sat nav took us a different way. The road is quite bumpy down to the entrance so take it slow if you have a nice car. Entry fee is really cheap 80R. The drive it'self is",

          "The game reserve is a must do if you want to see wild animals in a short period of time. It's much better than a zoo environment but not as cool as Addo National Park. We spent personal time with the Cheetah which was awesome",
          "So relaxing & refreshing to self-drive around this beautiful game park while viewing the animals. We always enjoy a picnic afterwards in the designated area. A must-do for locals (like us) and we've been proud to take our international guests there.",

          "We went to this park and had a really great experience. We booked a game reserve tour with a jeep and our guide was really dedicated to show us all animals, plants & trees. The park isn't the biggest but definitely worth it when you stay in PE.",
          "We visited this place using NMB pass cards. It was amazing afternoon! This park is full of animals - especially very photogenic giraffes and rhinos. Roads are clearly marked and in good condition. It's not very \"wild\" place but definitely worthy to visit if you don't have much",
          "Stayed two nights at Kragga Kamma Game Park in the Rhino Lodge. Comfortable and relaxed accommodation. Game park was a great experience and the animals come up to your front window. Would recommend to families and couples looking a spend a few days away. Great value , wonderful",

          "We went just after midday and paid our R80 each. Hadn\u2019t gone more than a couple of hundred metres and there were the animals. A compact game park where we saw rhinos, giraffes, cheetahs and lots of different antelopes. We had a very pleasant well cooked tasty lunch so all",
          "I stayed for 2 nights at Kragga Kamma, and really enjoyed my stay. I got to see all manner of wildlife strolling past my cabin, and the Cheetah's were awesome. Some WiFi boosters to extend the range to the accommodation would be nice, as while many of us are looking to get away",
          "We were so lucky to see the new baby rhino, born just Yesterday. This is a wonderful experience and we thoroughly enjoyed our self drive through the park.",
          "Animals are not shy and quite tame. They seem to like posing for photos. Unfortunately, found the restaurant to be a bit on the expensive side although the food was good.",

          "I thoroughly enjoyed the late afternoon-evening trip to this place - first we had a 2-h drive in a park-owned vehicle, with a very knowledgeable and informative guide who clearly liked his job. We saw different antelope species, ostriches, rhinos, buffaloes, wildebeest, zebra",

          "Again Kagga Kamma left me breathless. My family and myself went for a visit in the Cederberg and we decide to make it a wide drive to Kagga Kamma on Heritage day. What a pleasant surprise await us! Without any knowledge prior our visit. they had a really big thing going on for",
          "Have heard about this place before, but never bothered to go. My grand kids visited and I thought a good idea to take them. I was not disappointed at all.We went early--they open at 8am and close at 5pm. We were given a map and a \"gallery\" of all the different species",
          "Nice environment that accommodates the kids aswell. When we arrived there were school tours. They have a safe environment. Around the park you saw park attendants which made you feel safe if anything were to happen. It's a beautiful, peaceful place you just want to park and have",
          "Been here several times. The herbivorous section of the park is good. Especially the Rhinos. And the wildebeests which I haven\u2019t spotted in any other game park in PE. The cheetah enclosure is a small area you drive into. And yet out of the many times that I\u2019ve driven in, I\u2019ve",

          "It's nice for a short drive in the car with the kids, especially considering it's not too far from town. The restaurant is simple, with a deck and day visitor braai facilities. It won't keep you entertained the entire day, but depending how slowly you drive it'll take a few",
          "Visited Kragga K this week and loved being able to view such a wide range of game up close in short distance. The cheetah interaction was a wonderful experience and ranger extremely knowledgeable. Highly recommend visit if in the area.",

          "After every corner you will see more animals and the kids get more and more excited by noting all the species they see on the flyer that you get at the entrance. It is of course a great event for the whole Family. I saw some guests doing the ride with a mini cooper and it seemed",
          "Fantastic place . enjoyed the game drive and the overall experience! Recommend a stay here for families.",

          "On a cold weekend in PE we embarked on our first game range trip. This was an experience not to be missed. Beautiful wildlife, in a natural setting, but protected. We had an extremely informative tour guide. There was an option for a photo opp with a cheetah ( I was not brave",

          "What an experience! Kragga Kamma is a smaller private game park, but nonetheless spacious enough to habitate loads of different animals. Just after entering we have seen zebras, giraffes, buffaloes and a variety of bock species. Even a rhino family with a baby and cheetahs are",
          "This facility offers a game viewing experince in the center of a city so to say. They have a large variety of game on view including Rhino. The restuarant provides very tasty and enjoyable meals to those wanting a bite half way through which I highly reccommend.",

          "Although its nothing like Addo Park we still enjoyed it. The proximity to animals made it worthwhile. Rhinos(with a baby), giraffes,zebras, antelopes of any kind, buffalos, warthogs. All of them were just next our car just passing by. On the dry day you can definitely drive any",
          "Sorry but this 'game park' is on the urban periphery and really is nothing like the rolling grassland described on the website. An electricity substation on one edge and powerlines framing the piece of open grassland where the African savannah animals congregate does detract",
          "Amazing experience for young kids.The closeness of the animals was to them larger than life. We would recommend every time.",
          "If you manage to get a shady spot under the trees you are sorted. This is not far from the city centre but makes you feel like your miles from home. Always guaranteed to see some game animals as it is a small park. Roads are a bit bumpy though. Small restaurant menu on site -",
          "After looking for something to do in PE finally found this. Fun for the whole family. Called and spoke to a friendly lady who assured me that the park is sedan and hatch friendly. Turns out little lady was lying through her teeth. Ride started off fine and manageable. Then",
          "I'm happy to drive around Kragga Kamma (in my 4x4). I think I have seen all the animals, it's not really a big park. It's very nice though.",
          "i stayed for a brief spell at the Kragga Kamma tented camp... the experience was very rustic but most enjoyable. The tent slept 2 and had a bathroom and all necessities however no luxuries, tv etc... game veiwing was good and game drives are available.",
          "We did the self drive tour and were okay with that. We had wanted to do a guided tour but when we arrived we learned they didn't start until 10:00a.m. and we would have had to prebook. We didn't know that. They said we could do the drive in our small car. Which was true for the",
          "Enjoyed seeing the month old baby Rhino a few times today. My granddaughter of 3 enjoyed the bush walk near the restaurant.",
          "Other than the fact that it's a little busy, understandably, as it's in season, we had a fantastic time! It was a relaxing drive and we saw a wonderful variety of animals. The Monkey Walk was awesome but the highlight for us was seeing the rhino up close.... absolutely loved it!",
          "If you're tiered of looking for animals in Addo, go to this game park and book a guided tour. You'll see all the animals you've missed in Addo for a very reasonable price.",
          "It was really a great experience with my kids. We also used our own car to drive around the park. Truly amazing.",
          "What a great experience! Teaming with animal life! Ample water birds. We saw many antelope: springbuck, impala, wildebeest, waterbuck, bontebok, buffalo etc. Young zebra were frolicking. Rhino were seen but were lying down. Amazing cheetah enclosure. Many bush pigs. The giraffe",
          "Wonderful gameviewing, roads are good, restaurant needs attention. Love the Cheetah enclosure. Have stayed here overnight as well on a couple of occasions in self catering accommodation, great facilities.",
          "My 5 year old daughter had so much fun ticking off the different animals we saw. She absolutely loved the idea of being to close to all the BIG animals.. especially the Giraffes. What a wonderful family outing",
          "It was the fifth time we visit this fantastic Game Reserve. It is located so close to the city, easy to arrive. The children were absolute happy seeing all the animals they could spotted. We always enjoy this adventure.",
          "The amount of animals seen was brilliant and quite close up well worth a visit . The friendly staff at the cafeteria and the food was very reasonable, will be back again",
          "For visitors with limited time, this is an ideal opportunity to see wildlife, especially rhino & cheetah :)",
          "We went here to enjoy seeing animals with little time on our hands and we weren't dissapointed! We stayed at the park overnight and had all sorts of animals right at our doorstep (litteraly!). We also took the tour (2 hours) giving us a close up view on the animals. Its not the",
          "We had visited Addo but missed seeing the rhino. In addition there are no giraffe at Addo as they are not indigenous to the Eastern Cape. Hence our decision to do a 2 hour early morning visit to Kragga Kamma and we were not disappointed. The Park is near Port Elizabeth and you",
          "M son and I enjoyed a Sunday outing to Kragga Kamma Game Park. We saw 80% of the animals there. I got beautiful close up shots of the Rhino's, Buck and Buffalo. Pity we didn't encounter the Cheetahs in the Cheetah drive through enclosure but did see them from the Monkey Walkway",
          "This is an amazing place to visit if you are short on time, but still want to have a great experience viewing animals. You will see rhino, giraffe, all kinds of buck, buffalo, cheetah, to mention just a few. You will not be disappointed.",
          "Beautiful animal viewing and excellent restaurant, staff are friendly and Diane was very informative",
          "We stayed at Impala log cabin high up on the hill, with a view overlooking the fields. From the deck we could see the animals coming down early in the morning and again in the evening. Our first view of the animals was within 30 seconds of passing the entrance gate. Checking in",
          "We saw almost the same animals here that we did on an expensive guided tour of Amakhala, it's not the same as being driven around and having the exact type of buck or bird pointed out, but at the end of the day you still see the animals! Definitely worth a visit, wether you have",
          "Do not go for the basic rooms - we upgraded after checking in, it was very cold and windy and very far up a beaten track and the room was merely a bed with a toilet. The upgrade wasn't much more but it at least was near the animals. Could really do with upgrading things a bit.",
          "Loved the cheetah. Pay a little more and you can pet this magnificent animal. Purred like a little kitten....",
          "pent two restful nights with friends and stayed at the Cheetah & Rhino Chalets. The Chalets were very basic but comfortable and clean. It was very pleasant walking on the walkways viewing the cheetah sanctuaries and we saw lots of game on our drives. I think this game reserve is",
          "This is targeted more for smaller children. There is a nice albeit scary cheetah sanctuary in the middle. The drives around the park was nothing to brag about. good for a half day visit. I would rather plan a trip to the Van stadens Pass for some epic nature adventure.",
          "Really had a great time. So many animals to see & got quite close to them. We did the self drive around the park and was not disappointed. All the animals roam freely round the park. After looking at the animals we went to the Bush Cafe and again was not disappointed. Such a",

          "Booked to go around the reserve with a guide in a safari vehicle. Well worth it - was about R240 so not expensive - as had a very informative guide. Actually got to see a Knysna Loerie in the forest area which are apparently quite shy. Saw lots of wildlife including baby",

          "We visited this park after we had visited Addo wildlife sanctuary. Addo was more spectacular and vast,where as this park was a lot smaller with lots of different varieties of animals all in a close proximity. Nevertheless this was a very good park with lots to do and see Highly",
          "we had a wonderful time driving around the park and we saw plenty animals. We also had a private encounter with the cheetah which was a once in a lifetime experience.",

          "I haven't been to Kragga Kamma Game Park in a few years and took overseas visitors (family of 5) for their first ever SA game park experience. It was fantastic! Cheap as chips to get into the park, great roads and fabulous animals (saw loads of buck, giraffe, warthog, rhino, and",

          "stunning venue - very close to town but once inside game park so peaceful - definitely a must for all outdoor lovers",
          "This is a good game reserve to go with the family. Many animals and they all look healthy and happy with their environment.",
          "We were recommended the Park by our host and what a brilliant recommendation it was. Within easy reach of the city and just off off the Kragga Kamma Road, we could easily find the Park and after paying our very reasonable entrance fee the \"safari\" could begin. With our little",

          "Saw newly born rhino as well as giraffe along with many stunning other animals. The drive through is beautiful and if you do it very slowly there is much more to see than just game,there the Birds and all the stunning wetland areas with the geese and all the sounds that Kids",
          "Really enjoyed this park. It's not too far from Port Elizabeth and seeing amazing animals is guaranteed. It's small, so it'll probably doesn't take you more than 2 to 3 hours to see everything. One thing we were really disappointed with was how a female staff member treated the",
          "what an absolutely beautiful place. I was blown away just driving in because there were so many different kinds of animals in my path. It was actually breathtaking. Once arriving at our chalet we were greeted by giraffes at our front door. I don't know anywhere else where you",
          "From what I've heard this game park is the, by locals, most visited game park of the area and I can see why. The park might be small but there is plenty to see. The total loop does not take more than a few hours but will give you stunning views of Giraffes, Zebra, Cheetah's and",
          "Viewing the game was lovely. I would go back for that and a picnic. We stayed at Impala - it is nice because of the view, but I feel it is overpriced. If the accommodation was R100 less per person I would definitely go back. I also feel it is a rip off to charge people, who",

          "We really enjoyed our visit and in fact I have been back twice since my first visit. There is quite a variety of game to be seen here remembering it is literally 5 minutes from Port Elizabeth. It doesn't home the big five but there is more than enough wildlife and the kids will",
          "Visited here and drove thru park...easy to view animals and saw quite a variety. Didn't see any monkeys in monkey walk area though. Facilities are nice and clean ....restroom and cafe....you can even pick up souvenirs. Would recommend for families etc. Nice smaller park.",
          "We took a group of orphans to visit the facility. It was expensive and unfriendly at the gate. The restaurant was below average. You have to make your own coffee and then pay them for it. Not a good experience. The park itself was fun for the kids. So we suggest a picnic basket",
          "What I found particularly nice is it's close proximity to PE. There is a good selection of game including some of the 'big-and-hairy's'. The roads are good enough to visit in any vehicle. Some good photographic opportunities on the reserve. It's worth visiting.",
          "So much to see so close to home. Accommodation was private and makes one feel like you are part of nature. Loved it!",
          "This is a great half-day outing in Port Elizabeth especially if you have kids. You can get relatively close to most of the wildlife and there is good visibility throughout the park.",
          "My second time back to PE. First time they had the newborns. I enjoyed that much more. The black leopard is sill there. It is ok for a drive out.",
          "Call this a peri-urban game park as it is not far out of town. Small, but a nice drive through the property and an adequate number of game were seen, including Cheetahs, from the deck of the restuarant. I felt a visit here passed the time nicely. The roads are a bit rough but",
          "While Kragga Kamma might not be the Kruger National Park, we enjoyed our stay immensely. It is a little like Noah's Ark with all the animals being so close. This place is perfect for young children who might lose patience on long game drives. No matter which loop you take you",
          "This park is not Kruger, it is not Addo. If that is what you are looking for you may be disappointed. However, if you only have half a day and really want to see some wildlife this park is amazing. It is a 25-30 minute trip out of Port Elizabeth (depending on the traffic) and it",
          "We had a stunning day at Kragga Kamma. Amazing sightings. Good roads. Well maintained reserve. We saw rhino, cheetah, nyala, giraffe, zebra, blue wildebeest, monkeys, waterbuck and more. A fantastic day out for the family.",
          "A huge amount of animals to be seen in a short space of time, so even worth going for a day trip great for little ones as they dont get bored plenty of different buck species,which are not in addo . Cheetah, Giraffe a bonus . Its perfect for children or people who don't want to",
          "We took my father and our boys who are 6 and 9. Close up views of everything- including all the rhinos and giraffes on the road on the way home. Highlights- all the cheetahs, baby rhinos, buffalo- everything was great.",
          "Loved this place. Been twice and seen a range of different animals every time. Nice cafe, very chilled and great to be as close to cheetahs as we were. At one point 8 around the car and I can't help think I was part of the menu that day!",
          "I have been to the park a few times and have enjoyed everyone. Plenty to see. Animals in good condition. Beautiful place.",
          "Its all about cheetah's. Private owned park has several animals, giraffe, ostrich, kudu etc. but if its good animal sightseeing i loved Addo Elephant park for such. At kragga Kamma it's exciting for upclose Cheetah viewing and Giraffes. Its a small cosy park.",
          "We went to the Kragga Kamma Game Park not knowing what to expect. What a lovely surprise! Within minutes we had come across rhino, which are not that easy to see these days with all the poaching that is occurring. Followed by a herd of buffalo and then a lone secretary bird",
          "Having had three sets of visitors over the past two months, an elderly Aunt and Uncle from the UK included, I've been fortunate to be the chosen \"tour guide\" and visit the game park each time. We love it and so did they...well kept, clean and easily accessible, this is most",
          "In this small game park you see a lot of animals by nearly guarantee. For example Rhinos and Cheetahs (which you don't see quite often in the big parks). The landscape is awesome and there's also a restaurant included where you can have a drink and maybe even get served at",

          "Basic accommodation but with everything you need to enjoy a break-away. A huge amount of animals to be seen in a short space of time, so even worth going for a day trip. Game drives by very competent rangers makes this a great option. Giraffe and many other animals came right up",
          "This has quickly become a number one trip out for our visitors, The game viewing is excellent, with friendly cheetahs, lots of buck and adventurous drives. Not the place for a low slung family saloon - there are no paved roads and the dirt roads are sandy and uneven. - we did",
          "We have tried addo a couple of times but this place beats it hands down. For a start is us a fraction of the cost. The staff are friendly. The bri area is excellent. Animals are always around It is close to PE. The views are amazing Love it.",
          "We stayed at the game reserve and what a wonderful experience. Accommodation Accommodation was very basic with minimal utensils, however was suitable for a 3 night stay. Mattresses are deep foam - so not a great sleep! If you are afraid of bugs, take insect repellant. If you",
          "I always feel disappointed when I go here. For a bit extra time / money I feel it is worth it rather going to Addo a Elephant park. I never really see great wildlife here and the restaurant is a bit tacky / old school.",

          "The Kragga Kamma reserve is definitely nice. You can spot all the registered animals up close and very easily. The chita and rhino made the strongest impression on us. Besides the place is relative small. The roads aren't good at all, so if you care about your private take the",

          "When we visited, the park was empty. Nice to drive around and do done animal spotting. Liads of open spaces and the cat walks were an enjoyable relief to ket little legs burn off excess energy. Nice to see Rhino and Cheetah wandering around and not in small cages. There is a",
          "Looking for something to do on a not quite perfect beach day we headed to the little haven of Kragga Kamma. This is a safari lite with lite prices and well worth a short detour if you are heading for the Garden Routes main attractions. There is a good variety of animals, all of",
          "For the price it was worth seeing the animals up close, but really not many photographic opportunities - with buildings, electric cabling and substations in frames. Was fun seeing two rhino playing,but the place was a bit messy with garbage heaps being burnt.. Meh.. I'd give it",
          "Simply seeing the animals roaming freely is a really great experience. We took the guided tour which is really worth the extra money. The guide was very good, he had great knowledge and a good sense of humour too, it's amazing just how much you can learn in 2 hours. The",

          "My boyfriend and i decided to try it out, most game reserves are so expensive but we paid like R60 per person and had such a great time driving around slowly and seeing all the animals (self drive) as we drove in there were huge giraffes right next to our car we could reach",
          "So close to town. Perfect for children or people who don't want to sit in the car all day. Lots of animals and even though you are close to town they have lots of grazing and all look well fed and happy. Have taken lots of overseas visitors and they have all thoroughly enjoyed",

          "What a beautiful experience . it feels as though you are far out of PE in the wild somewhere, whereas it is close to the city centre. The wildlife is amazing and present a lot of photo opportunities. Lots of species to see. I used my normal little Toyota Tazz to get around and",

          "Kragga Kamma is a small game park right on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth. As such, whether you are staying in the city or flying in, no lengthy drives are involved in reaching it. Our GPS initially led us astray when using map info from Google Maps, but as is the norm in South",
          "We had our own ranger on this visit and she was very good with a lot of knowledge about the animals. I didn't see any monkeys unfortunately but got to hold rhino poo! A good few hours seeing zebras elephants wart hogs and rhino",

          "Kragga Kamma is great for seeing a lot of the animals SA is famous for - there's loads of giraffes, zebras, rhino, wildebeest, buck etc. It is very reasonably priced when you self drive. Some of the roads through the forest part are pretty bumpy so if you have a rental car drive",
          "Unfortunately one of the loops were closed due to heavy rains and road damage the night before but all in all well worth the visit if you are in the area. Large diversity of animals can be seen in a short period of time.",

          "Fantastic to finally sight some rhinos, on our last morning in PE. A great mini-game park at Kragga Kamma, especially also being able to see giraffes and cheetahs up close. The water buffalos were very cool and we got the feeling that they knew where we were at all times. Hope",
          "First day had a rhino with a baby at our chalet. The baby where so playful , kept us entertained. Just at the chalet we had warthogs, giraffe, nyala , ostrich, monkeys , springbok. The best is the eight cheetah that lay waiting to be fed around 4h30 all of them on a cliff",
          "Within 5 minutes of entering the park we saw giraffe, zebra, rhino, tortoise and a few species of buck. We saw most of the animals on the checklist, that they give you at the gate. The roads are not tarred inside the park but they are not too bad in a normal road going vehicle.",
          "What a treat. My first ever wild drive and boy did I have a wild time. The animals are within touching distance from you. I enjoyed the entire trip from seeing the smallest monkey to the longest giraffe to the biggest rhino. This is a little taste of heaven. If you ever in Port",

          "The size of the park makes it possible to see animals easily even on a short visit. All animals run loose with the only predators - cheetahs - in a separate enclosure. Thoroughly enjoyed my short Sunday afternoon visit.",
          "We did the guided drive through the park. You definitely see more and learn more when on the tour truck. Also they go off road to get you closer to the animals which you can't do when you self-drive. The park is small so you can see everything easily. They've also got a baby",
          "We loved our visit to this game park. We were a little suspicious of whether it would be much of anything, with its location being in the heart of Port Elizabeth. But it was fantastic, and within moments of entering, we saw buck, giraffe and zebra. We were fortunate to see",

          "The feeling of driving so closely between the wild animals was a fantastic experience! I absolutely loved the giraffes. The Restaurant has a lot to offer and walking across the bridge to be closer to the cheetahs and to take a nice walk further in save surroundings was so",

          "I have visited this Park on numerous occasions and have always been impressed. We usually do the self-drive option, which is great as we can do it at our pace and spend time looking at the animals we enjoy. I once did the game drive option and it was a hit with the kids, and",
          "It was really a great experience! Indeed! Though the weather that time was not so ok but then, the staff were still very accommodating. Our guide/driver (terry) was very much informative. She was so kind that even the road was so muddy and it was hard to drive, she still managed",
          "Great selection of animals in close proximity to Port Elizabeth. You can see many animals within an hour's game drive. Great little restaurant too. The monkey-walk is also a great experience. Won't recommend it after heaps of rain as the roads will be difficult to navigate.",

          "I did find many animals when I went",
          "Cheap and great for a 2-3 hour visit. Excellent!",
          "It didn't take long to find the animals.",
          "Wow what a beautiful incredible experience. Our driver Chris gave us all the best spots",
          "Enjoyable as always. A good variety of animals easily seen but without a zoo feel. The kids love it. The lamb curry was also excellent as was the Red Cappuccino.",
          "It's smaller size adds to the experience.\nThe dirt roads seem to keep the traffic slow and comfort the animals, as they tend to hang-out right in the middle of the roads. The only draw-back was we didn't get to see the monkey's in the monkey walk.",
          "Not the biggest game park,but still a decent amount to see and do. Definitely worth it if you have not been. Roads are in fair condition and you do not need a 4 wheel drive vehicle to access it.",
          "Good game park nice animals and views friendly people its a place to be alot of animals to see",
          "Beautiful and tranquil",
          "A lot of animals to see",
          "Compact with nice animals. Good with children.  Cheetahs were a hit.",
          "Fantastic Place. Since it is not big like other National parks, you can drive and see many animals. They are there overall.\nThe lions are less active and it is harder to find them.\nThe cheetahs are also hard because the space for them is \u2026",
          "Great birthday gift",
          "Amazing family destination",
          "Great game farm with a huge biodiversity. In a few hours you can see what would take a few days at other reserves.",
          "What a lovely place, right on your door step.",
          "Place was perfect. Wanting to go again",
          "Game park of note within a city.",
          "Very good to visit.",
          "Driving your own car through the game park is really nice, to see the different animals! The caf\u00e9 is rather expensive and there are no hot drinks during load shedding.",
          "amazing 4x4 and animals thriving",
          "Lovely place, and close to home.",
          "Such a lovely drive amidst some animal life... pity the housing developments making the 'wild' life less so, more 'boxed in' specimens from the wild. But I get the conservation element, and.. but... so... I also feel discomfort. The story about the lions attests, thank you regardless of my personal reaction.",
          "Amazing",
          "I love that you can see the animals in their natural habitat! I also love the brosjure where you can mark all the animals you saw on your adventure. It also gives you a guideline of what animals to suspect. Welldone I can see you take much care of the animals",
          "Wonderful experience seeing the animals. Went on a self-drive and enjoyed it very much with family. Saw so many animals: cheetah, rhino, vervet monkey, warthog and a variety of buck.",
          "Love this little piece of paradise on our doorstep!",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kragga Kamma. Hard to believe that this is just 10 minutes outside of PE. We stayed in the Cheetah Lodge and we had rhino, warthog, ostriches, and bontebok stop by at the watering hole that was just outside our Lodge. Highly recommend this to visitors and residents of PE.",
          "I am so glad I got to know of the Kragga Kamma Game Reserve after googling \"things to do\" in Port Elizabeth. This is the perfect hide-away if you want to break away from the city for a day or two. Waking up to zebras and rhinos under our balcony was magical and I regret not staying longer.",
          "Awesome animal sightings. Lovely forest walk. You can interact with Cheetas which some youngsters did. Park small bit plenty animals.",
          "Loved it. Timing about 2 hours so you don't get bored. Animal sightings definitely.",
          "Very nice view, however the road is not for a small/low car, only if it is very dry. If you go there after a rain, you need a 4x4, but not a very big one, as the road is in some turns very narrow and some sor of walls are formed on the sides, so you might get some scratches or dents. Other than that beautiful.",
          "A wonderful game park so close to the city of port elizabeth. Lovely coffee/gift shop and offers accommodation. See some of south African wildlife. If you are brave enough why not have your photo taken with a Cheetah.",
          "Must go to place for a game drive",
          "Love Kragga Kamma? Always an amazing, educational experience. All round breath of fresh air being out amongst our earthly given gifts of nature.",
          "Amazing place. Wonderful drive through the park. So much wildlife to see",
          "Fantastic place. Really enjoyed it",
          "Fantastic value for money!",
          "What a lovely day to ride amoung animals and get a card to mark each one off as you spot them, rhino that block the road so you can have a longer look at them. The lions that have arrived to hear them purr. Then you can either a lovely lunch on the deck or a little picnic while the kids play in the play park.",
          "I'm looking for this type of shoes.\nAny one knows where can I get it",
          "Lovely game park. Saw most of the animals that reside at the park. \nAlso got to see the cheetahs during feeding time.\nFriendly staff",
          "It's so great to have a Game Park on our door step.  Lovely selection of wildlife and great cafe for a morning tea or lunch!",
          "I enjoyed the rhinos very much. What a huge beast that is. Great park for the value of money. I go there once every year.",
          "Can't wait for our next visit. Feeling so close to God made me realise how small I really am",
          "A wonderful variety of game. Well maintained and cared for facility.",
          "Amimals are beautifull and looked after! Worth the visit!",
          "We saw so many animals and most were extremely close to our vehicles. Great for pictures of animals. Easy to navigate through the park. We saw more animals than we did when we went to Addo.",
          "Apart from few roaming animals I didn't see anything. Ticket entry, drive thru or take a ride with separate ticket of 200r. There are no games as such, park name is misguiding.",
          "The Kragga Kamma Game Park is a reliable must-see. If you wish to entertain guests or take your children out for the day, you will never be disappointed...the animals are readily found and clearly visible. Well worth visiting this Park!",
          "I loved the tame tiger who allowed me to stroke its head. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and friendly. The restaurant is cosy too.",
          "Could do more maintenance wise and the monkey walkway was nothing special animalwise to see although the nature and its effects was beautiful. Overall not a place to overlook for an outing. Also special to be able to touch the cheetah.",
          "The great wild life viewing within the Port Elizabeth city limits. A reasonably priced outing for the whole family.",
          "I was very disappointed at the service we received at the restaurant. Made a booking for the father's day Sunday lunch but to our disappointment we waited over an hour for our food. Others were served who came in after us. Not sure if it were not the preferred kinda people to visit there.",
          "Great time. Lots of animals.",
          "Beautiful and wonderful nature",
          "Wonderful",
          "\ud83d\udc4d One good place to visit, it's nice for small, big, Jong and old just truly one fantastic place to see or visit \ud83d\udc4d\u270c\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89!",
          "Game always plentyful to see!",
          "Excellent. Saw a lot of animals including the baby Rhino",
          "Nice park and we were able to see 70% of the animals in the park. It sounds like there's an industrial park beyond the hill, which is quite disturbing. But all in all a good experience with bbq facilities and fairly close to town.",
          "What a pleasant treat for the grannies and cramps to take the little one's",
          "Absolutely amazing! What a little gem. Totally worth every penny, and the don't charge much (R65 for adults & R30 for kids). We saw  white rhino 5 mins in. In fact we saw most of the approximately 25 mammals in the first 30 mins. The smallish park definitely contributes to an great wildlife viewing adventure.",
          "Nice",
          "A gloroous day for a safari. Our game drive was great, with good sightings and knowledge sharing.",
          "Wanna see the Big Five? This is your altimate destination!",
          "Was just perfect for a 3 hour tour",
          "My kids and I love the outdoors and animals and this is the perfect place to find that peace in the \"wild\" and nature one needs to revitalize your soul \ud83e\udd92\ud83e\udd81\ud83e\udd93",
          "Amazing fun morning out on our doorstep. So many animals. Very well run. Highly recommended.",
          "Big park with lots of animals.",
          "Beautiful place with chance to see rhinos from very close distance. Having Giraffes, zebras, chittas and many more",
          "Best place to spend time with family.",
          "Great experience as usual.",
          "Nature reserve with lots of cheetah and lions.  Well worth the drive.",
          "Nice park, does not require 4x4, good game viewing possibilities",
          "The family love the drive and picnic spot.",
          "One of those good places",
          "Nice place for family outing",
          "One issue with game parks is that sometimes you need quite a lot of time to spot animals in the wild, but this small game park park is simply fantastic in that you can see a lot of animals in a short time, and yet it feels like a real game park in the wild",
          "Nice experience, managed to see a lot of animals there. Road was not that friendly to my sedan but i really enjoyed the drive. ",
          "I find the Game ride very educational and professional experience.if U go by yourself you see half what is there.rhe Guide taking one around was exceptional with info about the place",
          "Lots of animals to see, convenient location, kids love popping out for a game drive.",
          "A very good experience, and we got close to the animals",
          "Idyllic, calm animals. Diverse in nature. Potentially suitable for families because there are sites within the park where it's possible to BBQ and small playground.",
          "This is a must-visit when in Port Elizabeth !  Only a 10 min drive away from town and a truly authentic game drive.  Everything you'll see in Kruger, minus the elephants.  You drive yourself through the game reserve.  If you have kids, they will absolutely love it.  A fullout recommendations, do visit !",
          "Excellent park with plenty of animals.\n\nThe drive around, while doable in a sedan, is a bit rough. \n\nThe animals are plentiful and relatively comfortable with a car going by, so driving around to get photos is quite easy.\n\nThey have cheetas \u2026",
          "Always a awesome day out",
          "We enjoyed the day at Kragga Kamma Game Park.",
          "The park isn't huge so it's relatively easy to spot many animals.\nI'd say to allow you 3 hours to do the tour!\nThey look good and healthy and absolutely accustomed to visitors so not afraid of cars.\nOnly in few areas is allowed to get out \u2026",
          "Always great to visit the park!!",
          "I loved going back and I will be back again",
          "Interesting Game Reserve",
          "Not sufficient signages into he road to know which is the flow of traffic.other than worth the price",
          "Absolutely spectacular! The park isn't very big but it allows for more opportunities to see more animals! Will definitely be back again.",
          "Awesome Game Park - We stayed there for 2 nights (the houses haven seen quite some visitors over the years) but the friendly and carrying staff is outstanding. It takes around 2 hours to drive around and you get soooo close to soooo many \u2026",
          "We were very lucky to see every animal they have. Including the beautiful newborn babies. All of them",
          "Me and my family love going for the game drive and having a braai after",
          "great place so organised and clean and saw lots of animals.",

          "Great experience of seeing the animals in their natural surroundings.",
          "Great for wildlife experience",
          "Great sitings",
          "very small area but loaded with a variety of wildlife and fabulous chalets to spend the night in. we love kragga kamma \u2764",
          "Always worth a visit, for its location close to PE they have a diverse animal population. And the only place around that you can pet a cheetah. ($150R) they have good roads that most cars can make (though can be a bit rough when it rains) \u2026",
          "Got close up to the animals. Cheatah enclosure a disappointment did not see any in a small enclosure",
          "Must see! Excellent value for money. Lots of animals. Easy to spot them. Up close with Cheetahs at the restaurant. Nice picnic facilities. Ablutions clean and tidy.",

          "Excellent Experience!!!",
          "An amazing game reserve.",
          "I enjoyed my stay here.  It was lovely waking up to Rhinos outside the window in the morning. My only reason for the 4 stars is because of the gate curfew, which we didn\u2019t know about until we got there :(. The gate closes at 5pm and you can\u2019t exit the park after that time.",
          "Many animals. Love this place. Saw about 7 cheetahs also. They gave us a bit of a show :)",
          "Beautiful and amazing place. Unique experience.",
          "One of the highlights of our trip. The reserve is well maintained and you get to see all the animals. Though lions and Cheetah are kept within boundaries rest all animals like rhino, giraffe, buffaloes, wrath dogs, ostrich, and other type \u2026",
          "Beautiful park with plenty animals",
          "Awesome park, they had 3 of the big 5.",

          "The best game drive ever! You see things in such close proximity and we didn't have to drive to search for the animals we literally saw everything while driving in for breakfast that was so cool.

          "Stay away from the restaurant where half the menu is not available and an egg (breakfast) cant be served after 11. Snack baskets, some drinks and vegan shakes not available. Does not really leave a lot to choose. Disappointing.",
          "Still the best game reserve very close to Port Elizabeth. You don't have to drive far to see a wide variety of animals. The animals are easy to spot and you get a pamphlet to mark off what you have seen and helps you identify the animals. Be at the restaurant by midday to see the cheetah's being fed.",
          "A great family outing. The animals are easy to spot and you see plenty. The monkey walk at the restaurant is a must. That's the vest place to see the cheetahs. The restaurant and picnic facilities are good.",

          "Lovely picnic and braai facilities within the park.",
          "Loved it although we couldn't see any cheetahs in the cheetah camp. Loved the rhinos seeing them upclose was amazing. We all need to work on protecting our Rhinos.",

          "The place to be",
          "Beautiful well kept game park.",

          "Amazing place!!!! We loved it!!!! Animals so close to us.  And great facilities. Lovely coffe and cake too.",
          "Park is in good shape and well run. They need to update the website as gate fee is now R100 per adult. Bit like canned hunting as all game is in small area, but it was a fantastic way to spend a couple of hours. The on site cafe serves great coffee and pies.",

          "Compared to a big park like Addo you'll see more of the big 5 at closer distances but it has more of a zoo feel and the surroundings aren't as pretty, with pylons in the background etc.",
          "Absolutely incredible work that is being done here. So amazing to see a happy family of Rhinos and the new additions to the Giraffe family. Definitely worth a visit. Enjoy a cup of coffee while watching the Cheetahs roam around.",

          "Place is natural",
          "Saw most of the animals",
          "Great game park, lovely healthy and plenty animanls. Road needs a bit of attention. Quite difficult to drive.",
          "Turned around and left as soon  as we found out AT arrival  that the gates close at 5pm and you can only  use them for an extra R500 per night Unacceptable",
          "Really lovely place. We used the braai facilities and it was so clean and peaceful. While we were having lunch the warthogs were relaxing a couple of meters away. It was really nice experience. There is even a play area for the kids.",

It is on unpaved road so pls do not attempt with any car besides a 4x4 and high suspension otherwise you will cause harm to your car. Good as a day trip but don't make a special plan to visit.",

          "Good range of animals to see including Rhino, elephant, cheetah and more.",
          "Fantastic opportunity to spot most of the animals listed on the website. Route is easy enough to follow with a car but the guiding tours make it easier. Residents however do tend to exceed the 20km/h speed limit and tailgate day visitors through the site",

Plus, you get to game watch instead of drive.  Not the biggest or the best game park, but certainly a bargain if you like to see the animals up close.  ",

          "Interesting info about game /animals there sad though that shortage of water creates lot of damage",
          "Place lived up to expectations. .",
          "Awesome, I inadvertently put one star, should be 5 stars",
          "The park is Very Nice. The girafes and the rhinos are great.  Negative point is the cats \"cheetas and Lions \" are isoleted, each in their  own  place...almost like in a big cage...a little bit sad. But very well mantained overall . .",
          "I enjoyed it there",
          "Great adventure and good walk",
          "If you decide to visit the park go early 15:30 is to late .There is so much to see a hour & half is not enough overall a must ",
          "It\u2019s ok. Not much to see other then the usual suspects. I would save your bucks and head for Pilanesberg or Kruger.",
          "Great place with top class management and game. Highly recommended!",
          "This game park is a must visit! You can stay and want to stay here the whole day! \nWe will return much more! :-)",
          "Had a awesome early Mothersday outing in this  exceptional facility.",
          "Lovely for a late afternoon relaxing drive.  Lovely little shop to have a snack.  I did feel sorry for the cheetahs in their enclosure though, quite small and bushy for an animal that likes to run.",
          "A great game park for seeing the animals up close.",
          "We had such a special day with the family,little ones loved it so much .plenty of close  up photos",
          "Great value for money 2 hour game drive with a knowledgable guide - I would recommend this to everyone - especially locals"

          "A fascinating museum with something for everyone. I loved the maritime displays  and even donated a book.on the SS Mendi from the Naval Heritage trust. Well worth a visit",
          "The aquarium was closed for renovation. You still pay the full amount, which considering what we pay for other entertainment, is still cheap. The entire center cries for help.  The stars are for the trainers and the animals who still gave a good show. WE LOVED LETTIE! Pity about  of the buildings.",
          "I gave Bayworld a rating of one star due to the fact, that when we were there in 2016 it was amazing. Now when we were there in the end of 2019 it was absolutely horrendous. I mean this was really amazing place, and to see how it has been \u2026",
          "The museum part was interesting and informative, however, the snake park was outdated and cruel with different snakes and other reptiles in cramped glass enclosures. Had I known, I would not have supported them. I will not return because of the captive animals .",
          "It is really a very interesting place but it was currently undergoing renovation and parts were closed. I'm sure once the renovation is done a five star will be awarded.",
          "A bit rundown especially on the outside. It is no where near the exciting and interesting attraction it used to be. Bayworld definitely needs an urgent facelift or must close its doors permanently.",
          "Animals are very active and get to view them really close up seals are very active and very friendly to people",
          "Bayworld isn't what it used to be. The aquarium is shut down now and there are few sea life animals outside. Which is probably for the best, no animal deserves life in captivity. The information on animals reptiles and history is \u2026",
          "Went 3 times and it was closed. No notice outside my grandson was very upset",
          "Looks worn down from outside. Cant wait to see what new developments they have planned. Rest of exhibitions is very informative and love the history of PE.",
          "We had a great time.Staff were friendly and helpful.  \nI'm just disappointed that there were a chips packet and a  plastic bag in the filter of the fish tank as well as little water for the fish.",
          "Great place for kids and adults to learn about history and sea life",
          "Run down and in need of the redevelopment promised. Exhibits quite good and the live reptiles very good imo.",
          "Informayive but looks a little delapidated.needs to be refurbished. The infrastructure is aging. But its a great place with a lot of educational value",
          "Just go visit and support. Loads of very interesting exhibits and also the sea life.",
          "Very cool! Great for schools to do educational experience. Social and Natural History.",
          "Compared to 70s 80s and 90s very poor and i wonder why. Can you answer me please. Everything deteriared as the whole of SA. Disgusting",
          "The displays are good and will keep kids entertained for about an hour. The best time to go would be when the seal show starts as there is a lot of time between the seal show and snake show and the kids get very bored in between if they have seen everything.",
          "A great place to have a family outing and explore the rich history of our people and see a ton of animals",
          "The first impression of this park is 'abandoned'. I believe after the dolphins were sent they are still mourning the loss but they still have a nice seal and penguin pool which they should market. You rarely get such a close encounter with \u2026",
          "Very nice place but the aquarium was closed so we missed out on that. The tuck shop was also not open so we had to leave sooner than anticipated as the kids got thursty.",
          "A great place to take the kids for an educational visit!",
          "Very interesting although it's not taken care of.",
          "Bayworld has not been taken care of since the dolphins were transferred overseas. Why are they closed on a weekend? Isn't that when the majority of people are not working and want to take their families out to see some interesting thing's \u2026",
          "This place has so much potential.. I love the museum and snake park.. Really hope that place can be managed by professional and get's picked up",
          "The animals are kept in awful conditions. The hundreds of penguins are balding from stress, there was a turtle kept 37 years in poor and unnatural conditions which had driven itself mad, with algae all over its head and body which is very \u2026",
          "Good experience. Kids loved it. Needs a little TLC...",
          "We nearly skipped the visit after some negative reviews but were glad we went after all. The museum is very nice, with information about locals, marine life, land animals, cameras, fashion, shipwrecks and more. While there was no aquarium, \u2026",
          "Such fun for all ages. Young kids especially enjoy it. The staff are friendly  and very knowledgeable when asked displays.",
          "Except for the museum the place is rather delapitated and worn. It needs a serious redo but it doesn't seem that is going to happen soon. There are still soms penguins, seals and tortoises but that's it. The animals look well looked after though.",
          "The place was very run down.oceanarium is closed for renovations. The seal show had be canceled/cut short because to much algae in the pools. Very disappointed not worth the money you pay at the entrance",
          "Everything about it was amazing I saw different animals.",
          "Educational for small pre-school kids. Friendly staff trying hard with limited budgets and ageing infrastructure.",
          "Require some funding to do upgrades. Other wise a nice place to visit.",
          "My Family really had a good time going from exhibit to exhibit with great joy and fascination. The museum is very informative and the animal displays in the tropical house where a great hit. The aquarium is always fun and we got to se Dolly's last show afew times back in the day.",
          "Aquarium is closed, and the place looks neglected, inside displays although aged is good. Opening time is 9am but we had to wait until 10:15 before the doors opened.",
          "I just wanted Nandos & was happy to get it close-by. With plenty secured parking space. As for the meal, it was excellent. Friendly patrons too.",
          "Had a great time with learners here.",
          "Very informative. The Aquaruim was closed on the day we went due to repairs. But the other parts were still good.",
          "It is obvious that this place has seen better days. Still the people who work there seem to be trying their best to make the most of what they still have. For the price I was quite impressed with what was on display. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The ANC has properly neglected this place by withholding funding. So much for their ideas of tourism. A casino is not a tourism drawcard.\n\nI remember some 20 years ago when I took my son there to see dolphin shows. Absolute highlight of \u2026",
          "The kids enjoyed the live snake show which was free and open to the public. The environment is very neat and well maintained. They need to employ more staff to guide visitors around as the place become congested and most people were just roaming around. Overall it was good experience.",
          "Kids enjoyed it. The lack of maintenance and funds are showing.",
          "I absolutely LOVE the Night In The Museum event! What fun!",
          "Unfortunately this has been in a continuous state of decline, and with a long history which has for many, beautiful memories, the questions surrounding this decline have yet to be answered. Situated in what must be considered the most prime \u2026",
          "Awesome place for the whole family with displays of all kinds and much history to absorb. Fantastic interaction with the various animals and live snake, penguin and seal shows. Well worth a visit.",
          "Always a winner....looking fotward to renovations...a world class icon!",
          "A disgrace wont even go there if it's for free",
          "It was amacing well done",
          "My 9 year old grandson enjoyed Bayworld. It was very interesting and worth the visit. Both cloakrooms were without toilet paper in the toilets.",
          "Nice place. Run down, they trying to keep it going as much as they can. Prices is way to expensive for what you get. Still educational.",
          "Short Review: 3/5 A good way to keep kids busy for 2-3 hours in the school holidays; however showing its age. \nLong Review: Bayworld had an open tourist day where one could go in for free. Kids have been nagging for a while now to go so, \u2026",
          "Look good  kan see jou bissy to get every thing to n good standert thanks",
          "My son and I love the place",
          "Was very good. Something that our children,grand children, great grand children,,,etc can be proud of...We need this where we all came from and good educational impact.",
          "In holiday aquarium closed. Place is dirty",
          "Bay world, defnintly a very sad storu. \nThe  whole  situation heart breaking. Definitely not worth it, to pay or see. \n\nThe buildings is in poor state and not clean at all.",
          "We enjoyed going to night at the museum. The seals were dancing and having fun to the little mermaid's \"under the sea\" song. Kids were very entertained",
          "A wonderful place, not as mainstream as many but worth a visit to appreciate the natural world. In the process of refurbishment so all patronage is welcomed by a very friendly staff.",
          "Massive marine museum, some dinosaur models, live shows of penguin feeding and seal tricks",
          "Place is falling apart. Pools is dirty. Aquarium was closed. Place was stinking",
          "The aquarium is run down, they do a seal show around 11:00am which the small kids enjoy. Snake park is very neat, with some nice species. Cheap outing for parents and their youngsters.",
          "The aquarium is closed (not mentioned on the website) and the seal enclosure is very dirty. Very disappointed to take my kids there",
          "honestly it feels like they are just keeping head above water the overall feel is dated but stil a nice place to visit",
          "Things were closed and \u201cattractions\u201d scarce.  Wasn\u2019t a great experience for us or our kids.",
          "There is nothing left to see. Everything has gone downhill",
          "Good place to visit in PE, amazing and exciting things to learn from PE history, and animals!",
          "#my kids happy place!!",
          "Good place to go and no need for booking. Challenge with open times or days as most of public holidays is closed. An indoor wildlife like penguins, snakes, replica of dinosaurs, aquarium and various historical instruments and information.",
          "Beautiful place to visit for both the young and the old. Very informative too.",
          "Very dissapointed in the low maintenance",
          "This could be so fabulous but not looked after i think you can do basics like clean if you don't have money. The museum i felt was the best part. Sad there was no dolphin show.",
          "Wonder experience, Kidz loved it",
          "So sad, no water in the penguin pool, and it is soo dirty, we cannot possible say how dissapointed we are to see how backward this place has gone, Oceanarium closed, no fish tanks, so so sad",
          "Good attraction to  spend a few hours wirh family. It is however,  not much if an aquarium as there are very few tanks to view.   The museum and attached snake park thankfully extend your visit and provide more attractions. Evident that the place is in desperate need of  funding to upgrade which i sincerely hope they do.",
          "A wonderful place to visit with a variety of scenery but its exterior is in dire need of repairs.",
          "Such a lovely day outing. The snake park is great for kids. There is an interactive time where someone give a talk about the snakes then you can touch the python.",
          "Very family friendly",
          "Run down but plenty to see, it would take a few hours to see everything in the museum",
          "There too much room for improvement \ud83d\ude2a\ud83d\ude24",
          "The people are friendly an its closer to the beach",
          ".....We were impressed by this rather small Aquarium which is playing a very big part in educating it\u2019s visitors with the great danger \u201cLitter\u201d is to the Sea-Life!...Great work guys! And good luck in the future! A must visit when in Port \u2026",
          "Very educational for the school kids.  And fun",
          "To what it was before '94...no comparison. \nWay back it was immaculately maintained with dolphin shows beyond compare. \nThe service not up to scratch...waited to buy tickets with no cashier in the kiosk. \nThe fish tanks are filthy...the \u2026",
          "I love bayworld , can't wait for the upgrades",
          "Clean beautiful part of this city PE",
          "Awesome museum and animal park",
          "Every second we spent was worth it and the money spend well...what a lot of fun it was as a family to learn and experience this wonderful place.",
          "Fun for the family.",
          "What an amazing time, the kids had so much fun.",
          "The 11am seal show is awesome",
          "Educational for my grade 6 classes",
          "Absolutely left to rot. It is clear that the place has seen next to no funding in the last 25 years. In 1990 it was a shining star and a super attraction. Now, it is a shell of a place.",
          "Closed for a public holiday, especially a long Easter weekend when all holiday maker's are around.",
          "Sadly, the aquarium was closed/shut down",
          "We enjoyed the visit. The museum was informative and the seal and penguin feeding sessions very entertaining and educational. However, one has to look past the outdated appearance of the facility to enjoy the content.",
          "Very pleasant at Night at the Museum 6 - Alien Invasion.",
          "It's a lovely place to take children, for educational purposes. Or for adults who are history fans. For animal lovers, there are seals, penguins, snakes etc. Only unfortunate thing, is that it is not open on weekends.",
          "This place is a rip-off!!\nFrankly the way they look after animals they should have been shut down a long time ago!!\nHalf the aquarium displays aren't operating and the ones that are working, those animals are in a bad way, tanks haven't \u2026",
          "Really good museum with interesting displays. The seal show is well worth a see, the rescue animal are amazing and it\u2019s the closest most people will get to these incredible creatures. Research done by staff at Bayworld helps contribute to understanding the health and condition of the marine system in Algoa Bay.",
          "Extremely run down. As one of the \"go to\" places on the PE tourist map we found it a bit sad that everything is so badly maintained. The staff were friendly. But the facilities, especially the aquarium were disappointing.",
          "A great events hall",
          "Nice visit for first timers, good for kids",
          "Buildings and exhibits not well maintained",
          "I liked this place it had a nice atmosphere and the people seemed very friendly",
          "Lack of upkeep. Simple things like changing a light bulb to make an exibit interactive not done. Preaches of plastic in the ocean but their own tanks have pieces of \"frozen fish\" plastic bits and woolworths gift cards in. Pity staff only there for the paycheck...no passion for the environment",
          "The dinosaurs looks real my son wenjoyed the experience",
          "Beautiful place with friendly animals",
          "Sad seeing how it has become a shadow of its former self.",
          "Always a great place to take the kids.  Try aim for feeding times to ensure good interaction with the seals and penguins.  There are also free reptile demos once or twice a day.",
          "Worth a visit. Very good museum on a wide range of subjects. Informative seal and penguin shows. Good food at restaurant. Wheelchair friendly.",
          "The aquarium is closed and the penguin pools is very dirty",
          "Definitely going back.",
          "The Museum is more interesting than the aquariums you can definitely give more attention to life animals especially sea creatures.",
          "It looks rundown, could do with an upgrade",
          "Walking into this place it felt like a ghost town with empty tanks and green water. The penguins looked that they was well maintained. The only thing worth seeing actually is the dinosaur and reptile exhibit to be honest but definitely not worth the price. 2/5 would rather recommend going to the beach.",
          "Took kids 2 see dinosaurs & seals",
          "I've never seen such a big and beautiful mall like it it's awesome",
          "Had a seriously enjoyable day",
          "We visited the \"pop-up\" Locally Yours Market  in the aquatic information section.  I think it is a great place to have it bringing additional interest to Bayworld.",
          "This place has so much potential to be great . They are reasonably priced and have enough to keep the kids busy for a few hours",
          "Nice experience  its just needs a little  TLC",
          "Animals habitats need attention. Museum is great though",
          "Good service. Informative.",
          "Nothing going on there. Waste of money",
          "Very educational",
          "Loved every minute of it. It's a must visit",
          "It was a pity the place was close on the day",
          "Night at the museum das great for the kids",
          "Place is under improvement, may be better during peak periods",
          "It was amazing...we learnt so much and shared so many laughs...It is definitely a place to spend some family time",
          "Place is amazing",
          "Great day out for young and old..",
          "Probably past it's best days.",
          "Needs some restoration and upgrading.",
          "Only thing missing is a snack shop, would advice take tour own with if you have kids.",
          "Educational, entertaining and overall wonderful experience.",
          "This place needs upgrade",
          "Very fun and interactive shows, learned a lot\ud83d\ude0a",
          "It's fun and educational for the kids but the place is a bit run down",
          "Closed on Saturdays, how do we support it if we can never go! Do something about it please!",
          "We loved it, but only seals and penguins at the moment. Lovely snake park and especially information dense museum. Loved the local shipwreck exhibitions.",
          "Because the animals were extraordinary",
          "Not being maintained",
          "Unfortunately was closed due to labour issues as per note on the door. From the outside it look very abandoned",
          "A bit disappointed",
          "Fascinating, educational and worthwhile",
          "Big conference hall with the latest technology",
          "The great pity about Bayworld is the closure of the two main tanks.  It would be so much more enjoyable if they were still operational. The other aquatic exhibits are ok and the museum and reptile park are ok but it just seems to lack a key \u2026",
          "\ud83d\udc4d",
          "We enjoyed the museum,very informative although my son was not happy with the \"evolution of man\". The seals were great entertainment.The place could do with some renovations though..",
          "Love how Bayworld has changed their focus from using animals to entertain humans to educating humans on the conservation of these animals",
          "Sadly the place isn't looked after, its dirty... Not even the fact that it's cheap makes it worth going.",
          "Love it, great experience with kids.",
          "Very informative and interactive for the kids",
          "Best for children. A lot to learn. Handshakes even kisses from lucky the seal . Friendly staff.",
          "leka vibes here nice n chilled good samoosa der n slushys",
          "My kid gives this place 4 stars. I give it 2 stars. I'm glad they don't have captive dolphins, sharks etc. But it is a bit run down. They say they need money but dusting off displays doesn't need funding or a tender. Rescued seal show is fun. Reptiles and museum were a hit. Money wasn't wasted IMHO",
          "Nice day out. but is had better days .",
          "Better for affotdable accomodation in P.E",
          "Good for outdoor activities. Watching animals do plays.. show times available on the website",
          "The museum is very interesting. It is just bad tht thei dont have the dolphins any more.",
          "PE, Bayworld needs your attention, it is slowly deteriorating!",
          "Great distraction",
          "Very good museum. Poorly maintained and standard dropping. Very disappointing.",
          "Very friendly workers they love their job",
          "Love the interactions. Very informative",
          "It wars worth a visit! I liked the animal encounter @12 when we could hold a live snake! There is potential for improvement, but if you are in PE you should consider a visit!",
          "I always wanted to see dolphins. you have a pool for them. Please bring them back!!!!!!",
          "Terrible. Don't waste money going to see nothing. Such a great place that now offers nothing.",
          "Museum was good. Not huge, but full of local history. Aquarium was neat and clean. Feeding time is 11:00AM so best to arrive just before then. there's also a seal show.",
          "We drove an hour and 40 minutes to go to Bayworld. And when we arrived it was closed due to a staff function, yet nothing was posted on the website saying that it would be closed! What a waste of a trip! These things should be posted on the website, that's why the website is there. I am very disappointed with the service.",
          "Try to catch Dolphins show @ 15:00. Wow we were blown away. Place looks all dusty outside, needs a make over. But we had incredible time - museum.",
          "Great place to witness history and be part of it too",
          "Nice place for history on some animals, pinguins did not want to get into their pool, just wanted to be fed\n\ud83d\ude04. Upgrade will do.",
          "Was pleasantly surprised! Although the main attraction has been gone for some time. It really was fun to visit. And very educational! Good for school trips. The infrastructure is a bit neglected and needs a bit of TLC. ",
          "Very sad to see how little remains of Bayworld but gr8 to see how wonderful the staff that work with the seals are.",
          "Been there many times and always worth revisiting. Good family outing.",
          "It's never open",
          "We like going there.",
          "Very nice and educational for the children",
          "Super fun day for the Family and kiddies! The reptile section is superb with lots of different types! However the marine aquarium section is underwhelming with not much to look at.",
          "Always interesting for a insightful look at Eastern Cape history. Displays are a bit dated. Staff are passionate about looking after the environment and it's animals.",
          "Awesome lecture. Great lecture facilities",
          "A bit under budget, the staff try their best to do with what they have",
          "Loved it. Loads to learn about the local history. Place is being neglected though, up keep and maintenance needs improvement. Was safe and secure. Staff were friendly.",
          "The museum and snake park was ok but the Bayworld was neglected and not as I remember it the previous time.",
          "Can do with some upgrades and renovations. Also staff can definitely be a lot friendlier.",
          "Always one of my favorite places",
          "I like your shows.",
          "No upgrades for a long time",
          "Sad about the dolphins- was there 10 years ago and it was the best feature. Seals were entertaining and snake interaction was very scary but interesting.",

          "The place looks sad and abandoned,it used to be alive and beatiful back in the 90s...2000s. It needs serious attention, and I am not even talking about the empty dolphin pools yet. :'(. The snakes are still awesome to watch,crocs made me uncomfortable.....they look like a disaster waiting to happen,I hope they are well fed",

Port Elizabeth is a tourism gateway city for big five game viewing, South Africa's national's arts festival, outdoor recreation, adventure tourism and numerous nature conservancies, including the Baviaanskloof mega-reserve, Port Elizabeth was one of the host cities for the official tournament of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-History ===\nCave sites not far from Port Elizabeth, such as Albany, Wilton and Howiesons Poort, have given their names to various archaeological cultures. The Howiesons Poort has been of particular interest to interpretations about the origins of fully modern human behaviour. Dating to 65 000 to 62 000 years ago, it has yielded extremely old evidence for bow and arrow hunting and shell-bead jewellery. Earlier and Middle Stone Age lithic material has been found in the Sundays River Valley, while at the important site of Amanzi Springs, 40 km north of the Port Elizabeth near Addo, Earlier Stone Age artefacts are found in situ with well-preserved plant and faunal remains within spring sediments (Deacon, 1970). There is Later Stone Age archaeological material preserved in caves and rock shelters, such as Melkhoutboom Cave, in the Cape Fold Belt Mountain surrounding Port Elizabeth (see Deacon and Deacon, 1963; Deacon, 1976; Binneman, 1997) and large numbers of coastal shell middens have been reported at Humewood, St. George's Strand and the Coega River Mouth (Rudner, 1968). Most recently, Binneman and Webley (1997) reported thirteen shell middens and stone tool scatters about 500 m east of the Coega River mouth in the archaeological assessment carried out for the development of maritime infrastructure for the Port of Ngqura. Importantly, some of this archaeological material was recorded in secondary context in the gravels from older river terraces along the banks of the Coega River.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nIn 1820, the rising seaport of Algoa Bay was named  \"Port Elizabeth\" in memory of Elizabeth Frances n\u00e9e Markham, the late wife of Rufane Shaw Donkin, acting Governor of the Cape Colony.  In 2019, the Eastern Cape Geographical Names Committee (ECGNC) announced the city of Port Elizabeth is likely to have its name changed to Gqeberha, a Xhosa word used to refer to the Baakens River that flows through the city.\n\n\n=== Early History ===\nHunters and gatherers ancestral to the San first settled the area around what is now called Algoa Bay at least 10,000 years ago. Around 2,000 years ago, they were gradually displaced or assimilated by agriculturalist populations ancestral to the Xhosa people, who migrated into the region from the north.\n\n\n=== British Settlement ===\nThe first Europeans to visit the area sailed with the Portuguese explorers Bartholomeu Dias, who landed on St Croix Island in Algoa Bay in 1488, and Vasco da Gama, who noted the nearby Bird Island in 1497. For centuries, the area appeared on European navigation charts marked simply as \"a landing place with fresh water\".The Portuguese Crown had as one of its main goals in the Indian Ocean taking over the lucrative trade of Arab and Afro-Arabian merchants who plied routes between the East African coast and India. As they took over that trade in Africa, the Portuguese strengthened trading with Goa, their main trading point in India. The name Algoa means \"to Goa\", just as the port further north in present-day Mozambique, Delagoa means \"from Goa\" in Portuguese.The area became part of the Cape Colony. This area had a turbulent history between the settlement by the Dutch East India Company in 1652 and the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910.\n\nIn 1799, at the time of the first British occupation of the Colony during the Napoleonic Wars, British troops built a stone fort named Fort Frederick after the Duke of York. This fort, aiming to deter a possible landing of French troops, was constructed to oversee the site of what later became Port Elizabeth. The fort is now preserved as a monument.From 1814 to 1821 the Strandfontein farm was owned by Piet Retief. He later became a Voortrekker leader and was killed in 1837 by Zulu king Dingane during negotiations about land. An estimated 500 men, woman and children of his party were massacred. Frederik Korsten owned the Strandfontein farm after Retief. The suburb of Korsten was named after Frederick in the 19th century. This area was later developed as the Summerstrand beach suburb of Port Elizabeth.In 1820 a party of 4,000 British settlers arrived by sea, encouraged by the government of the Cape Colony to form a settlement to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa people. At this time the seaport town was founded by Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin, the Acting Governor of the Cape Colony (in office: 1820-1821). \nDiplomat Edmund Roberts visited Port Elizabeth in the early 1830s. Roberts noted that Port Elizabeth in the 1820s had \"contained four houses, and now it has upward of one hundred houses, and its residents are rated at above twelve hundred persons\".The Roman Catholic Church established the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope, Eastern District in the city in 1847. Port Elizabeth was granted the status of autonomous municipality in 1861. \nCape Colony Prime Minister John Molteno had formed the Cape Government Railways in 1872. Completion of the railway to Kimberley in 1873 was a major stimulus to trade and a rapid increase in population in the town. With the massive expansion of the Cape Colony's railway network to the interior over the following years, the harbour of Port Elizabeth became the focus for serving import and export needs of a large area of the Cape's hinterland. The rapid economic development around the port, which followed the railway construction, caused Port Elizabeth to be nicknamed \"the Liverpool of South Africa\", after a major British port. The town expanded as a diverse community, comprising Xhosa as well as European, Cape Malay, and other immigrants.\n\nDuring the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902, the port served as an important transit-point for British soldiers, horses, and materials headed by railway to the front. No armed conflict took place within the city, but it felt the effects of the war with the arrival of many refugees who moved into the city. These included Boer women and children, whom the British interned in a concentration camp. \nAfter the war, the British erected a monument to military horses that died during the war. \"The unveiling of the monument commemorating the services of the horses which perished during the Anglo Boer War, 1899-1902, took place on Saturday afternoon, February 11, 1905, with His Worship the Mayor, Mr A Fettes, performing the ceremony.\"\n\n\n=== Apartheid era ===\nUnder apartheid, the South African government established legal racial segregation and started programs to separate communities physically as well as by classification and custom. The forced relocation under the auspices of the Group Areas Act of the non-white population from mixed areas began in 1962, causing various townships to be built for their use. Classification was sometimes arbitrary, and as in many other localities throughout the country, many citizens appearing to have mixed ancestry were at times subject to re-classification, which often had intrusive sociopolitical results. The non-white tenants of South End, and land owners in Fairview were forcibly relocated from 1965 through to 1975, as these areas were valued as prime real estate. The city-planning was viewed as the prototypical apartheid city.\nAs black South Africans organized to try to achieve civil rights and social justice, government repression increased. In 1977 Steve Biko, the black anti-apartheid activist, was interrogated and tortured by the security police in Port Elizabeth before being transported to Pretoria, where he died. Other notable deaths in the city during this time included those of The Cradock Four, and of George Botha, a high-school teacher.\n\n\n==== 1952 Defiance Campaign ====\nIn 1952 the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress (SAIC) called all South Africans to stand up against the apartheid government's unjust laws directed at the black African, Indian and coloured population. On April 6, while most white South Africans celebrated the tercentenary of Jan van Riebeeck's arrival at the Cape in 1652, the ANC and SAIC called on black South Africans to observe the day as a \"A National Day of Pledge and Prayer\". 15 000 people attended in Johannesburg, 10 000 in Cape Town, 10 000 in Durban and 20 000 in Port Elizabeth. The meeting in Port Elizabeth was led by Professor Z. K. Matthews and by Raymond Mhlaba.\nOn 25 July 1952, a day before the official start of the Defiance Campaign, 30 volunteers led by Raymond Mhlaba gathered at the New Brighton Civic Centre and prayed throughout the night. At 5am on 26 July, they left the Civic Centre and walked towards the New Brighton Railway Station. In Raymond Mhlaba's Personal Memoirs: Reminiscing from Rwanda and Uganda, Mhlaba recalled:\n\n\"I led the very first group and we entered the 'Europeans Only' section of the New Brighton station. By half past six we were already in police vans on our way to jail. It turned out that my party (group) was the very first to defy unjust laws in the whole of South Africa. Little did we know that we were making history.\"\n\nMhlaba became the first man to be arrested during the campaign, while Florence Matomela was the first woman. 2 007 people were arrested in Port Elizabeth during the Defiance Campaign included Oom Gov (Govan Mbeki) and Vuyisile Mini. Other volunteers who emerged as key role players during the campaign included Nosipho Dastile, Nontuthuzelo Mabala, Lilian Diedricks and Veronica Sobukwe.\n\n\n==== 1985 Consumer Boycotts ====\nAfter the formation of the ANC-affiliated United Democratic Front in 1983, political consciousness in black townships grew. With numerous protests across the country and the massacre in Langa township near Uitenhage, Eastern Cape police presence had increased in South African townships. In Port Elizabeth townships, black South Africans demanded the integration of public institutions, the removal of troops from black townships, and the end of workplace discrimination. To launch an effective campaign to cripple the white-owned institutions of Port Elizabeth and to undermine the legitimacy of apartheid, several women suggested the idea of a consumer boycott to the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO) in May 1985. The economic boycott began on July 15, 1985, and received massive support in townships around Port Elizabeth. By September 1985, white business-owners became desperate and called on the government to meet the demands of black South Africans. In November the boycott was still hurting white businesses in Port Elizabeth greatly. The white South African government reached an agreement with PEBCO which stated that the boycott would halt until March 1986 if business owners arranged for the release of black leaders.In 1986, as the deal was approaching its end, the boycotters imposed a deadline of March 31, stating that the boycott would resume if the initial demands were not met. On March 11, the government unexpectedly banned two leaders, one of whom was Mkuseli Jack. However, on March 22, the ban was lifted by the decision of a Supreme Court Justice on the grounds that the government had given insufficient reasons. Jack ripped up the ban papers, and used the celebration as a way to represent the solidarity that the campaign required. As the demands of the boycotters were not met by March 31, the boycott was renewed on April 1. The boycott continued for nine weeks, but on June 12, 1986, another state of emergency was imposed by the National Party government. Security forces searched through the townships, arresting thousands and raiding the offices of black civics, trade unions, the UDF, the South African Council, and churches and also confiscating documents.\n\n\n=== Modern History ===\nWith the establishment of the  Coega Industrial Development Zone (CIDZ), foreign direct and also national-level investment has improved substantially in the region of Nelson Mandela Bay/Port Elizabeth. The IDZ, under the stewardship of the Coega Development Corporation (CDC), since inception has managed to attract to its investment account in excess of R140-billion into the economy of the Eastern Cape and has enabled the creation of over 45 000 jobs. This is significant for the sustainability of the IDZ, Nelson Mandela Bay, and the economy of the Eastern Cape. The CDC consistently continues to demonstrate its capability as the leading catalyst for socio-economic growth in the Eastern Cape, with a view to becoming so for South Africa.\nIn 2001 the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality was formed as an administrative area covering Port Elizabeth, the neighbouring towns of Uitenhage and Despatch and the surrounding agricultural areas. The name honours former President Nelson Mandela. The combined metropolitan area had a population estimated at around 1.3 million in 2006.\n\n\n==== 2010 FIFA World Cup ====\nOvertaking its next door neighbouring city East London, Port Elizabeth became the host city for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium hosted eight World Cup games were South Korea vs Greece, Ivory Coast vs Portugal, Germany vs Serbia; Chile vs Switzerland, Slovenia vs England in the Group Stage, then Uruguay, South Korea in the Round of 16. A quarter-final between Netherlands, Brazil was hosted, then for the Third Place playoff, Uruguay, Germany were hosted at the stadium. The World Cup was played between 11 June 2010 and 11 July 2010. Spain were the eventual champions.\n\n\n==== 2013 Africa Cup of Nations ====\nPort Elizabeth was also one of the five cities that hosted the 2013 Afcon event. Same stadium of 2010 World Cup hosted eight games: five matches of Group B included Ghana, DR Congo; Mali, Niger; Ghana, Mali; DR. Congo, Niger; Ghana, Niger; one match of Group A Cape Verde, Angola. Quarterfinal Ghana, Cape Verde, then Third Place playoff Ghana, Mali. The Africa Cup of Nations took place between 19 January and 10 February 2013. Nigeria were eventual champions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Port Elizabeth has an oceanic climate (Cfb\u202f). The area lies between the winter rainfall, Mediterranean climate zones of the Western Cape and the summer rainfall regions of eastern South Africa. Winters are cool but mild and summers are warm but considerably less humid and hot than more northerly parts of South Africa's east coast. The climate is very even throughout the year with extreme heat or moderate cold rare.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nPort Elizabeth represents a large percentage of South Africa's biological diversity and the city is a confluence point five of the seven South African biomes, namely the Thicket, Grassland, Nama-Karoo, Fynbos and Forest Biomes. A number of municipal nature reserves have been included in, and can be visited along the \u201cOutward Bound Route\u201d of the city. A mosaic of these 5 Biomes could be experienced in these reserves. The outward bound route is an eco-outdoor adventure and sports route incorporating walking and wildlife experiences. The aim of this route is to spread tourism to similar attractions along the route, leading to increased foot traffic and related benefits to these sites.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nAs a British colonial town, the city had a strongly British character, and the central area retains that to this day. Few of the buildings featured in this tour would be out of place in an English market town.  The colonial City Hall is a national monument. The Port Elizabeth main public library is an excellent example of Victorian Gothic architecture. Various memorials are situated throughout the city environs, and there are many tours available to familiarise visitors with especially the apartheid era. Port Elizabeth could be considered to be the country's leading centre of Art Nouveau style architecture due to its European heritage. Many buildings display the intricate stonework, wrought iron and stained glass of that era which are prominently visible in the Central Historical areas of the city. Combinations of Art Nouveau and Colonial styles are seen in residences along Cape Road.The area also boasts a collection of Cape Dutch style architecture as well as the Victorian and Edwardian styles, resulting from the arrival of the 1820 British settlers. Although influenced by Dutch architecture, the Cape Dutch style is unique to South Africa and examples can be seen all over the Eastern and Western Cape. \n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\nPort Elizabeth has numerous water features in its encompassing area.  There is a vast length of marine coastline on the city's outer encroachments particularly southwards. Beaches like Kings Beach, Hobie Beach, Bluewater Bay, Sardinia Bay, and the beaches along Marine Drive are abundant. Kings Beach is adjacent to Port Elizabeth's harbour, and the longshore drift from Cape Recife provides a plentiful supply of sea sand. On the north westerly coastline of Port Elizabeth, the contours tends to be rockier than the area between Cape Recife, and the Port of Ngqura. Port Elizabeth has a few rivers, of which the Baakens River is the most prominent. This river usually floods when a reasonable amount precipitation is observed, especially at low level crossings. North End Lake is the largest natural freshwater body in Port Elizabeth, but has experienced a form of contamination from industry. (It is not recommended to ingest anything from this lake) Also, numerous smaller \"lakes\" are in the surrounding area, namely Lake Farm.  Port Elizabeth (as a whole, the entire Eastern Cape) is experiencing a devastating drought, of which a disaster has been declared by the current office bearers of the greater municipality. Water restrictions are in place, and measures are in place to provide enough water in the near future, namely freshwater treatment works being constructed to acquire additional water from the Gariep Dam.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPort Elizabeth is the most populous city in the Eastern Cape. In 2001:\nArea: 335.3 square kilometres (129.5 sq mi)\nPopulation: 237,502: 708.32 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,834.5/sq mi)\nHouseholds: 70,606: 210.58 per square kilometre (545.4/sq mi)\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Trade and industry ===\nThe largest economic sectors in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro are manufacturing, finance, community services and transport. Community services, trade and manufacturing sectors are the sectors that create the most employment in the Metro. The city offers a wealth of tourism and recreation opportunity due to its biodiversity, beaches and open spaces.  Further still, Nelson Mandela Bay is a preferred region for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, flour, meat, frozen veggies, soft drinks, chocolates, cheese, yoghurt, ice-cream, paper and leather products.Historically, the majority of trade in the region came through Port Elizabeth. In the 1830s, at least five ships regularly transported goods to Europe. It became a free port in 1832. In 1833, about 50 vessels had moved through the port. In 1828, 55,201 pounds, (25038 kg), of goods were imported through the port, increasing by 1832 to 112,845 pounds, (51185 kg), imported in that year. Port Elizabeth exported 41,290 pounds, (18738 kg), in 1828, with a large increase to 86,931 pounds, (39431 kg), goods exported in 1829. Exports included wine, brandy, vinegar, ivory, hides and skins, leather, tallow, butter, soap, wool, ostrich feathers, salted beef, wheat, candles, aloe, barley, and more.Home of South Africa's motor vehicle industry, Port Elizabeth boasts most vehicle assembly plants, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Continental Tyres and many other automotive-related companies. As of 2018, after GM's exit from Port Elizabeth and South Africa, Isuzu took over their production plant in Struandale. In 2016, Chinese state-owned automotive manufacturer BAIC and South Africa's Industrial Development Corporation announced a R11 billion joint venture for the establishment of a semi knock down vehicle assembly plant in Coega.  It is anticipated that the plant will go online in 2020.  The FAW also have built a multi-billion rand plant in the region. Most other industries in Port Elizabeth are geared towards the motor vehicle industry, providing parts such as wiring harnesses, catalytic converters, batteries and tyres to the vehicle manufacturers.\nPort Elizabeth is also a major seaport, with the most significant car loading facilities in the southern hemisphere. As part of the ongoing development, a new Industrial Development Zone with expanded port facilities has been built at Coega.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nLocated at the end of the picturesque Garden Route along the Cape coast, the city has beaches in and near it. The most popular swimming beaches include King's Beach and Hobie Beach.\nMany local historic attractions are linked by the Donkin Heritage Trail. These include the Campanile (bell tower), built in 1923 to commemorate the arrival of the 1820 Settlers and offering a viewpoint over the city; the city hall (1862); the Donkin Reserve park and monument; and the old stone Fort Frederick itself (1799). The CBD also boasts the towering Eastern Cape post office headquarters.\nRoute 67 is a walking trail consisting of 67 public artworks, symbolising 67 years which Nelson Mandela dedicated to the freedom of South Africa. The artwork is a celebration of South African culture and history and is scattered along the route as it starts from the Campanile, up the stairs to the Vuysile Mini Market Square and to the large South African flag at the Donkin Reserve. The artworks were created by local Eastern Cape artists.Other attractions include the gardens at St George's Park, the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum (formerly known as the King George VI Art Gallery), the museum and oceanography room at Humewood, and the new Boardwalk waterfront complex.\nThe wider area surrounding PE also features game viewing opportunities, including the Addo Elephant National Park, 72 kilometres (45 mi) to the north near the Zuurberg mountain range.\nPort Elizabeth is also a destination for whale watching with humpback whales sighted between June and August, and again between November and January, southern right whales sighted between July and November, and Bryde's whales sighted all year round.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe biggest sporting events in Port Elizabeth, is the annual Ironman triathlon and the Herald Cycle tour. The Tuna classic deep-sea fishing competition attracts anglers from all over the world.\nThe city has facilities catering for cricket, rugby union, athletics, association football, field hockey and many other sports. Its coastal location also makes it a base for many watersports.\nPort Elizabeth is the location of the St George's Park cricket ground, which holds test cricket matches. St George's Park is the oldest cricket ground in South Africa, and was the venue for the first Test match played outside of Australia or England, between South Africa and England on 12 and 13 March 1889. The Warriors, a franchise cricket team in South Africa, is based in Port Elizabeth. The stadium is also known for its band that entertains fans at the Proteas games.\nThe headquarters of the Southern Spears rugby franchise was in Port Elizabeth. The long-standing Eastern Province Rugby Union, now commonly known as the Eastern Province Elephants, formed the basis of the Spears franchise together with East London's Border Bulldogs. The remnants of the Spears were later reconstituted into the Southern Kings, also based in Port Elizabeth, which joined Super Rugby in 2013. The Southern Kings did not participate in Super Rugby in 2014 or 2015, and returned to Super Rugby in 2016, 2017, but were dropped for economical reasons by SARU. The team now competes in the Guinness Pro14. The Eastern Province Rugby Union play their home matches at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, built for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn December 2011, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium became the new home of the South Africa Sevens, the country's leg of the annual IRB Sevens World Series in rugby sevens. The event had previously been held in three other cities, most recently in George in the Western Cape from 2002 to 2010. As of 2015, is hosted annually in Cape Town, in the Western Cape.\nThe city's main football club is Chippa United, they currently use the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium as their home ground. Previous clubs to play in the country's top tier were Bay United, Michau Warriors, Port Elizabeth Blackpool, Hotspur F.C., Port Elizabeth City and Westview Apollon.\nThe Algoa Bay Yacht Club operates out of the Port of Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n== Government ==\nPort Elizabeth had its own municipality from 1843 to 2000.  Since then, it has formed part of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, and serves as the seat for the surrounding Cacadu District Municipality. It has a Magistrate's Court, a local seat of the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court, and a branch of the Labour Court. As a result of the presence of a High Court, several other related organs of state such as a Masters Office and a Director of Public Prosecutions are present in the city.\nAll Government (mostly provincial) departments maintain branches or other offices in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe Port Elizabeth municipality assumed a coat of arms on 9 January 1878.  The design, prepared by Bradbury Wilkinson and Company (of London), was a simplified version of the arms of Sir Rufane Donkin : Gules,  on a chevron Argent between two cinquefoils in chief and a bugle horn stringed in base Or, three buckles Sable;  a chief embattled Argent thereon an elephant statant proper.  The crest was a sailing ship, and the motto In meliora spera.\n(In layman's terms : a red shield displaying, from top to bottom, an elephant on a silver horizontal strip whose lower edge is embattled, two gold cinquefoils, a silver chevron bearing three black buckles, and a gold bugle horn.)\nEighty years later, in 1958, the council made slight changes to the arms, and had them granted by the College of Arms.  The changes consisted of adding two anchors to the chief of the shield, placing a red mural crown bearing three golden rings below the ship in the crest, and changing the motto to Tu meliora spera.  The arms were registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in 1959, and at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1986.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University Level ===\nThe Nelson Mandela University was formed by the amalgamation of the University of Port Elizabeth, Port Elizabeth Technikon, and the Port Elizabeth campus of Vista University. It is the largest university in the Eastern and Southern Cape, with around 29,000 students in seven faculties spread over seven campuses.\nRussell Road College and AFDA also have campuses in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== High School Level ===\nThe city has a number of top government-funded and private schools, although the abuse of substances seems to prevail in some schools due to a lack of drug prevention training on the part of the educational system, including Alexander Road High School, Collegiate Girls' High School, Victoria Park High School, Grey High School, Pearson High School, Woodridge College, Andrew Rabie High School and Lawson Brown High School.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nPort Elizabeth lies on the N2 road. To the west the road travels the Garden Route to George and Cape Town; to the east, the road runs through the Border Country through Makhanda, to East London then on to Durban, terminating in Ermelo in Mpumalanga. The R75 connects Port Elizabeth to the Karoo. The major routes within the city are numbered as metropolitan or M routes.\nThe city's main bus station is in Market Square. The public bus service is run by the Algoa Bus Company.  Between 1881 and 1948, there was a Port Elizabeth tramway network, powered initially by horses, and later by electricity.\nThe city is in the process of building a bus rapid transit system which was intended for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This has been a massive failure as local taxi associations have prevented the implementation. Port Elizabeth lacks a proper public transport system which has had a negative impact on the poorer residents of the city who are dependent on public transport. Construction of the bus rapid transit network has been suspended due to mismanagement which led to the project missing its May 2010 deadline. Calls for the project, which has left many parts of the city in a permanent state of construction, have been made recently, and it is expected that the government will make a decision on the matter soon.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nPort Elizabeth railway station is served by South Africa's rail network. Local commuter services are operated by Metrorail, while the Shosholoza Meyl long-distance passenger service links PE with Johannesburg via Bloemfontein where it is possible to connect with other long-distance routes.The Apple Express narrow-gauge tourist train to Avontuur operated from the separate station in Humewood Road near King's Beach. It departed regularly for Thornhill Village via Van Stadens River bridge, the highest narrow-gauge rail bridge in the world. The Apple Express was launched to provide a service to transport fresh produce and wood from the farms along the line to Avontuur. The line was completed in 1914 and the train delivered produce directly from the farms to ships in the Port Elizabeth Harbour. Due to modern transport methods such as containerisation, and refrigerated containers and trucks, the Apple Express and its services became redundant. Service has now ceased.\nIn preparation for the 2010 World Cup Soccer event the Humerail Station was extensively upgraded. Several disused narrow gauge goods wagons were scrapped and removed from the site, several buildings in the area have also been renovated and revamped.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nPort Elizabeth Airport (IATA airport code PLZ, ICAO airport code FAPE) serves the city for both passenger and cargo traffic. It is the fourth busiest airport in South Africa after O.R. Tambo International Airport, King Shaka International Airport in Durban, and Cape Town International Airport.\nInternational visitors to the city must currently fly to either Johannesburg, Cape Town or Durban, and then take a domestic flight to Port Elizabeth. An upgrade to the terminal building, completed in 2004, created the necessary facilities to handle international flights although none are scheduled as yet.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nPort Elizabeth has a harbour in Algoa Bay, and the construction of an additional international harbour at Coega has supported an increase in the size of the city's industries and the addition of new industries.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city has government-funded and private hospitals, including:\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nPort Elizabeth is served by a few radio outlets, namely Algoa FM, Umhlobo Wenene FM (radio broadcasting to the residents of Port Elizabeth, as well as the entire Eastern Cape, and Garden Route, and globally, online.)\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nThe Herald serves the English populace in terms of newspaper, on a daily basis. Die Burger serves the Afrikaans communities as well with a well established readership base.\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nThere are various social media news groups in Port Elizabeth, which is used at most as neighbourhood watch groups.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe SABC has a regional office in Port Elizabeth.  Bay TV is a free-to-air station established by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality that broadcasts 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. The station focusses on African story-telling and creating platforms for local content creators, and receives funding from local government and corporate donors.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n Beira, Mozambique\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nRed Location Museum\nList of heritage sites in Port Elizabeth\nFort Frederick, Eastern Cape\nBloemendal\nNational Monument\nVictorian era\nDonkin Heritage Trail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPort Elizabeth of Yore: The Defiance Campaign of 1952",

        "wiki": "Port Elizabeth or Nelson Mandela Bay (Xhosa: iBhayi, alternatively Gqebera; Afrikaans: Die Baai [di \u02c8b\u0251\u02d0i]) often known by its initials PE, and colloquially as \u201cThe Friendly City\u201dor \"The Windy City\", is a major seaport city and most populous city in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.  Port Elizabeth is the seat of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa's second largest metropolitan district by area.  It is the most-populous city of the Eastern Cape and the sixth most-populous city in South Africa. the most-populous city of Eastern Cape; and the cultural, economic and financial center of the Eastern Cape.  The city is among the top five cities in the world for pleasant weather, according to a 2014 scientific climate study of 600 global cities.  Port Elizabeth is known for many blue-flag beaches along the city's urban coastline; its popularity as an international and local holiday destination; and its rich and diverse cultural heritage.  It is a tourism gateway city for the Eastern Cape and the only city with the closest proximity to malaria-free big five game reserves.The economy of Port Elizabeth is primarily oriented towards automotive assembly, manufacturing and export industries, and the city is also a major South African and sub-Saharan African destination for investment. Foreign direct investments of $19,8 billion has been secured over the past decade. Several Fortune 500 companies have a presence or their African operations headquartered in Port Elizabeth. The city's most prominent landmarks are Shark Rock pier, the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, and the Donkin Reserve.\nPort Elizabeth is a popular domestic and international holiday destination.  It is a gateway city for Eastern Cape's adventure, outdoor and African big five game, malaria-free safari tourism.Port Elizabeth is located in the south eastern coast of South Africa.  It is situated on the western portion of Algoa Bay, adjacent to the Indian Ocean.  The city lies 770 km east of Cape Town, between South Africa's Garden Route and Wild Coast.  Port Elizabeth covers 251 square kilometers of the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area, South Africa's sixth largest metropolitan municipality. Fortune 500 companies are present or have their African operations headquartered in the city.  Port Elizabeth is the second oldest city in South Africa.  It was founded in 1820 by the government of the Cape Colony when 4,000 British colonists settled Algoa Bay to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa. The city's moderate subtropical climate ranks among the top ten cities in the world for highly pleasant, all year round weather, according to a Syracuse University climatology study.Port Elizabeth is a popular tourist holiday destination. Shark Rock Pier, a prominent installation on the shoreline of Port Elizabeth's Summerstrand precinct, is the city's most famous landmark.  Port Elizabeth is a tourism gateway city for big five game viewing, South Africa's national's arts festival, outdoor recreation, adventure tourism and numerous nature conservancies, including the Baviaanskloof mega-reserve, Port Elizabeth was one of the host cities for the official tournament of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-History ===\nCave sites not far from Port Elizabeth, such as Albany, Wilton and Howiesons Poort, have given their names to various archaeological cultures. The Howiesons Poort has been of particular interest to interpretations about the origins of fully modern human behaviour. Dating to 65 000 to 62 000 years ago, it has yielded extremely old evidence for bow and arrow hunting and shell-bead jewellery. Earlier and Middle Stone Age lithic material has been found in the Sundays River Valley, while at the important site of Amanzi Springs, 40 km north of the Port Elizabeth near Addo, Earlier Stone Age artefacts are found in situ with well-preserved plant and faunal remains within spring sediments (Deacon, 1970). There is Later Stone Age archaeological material preserved in caves and rock shelters, such as Melkhoutboom Cave, in the Cape Fold Belt Mountain surrounding Port Elizabeth (see Deacon and Deacon, 1963; Deacon, 1976; Binneman, 1997) and large numbers of coastal shell middens have been reported at Humewood, St. George's Strand and the Coega River Mouth (Rudner, 1968). Most recently, Binneman and Webley (1997) reported thirteen shell middens and stone tool scatters about 500 m east of the Coega River mouth in the archaeological assessment carried out for the development of maritime infrastructure for the Port of Ngqura. Importantly, some of this archaeological material was recorded in secondary context in the gravels from older river terraces along the banks of the Coega River.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nIn 1820, the rising seaport of Algoa Bay was named  \"Port Elizabeth\" in memory of Elizabeth Frances n\u00e9e Markham, the late wife of Rufane Shaw Donkin, acting Governor of the Cape Colony.  In 2019, the Eastern Cape Geographical Names Committee (ECGNC) announced the city of Port Elizabeth is likely to have its name changed to Gqeberha, a Xhosa word used to refer to the Baakens River that flows through the city.\n\n\n=== Early History ===\nHunters and gatherers ancestral to the San first settled the area around what is now called Algoa Bay at least 10,000 years ago. Around 2,000 years ago, they were gradually displaced or assimilated by agriculturalist populations ancestral to the Xhosa people, who migrated into the region from the north.\n\n\n=== British Settlement ===\nThe first Europeans to visit the area sailed with the Portuguese explorers Bartholomeu Dias, who landed on St Croix Island in Algoa Bay in 1488, and Vasco da Gama, who noted the nearby Bird Island in 1497. For centuries, the area appeared on European navigation charts marked simply as \"a landing place with fresh water\".The Portuguese Crown had as one of its main goals in the Indian Ocean taking over the lucrative trade of Arab and Afro-Arabian merchants who plied routes between the East African coast and India. As they took over that trade in Africa, the Portuguese strengthened trading with Goa, their main trading point in India. The name Algoa means \"to Goa\", just as the port further north in present-day Mozambique, Delagoa means \"from Goa\" in Portuguese.The area became part of the Cape Colony. This area had a turbulent history between the settlement by the Dutch East India Company in 1652 and the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910.\n\nIn 1799, at the time of the first British occupation of the Colony during the Napoleonic Wars, British troops built a stone fort named Fort Frederick after the Duke of York. This fort, aiming to deter a possible landing of French troops, was constructed to oversee the site of what later became Port Elizabeth. The fort is now preserved as a monument.From 1814 to 1821 the Strandfontein farm was owned by Piet Retief. He later became a Voortrekker leader and was killed in 1837 by Zulu king Dingane during negotiations about land. An estimated 500 men, woman and children of his party were massacred. Frederik Korsten owned the Strandfontein farm after Retief. The suburb of Korsten was named after Frederick in the 19th century. This area was later developed as the Summerstrand beach suburb of Port Elizabeth.In 1820 a party of 4,000 British settlers arrived by sea, encouraged by the government of the Cape Colony to form a settlement to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa people. At this time the seaport town was founded by Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin, the Acting Governor of the Cape Colony (in office: 1820-1821). \nDiplomat Edmund Roberts visited Port Elizabeth in the early 1830s. Roberts noted that Port Elizabeth in the 1820s had \"contained four houses, and now it has upward of one hundred houses, and its residents are rated at above twelve hundred persons\".The Roman Catholic Church established the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope, Eastern District in the city in 1847. Port Elizabeth was granted the status of autonomous municipality in 1861. \nCape Colony Prime Minister John Molteno had formed the Cape Government Railways in 1872. Completion of the railway to Kimberley in 1873 was a major stimulus to trade and a rapid increase in population in the town. With the massive expansion of the Cape Colony's railway network to the interior over the following years, the harbour of Port Elizabeth became the focus for serving import and export needs of a large area of the Cape's hinterland. The rapid economic development around the port, which followed the railway construction, caused Port Elizabeth to be nicknamed \"the Liverpool of South Africa\", after a major British port. The town expanded as a diverse community, comprising Xhosa as well as European, Cape Malay, and other immigrants.\n\nDuring the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902, the port served as an important transit-point for British soldiers, horses, and materials headed by railway to the front. No armed conflict took place within the city, but it felt the effects of the war with the arrival of many refugees who moved into the city. These included Boer women and children, whom the British interned in a concentration camp. \nAfter the war, the British erected a monument to military horses that died during the war. \"The unveiling of the monument commemorating the services of the horses which perished during the Anglo Boer War, 1899-1902, took place on Saturday afternoon, February 11, 1905, with His Worship the Mayor, Mr A Fettes, performing the ceremony.\"\n\n\n=== Apartheid era ===\nUnder apartheid, the South African government established legal racial segregation and started programs to separate communities physically as well as by classification and custom. The forced relocation under the auspices of the Group Areas Act of the non-white population from mixed areas began in 1962, causing various townships to be built for their use. Classification was sometimes arbitrary, and as in many other localities throughout the country, many citizens appearing to have mixed ancestry were at times subject to re-classification, which often had intrusive sociopolitical results. The non-white tenants of South End, and land owners in Fairview were forcibly relocated from 1965 through to 1975, as these areas were valued as prime real estate. The city-planning was viewed as the prototypical apartheid city.\nAs black South Africans organized to try to achieve civil rights and social justice, government repression increased. In 1977 Steve Biko, the black anti-apartheid activist, was interrogated and tortured by the security police in Port Elizabeth before being transported to Pretoria, where he died. Other notable deaths in the city during this time included those of The Cradock Four, and of George Botha, a high-school teacher.\n\n\n==== 1952 Defiance Campaign ====\nIn 1952 the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress (SAIC) called all South Africans to stand up against the apartheid government's unjust laws directed at the black African, Indian and coloured population. On April 6, while most white South Africans celebrated the tercentenary of Jan van Riebeeck's arrival at the Cape in 1652, the ANC and SAIC called on black South Africans to observe the day as a \"A National Day of Pledge and Prayer\". 15 000 people attended in Johannesburg, 10 000 in Cape Town, 10 000 in Durban and 20 000 in Port Elizabeth. The meeting in Port Elizabeth was led by Professor Z. K. Matthews and by Raymond Mhlaba.\nOn 25 July 1952, a day before the official start of the Defiance Campaign, 30 volunteers led by Raymond Mhlaba gathered at the New Brighton Civic Centre and prayed throughout the night. At 5am on 26 July, they left the Civic Centre and walked towards the New Brighton Railway Station. In Raymond Mhlaba's Personal Memoirs: Reminiscing from Rwanda and Uganda, Mhlaba recalled:\n\n\"I led the very first group and we entered the 'Europeans Only' section of the New Brighton station. By half past six we were already in police vans on our way to jail. It turned out that my party (group) was the very first to defy unjust laws in the whole of South Africa. Little did we know that we were making history.\"\n\nMhlaba became the first man to be arrested during the campaign, while Florence Matomela was the first woman. 2 007 people were arrested in Port Elizabeth during the Defiance Campaign included Oom Gov (Govan Mbeki) and Vuyisile Mini. Other volunteers who emerged as key role players during the campaign included Nosipho Dastile, Nontuthuzelo Mabala, Lilian Diedricks and Veronica Sobukwe.\n\n\n==== 1985 Consumer Boycotts ====\nAfter the formation of the ANC-affiliated United Democratic Front in 1983, political consciousness in black townships grew. With numerous protests across the country and the massacre in Langa township near Uitenhage, Eastern Cape police presence had increased in South African townships. In Port Elizabeth townships, black South Africans demanded the integration of public institutions, the removal of troops from black townships, and the end of workplace discrimination. To launch an effective campaign to cripple the white-owned institutions of Port Elizabeth and to undermine the legitimacy of apartheid, several women suggested the idea of a consumer boycott to the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO) in May 1985. The economic boycott began on July 15, 1985, and received massive support in townships around Port Elizabeth. By September 1985, white business-owners became desperate and called on the government to meet the demands of black South Africans. In November the boycott was still hurting white businesses in Port Elizabeth greatly. The white South African government reached an agreement with PEBCO which stated that the boycott would halt until March 1986 if business owners arranged for the release of black leaders.In 1986, as the deal was approaching its end, the boycotters imposed a deadline of March 31, stating that the boycott would resume if the initial demands were not met. On March 11, the government unexpectedly banned two leaders, one of whom was Mkuseli Jack. However, on March 22, the ban was lifted by the decision of a Supreme Court Justice on the grounds that the government had given insufficient reasons. Jack ripped up the ban papers, and used the celebration as a way to represent the solidarity that the campaign required. As the demands of the boycotters were not met by March 31, the boycott was renewed on April 1. The boycott continued for nine weeks, but on June 12, 1986, another state of emergency was imposed by the National Party government. Security forces searched through the townships, arresting thousands and raiding the offices of black civics, trade unions, the UDF, the South African Council, and churches and also confiscating documents.\n\n\n=== Modern History ===\nWith the establishment of the  Coega Industrial Development Zone (CIDZ), foreign direct and also national-level investment has improved substantially in the region of Nelson Mandela Bay/Port Elizabeth. The IDZ, under the stewardship of the Coega Development Corporation (CDC), since inception has managed to attract to its investment account in excess of R140-billion into the economy of the Eastern Cape and has enabled the creation of over 45 000 jobs. This is significant for the sustainability of the IDZ, Nelson Mandela Bay, and the economy of the Eastern Cape. The CDC consistently continues to demonstrate its capability as the leading catalyst for socio-economic growth in the Eastern Cape, with a view to becoming so for South Africa.\nIn 2001 the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality was formed as an administrative area covering Port Elizabeth, the neighbouring towns of Uitenhage and Despatch and the surrounding agricultural areas. The name honours former President Nelson Mandela. The combined metropolitan area had a population estimated at around 1.3 million in 2006.\n\n\n==== 2010 FIFA World Cup ====\nOvertaking its next door neighbouring city East London, Port Elizabeth became the host city for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium hosted eight World Cup games were South Korea vs Greece, Ivory Coast vs Portugal, Germany vs Serbia; Chile vs Switzerland, Slovenia vs England in the Group Stage, then Uruguay, South Korea in the Round of 16. A quarter-final between Netherlands, Brazil was hosted, then for the Third Place playoff, Uruguay, Germany were hosted at the stadium. The World Cup was played between 11 June 2010 and 11 July 2010. Spain were the eventual champions.\n\n\n==== 2013 Africa Cup of Nations ====\nPort Elizabeth was also one of the five cities that hosted the 2013 Afcon event. Same stadium of 2010 World Cup hosted eight games: five matches of Group B included Ghana, DR Congo; Mali, Niger; Ghana, Mali; DR. Congo, Niger; Ghana, Niger; one match of Group A Cape Verde, Angola. Quarterfinal Ghana, Cape Verde, then Third Place playoff Ghana, Mali. The Africa Cup of Nations took place between 19 January and 10 February 2013. Nigeria were eventual champions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Port Elizabeth has an oceanic climate (Cfb\u202f). The area lies between the winter rainfall, Mediterranean climate zones of the Western Cape and the summer rainfall regions of eastern South Africa. Winters are cool but mild and summers are warm but considerably less humid and hot than more northerly parts of South Africa's east coast. The climate is very even throughout the year with extreme heat or moderate cold rare.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nPort Elizabeth represents a large percentage of South Africa's biological diversity and the city is a confluence point five of the seven South African biomes, namely the Thicket, Grassland, Nama-Karoo, Fynbos and Forest Biomes. A number of municipal nature reserves have been included in, and can be visited along the \u201cOutward Bound Route\u201d of the city. A mosaic of these 5 Biomes could be experienced in these reserves. The outward bound route is an eco-outdoor adventure and sports route incorporating walking and wildlife experiences. The aim of this route is to spread tourism to similar attractions along the route, leading to increased foot traffic and related benefits to these sites.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nAs a British colonial town, the city had a strongly British character, and the central area retains that to this day. Few of the buildings featured in this tour would be out of place in an English market town.  The colonial City Hall is a national monument. The Port Elizabeth main public library is an excellent example of Victorian Gothic architecture. Various memorials are situated throughout the city environs, and there are many tours available to familiarise visitors with especially the apartheid era. Port Elizabeth could be considered to be the country's leading centre of Art Nouveau style architecture due to its European heritage. Many buildings display the intricate stonework, wrought iron and stained glass of that era which are prominently visible in the Central Historical areas of the city. Combinations of Art Nouveau and Colonial styles are seen in residences along Cape Road.The area also boasts a collection of Cape Dutch style architecture as well as the Victorian and Edwardian styles, resulting from the arrival of the 1820 British settlers. Although influenced by Dutch architecture, the Cape Dutch style is unique to South Africa and examples can be seen all over the Eastern and Western Cape. \n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\nPort Elizabeth has numerous water features in its encompassing area.  There is a vast length of marine coastline on the city's outer encroachments particularly southwards. Beaches like Kings Beach, Hobie Beach, Bluewater Bay, Sardinia Bay, and the beaches along Marine Drive are abundant. Kings Beach is adjacent to Port Elizabeth's harbour, and the longshore drift from Cape Recife provides a plentiful supply of sea sand. On the north westerly coastline of Port Elizabeth, the contours tends to be rockier than the area between Cape Recife, and the Port of Ngqura. Port Elizabeth has a few rivers, of which the Baakens River is the most prominent. This river usually floods when a reasonable amount precipitation is observed, especially at low level crossings. North End Lake is the largest natural freshwater body in Port Elizabeth, but has experienced a form of contamination from industry. (It is not recommended to ingest anything from this lake) Also, numerous smaller \"lakes\" are in the surrounding area, namely Lake Farm.  Port Elizabeth (as a whole, the entire Eastern Cape) is experiencing a devastating drought, of which a disaster has been declared by the current office bearers of the greater municipality. Water restrictions are in place, and measures are in place to provide enough water in the near future, namely freshwater treatment works being constructed to acquire additional water from the Gariep Dam.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPort Elizabeth is the most populous city in the Eastern Cape. In 2001:\nArea: 335.3 square kilometres (129.5 sq mi)\nPopulation: 237,502: 708.32 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,834.5/sq mi)\nHouseholds: 70,606: 210.58 per square kilometre (545.4/sq mi)\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Trade and industry ===\nThe largest economic sectors in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro are manufacturing, finance, community services and transport. Community services, trade and manufacturing sectors are the sectors that create the most employment in the Metro. The city offers a wealth of tourism and recreation opportunity due to its biodiversity, beaches and open spaces.  Further still, Nelson Mandela Bay is a preferred region for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, flour, meat, frozen veggies, soft drinks, chocolates, cheese, yoghurt, ice-cream, paper and leather products.Historically, the majority of trade in the region came through Port Elizabeth. In the 1830s, at least five ships regularly transported goods to Europe. It became a free port in 1832. In 1833, about 50 vessels had moved through the port. In 1828, 55,201 pounds, (25038 kg), of goods were imported through the port, increasing by 1832 to 112,845 pounds, (51185 kg), imported in that year. Port Elizabeth exported 41,290 pounds, (18738 kg), in 1828, with a large increase to 86,931 pounds, (39431 kg), goods exported in 1829. Exports included wine, brandy, vinegar, ivory, hides and skins, leather, tallow, butter, soap, wool, ostrich feathers, salted beef, wheat, candles, aloe, barley, and more.Home of South Africa's motor vehicle industry, Port Elizabeth boasts most vehicle assembly plants, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Continental Tyres and many other automotive-related companies. As of 2018, after GM's exit from Port Elizabeth and South Africa, Isuzu took over their production plant in Struandale. In 2016, Chinese state-owned automotive manufacturer BAIC and South Africa's Industrial Development Corporation announced a R11 billion joint venture for the establishment of a semi knock down vehicle assembly plant in Coega.  It is anticipated that the plant will go online in 2020.  The FAW also have built a multi-billion rand plant in the region. Most other industries in Port Elizabeth are geared towards the motor vehicle industry, providing parts such as wiring harnesses, catalytic converters, batteries and tyres to the vehicle manufacturers.\nPort Elizabeth is also a major seaport, with the most significant car loading facilities in the southern hemisphere. As part of the ongoing development, a new Industrial Development Zone with expanded port facilities has been built at Coega.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nLocated at the end of the picturesque Garden Route along the Cape coast, the city has beaches in and near it. The most popular swimming beaches include King's Beach and Hobie Beach.\nMany local historic attractions are linked by the Donkin Heritage Trail. These include the Campanile (bell tower), built in 1923 to commemorate the arrival of the 1820 Settlers and offering a viewpoint over the city; the city hall (1862); the Donkin Reserve park and monument; and the old stone Fort Frederick itself (1799). The CBD also boasts the towering Eastern Cape post office headquarters.\nRoute 67 is a walking trail consisting of 67 public artworks, symbolising 67 years which Nelson Mandela dedicated to the freedom of South Africa. The artwork is a celebration of South African culture and history and is scattered along the route as it starts from the Campanile, up the stairs to the Vuysile Mini Market Square and to the large South African flag at the Donkin Reserve. The artworks were created by local Eastern Cape artists.Other attractions include the gardens at St George's Park, the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum (formerly known as the King George VI Art Gallery), the museum and oceanography room at Humewood, and the new Boardwalk waterfront complex.\nThe wider area surrounding PE also features game viewing opportunities, including the Addo Elephant National Park, 72 kilometres (45 mi) to the north near the Zuurberg mountain range.\nPort Elizabeth is also a destination for whale watching with humpback whales sighted between June and August, and again between November and January, southern right whales sighted between July and November, and Bryde's whales sighted all year round.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe biggest sporting events in Port Elizabeth, is the annual Ironman triathlon and the Herald Cycle tour. The Tuna classic deep-sea fishing competition attracts anglers from all over the world.\nThe city has facilities catering for cricket, rugby union, athletics, association football, field hockey and many other sports. Its coastal location also makes it a base for many watersports.\nPort Elizabeth is the location of the St George's Park cricket ground, which holds test cricket matches. St George's Park is the oldest cricket ground in South Africa, and was the venue for the first Test match played outside of Australia or England, between South Africa and England on 12 and 13 March 1889. The Warriors, a franchise cricket team in South Africa, is based in Port Elizabeth. The stadium is also known for its band that entertains fans at the Proteas games.\nThe headquarters of the Southern Spears rugby franchise was in Port Elizabeth. The long-standing Eastern Province Rugby Union, now commonly known as the Eastern Province Elephants, formed the basis of the Spears franchise together with East London's Border Bulldogs. The remnants of the Spears were later reconstituted into the Southern Kings, also based in Port Elizabeth, which joined Super Rugby in 2013. The Southern Kings did not participate in Super Rugby in 2014 or 2015, and returned to Super Rugby in 2016, 2017, but were dropped for economical reasons by SARU. The team now competes in the Guinness Pro14. The Eastern Province Rugby Union play their home matches at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, built for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn December 2011, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium became the new home of the South Africa Sevens, the country's leg of the annual IRB Sevens World Series in rugby sevens. The event had previously been held in three other cities, most recently in George in the Western Cape from 2002 to 2010. As of 2015, is hosted annually in Cape Town, in the Western Cape.\nThe city's main football club is Chippa United, they currently use the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium as their home ground. Previous clubs to play in the country's top tier were Bay United, Michau Warriors, Port Elizabeth Blackpool, Hotspur F.C., Port Elizabeth City and Westview Apollon.\nThe Algoa Bay Yacht Club operates out of the Port of Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n== Government ==\nPort Elizabeth had its own municipality from 1843 to 2000.  Since then, it has formed part of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, and serves as the seat for the surrounding Cacadu District Municipality. It has a Magistrate's Court, a local seat of the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court, and a branch of the Labour Court. As a result of the presence of a High Court, several other related organs of state such as a Masters Office and a Director of Public Prosecutions are present in the city.\nAll Government (mostly provincial) departments maintain branches or other offices in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe Port Elizabeth municipality assumed a coat of arms on 9 January 1878.  The design, prepared by Bradbury Wilkinson and Company (of London), was a simplified version of the arms of Sir Rufane Donkin : Gules,  on a chevron Argent between two cinquefoils in chief and a bugle horn stringed in base Or, three buckles Sable;  a chief embattled Argent thereon an elephant statant proper.  The crest was a sailing ship, and the motto In meliora spera.\n(In layman's terms : a red shield displaying, from top to bottom, an elephant on a silver horizontal strip whose lower edge is embattled, two gold cinquefoils, a silver chevron bearing three black buckles, and a gold bugle horn.)\nEighty years later, in 1958, the council made slight changes to the arms, and had them granted by the College of Arms.  The changes consisted of adding two anchors to the chief of the shield, placing a red mural crown bearing three golden rings below the ship in the crest, and changing the motto to Tu meliora spera.  The arms were registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in 1959, and at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1986.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University Level ===\nThe Nelson Mandela University was formed by the amalgamation of the University of Port Elizabeth, Port Elizabeth Technikon, and the Port Elizabeth campus of Vista University. It is the largest university in the Eastern and Southern Cape, with around 29,000 students in seven faculties spread over seven campuses.\nRussell Road College and AFDA also have campuses in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== High School Level ===\nThe city has a number of top government-funded and private schools, although the abuse of substances seems to prevail in some schools due to a lack of drug prevention training on the part of the educational system, including Alexander Road High School, Collegiate Girls' High School, Victoria Park High School, Grey High School, Pearson High School, Woodridge College, Andrew Rabie High School and Lawson Brown High School.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nPort Elizabeth lies on the N2 road. To the west the road travels the Garden Route to George and Cape Town; to the east, the road runs through the Border Country through Makhanda, to East London then on to Durban, terminating in Ermelo in Mpumalanga. The R75 connects Port Elizabeth to the Karoo. The major routes within the city are numbered as metropolitan or M routes.\nThe city's main bus station is in Market Square. The public bus service is run by the Algoa Bus Company.  Between 1881 and 1948, there was a Port Elizabeth tramway network, powered initially by horses, and later by electricity.\nThe city is in the process of building a bus rapid transit system which was intended for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This has been a massive failure as local taxi associations have prevented the implementation. Port Elizabeth lacks a proper public transport system which has had a negative impact on the poorer residents of the city who are dependent on public transport. Construction of the bus rapid transit network has been suspended due to mismanagement which led to the project missing its May 2010 deadline. Calls for the project, which has left many parts of the city in a permanent state of construction, have been made recently, and it is expected that the government will make a decision on the matter soon.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nPort Elizabeth railway station is served by South Africa's rail network. Local commuter services are operated by Metrorail, while the Shosholoza Meyl long-distance passenger service links PE with Johannesburg via Bloemfontein where it is possible to connect with other long-distance routes.The Apple Express narrow-gauge tourist train to Avontuur operated from the separate station in Humewood Road near King's Beach. It departed regularly for Thornhill Village via Van Stadens River bridge, the highest narrow-gauge rail bridge in the world. The Apple Express was launched to provide a service to transport fresh produce and wood from the farms along the line to Avontuur. The line was completed in 1914 and the train delivered produce directly from the farms to ships in the Port Elizabeth Harbour. Due to modern transport methods such as containerisation, and refrigerated containers and trucks, the Apple Express and its services became redundant. Service has now ceased.\nIn preparation for the 2010 World Cup Soccer event the Humerail Station was extensively upgraded. Several disused narrow gauge goods wagons were scrapped and removed from the site, several buildings in the area have also been renovated and revamped.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nPort Elizabeth Airport (IATA airport code PLZ, ICAO airport code FAPE) serves the city for both passenger and cargo traffic. It is the fourth busiest airport in South Africa after O.R. Tambo International Airport, King Shaka International Airport in Durban, and Cape Town International Airport.\nInternational visitors to the city must currently fly to either Johannesburg, Cape Town or Durban, and then take a domestic flight to Port Elizabeth. An upgrade to the terminal building, completed in 2004, created the necessary facilities to handle international flights although none are scheduled as yet.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nPort Elizabeth has a harbour in Algoa Bay, and the construction of an additional international harbour at Coega has supported an increase in the size of the city's industries and the addition of new industries.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city has government-funded and private hospitals, including:\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nPort Elizabeth is served by a few radio outlets, namely Algoa FM, Umhlobo Wenene FM (radio broadcasting to the residents of Port Elizabeth, as well as the entire Eastern Cape, and Garden Route, and globally, online.)\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nThe Herald serves the English populace in terms of newspaper, on a daily basis. Die Burger serves the Afrikaans communities as well with a well established readership base.\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nThere are various social media news groups in Port Elizabeth, which is used at most as neighbourhood watch groups.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe SABC has a regional office in Port Elizabeth.  Bay TV is a free-to-air station established by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality that broadcasts 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. The station focusses on African story-telling and creating platforms for local content creators, and receives funding from local government and corporate donors.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n Beira, Mozambique\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nRed Location Museum\nList of heritage sites in Port Elizabeth\nFort Frederick, Eastern Cape\nBloemendal\nNational Monument\nVictorian era\nDonkin Heritage Trail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPort Elizabeth of Yore: The Defiance Campaign of 1952",

        "wiki": "Port Elizabeth or Nelson Mandela Bay (Xhosa: iBhayi, alternatively Gqebera; Afrikaans: Die Baai [di \u02c8b\u0251\u02d0i]) often known by its initials PE, and colloquially as \u201cThe Friendly City\u201dor \"The Windy City\", is a major seaport city and most populous city in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.  Port Elizabeth is the seat of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa's second largest metropolitan district by area.  It is the most-populous city of the Eastern Cape and the sixth most-populous city in South Africa. the most-populous city of Eastern Cape; and the cultural, economic and financial center of the Eastern Cape.  The city is among the top five cities in the world for pleasant weather, according to a 2014 scientific climate study of 600 global cities.  Port Elizabeth is known for many blue-flag beaches along the city's urban coastline; its popularity as an international and local holiday destination; and its rich and diverse cultural heritage.  It is a tourism gateway city for the Eastern Cape and the only city with the closest proximity to malaria-free big five game reserves.The economy of Port Elizabeth is primarily oriented towards automotive assembly, manufacturing and export industries, and the city is also a major South African and sub-Saharan African destination for investment. Foreign direct investments of $19,8 billion has been secured over the past decade. Several Fortune 500 companies have a presence or their African operations headquartered in Port Elizabeth. The city's most prominent landmarks are Shark Rock pier, the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, and the Donkin Reserve.\nPort Elizabeth is a popular domestic and international holiday destination.  It is a gateway city for Eastern Cape's adventure, outdoor and African big five game, malaria-free safari tourism.Port Elizabeth is located in the south eastern coast of South Africa.  It is situated on the western portion of Algoa Bay, adjacent to the Indian Ocean.  The city lies 770 km east of Cape Town, between South Africa's Garden Route and Wild Coast.  Port Elizabeth covers 251 square kilometers of the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area, South Africa's sixth largest metropolitan municipality. Fortune 500 companies are present or have their African operations headquartered in the city.  Port Elizabeth is the second oldest city in South Africa.  It was founded in 1820 by the government of the Cape Colony when 4,000 British colonists settled Algoa Bay to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa. The city's moderate subtropical climate ranks among the top ten cities in the world for highly pleasant, all year round weather, according to a Syracuse University climatology study.Port Elizabeth is a popular tourist holiday destination. Shark Rock Pier, a prominent installation on the shoreline of Port Elizabeth's Summerstrand precinct, is the city's most famous landmark.  Port Elizabeth is a tourism gateway city for big five game viewing, South Africa's national's arts festival, outdoor recreation, adventure tourism and numerous nature conservancies, including the Baviaanskloof mega-reserve, Port Elizabeth was one of the host cities for the official tournament of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-History ===\nCave sites not far from Port Elizabeth, such as Albany, Wilton and Howiesons Poort, have given their names to various archaeological cultures. The Howiesons Poort has been of particular interest to interpretations about the origins of fully modern human behaviour. Dating to 65 000 to 62 000 years ago, it has yielded extremely old evidence for bow and arrow hunting and shell-bead jewellery. Earlier and Middle Stone Age lithic material has been found in the Sundays River Valley, while at the important site of Amanzi Springs, 40 km north of the Port Elizabeth near Addo, Earlier Stone Age artefacts are found in situ with well-preserved plant and faunal remains within spring sediments (Deacon, 1970). There is Later Stone Age archaeological material preserved in caves and rock shelters, such as Melkhoutboom Cave, in the Cape Fold Belt Mountain surrounding Port Elizabeth (see Deacon and Deacon, 1963; Deacon, 1976; Binneman, 1997) and large numbers of coastal shell middens have been reported at Humewood, St. George's Strand and the Coega River Mouth (Rudner, 1968). Most recently, Binneman and Webley (1997) reported thirteen shell middens and stone tool scatters about 500 m east of the Coega River mouth in the archaeological assessment carried out for the development of maritime infrastructure for the Port of Ngqura. Importantly, some of this archaeological material was recorded in secondary context in the gravels from older river terraces along the banks of the Coega River.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nIn 1820, the rising seaport of Algoa Bay was named  \"Port Elizabeth\" in memory of Elizabeth Frances n\u00e9e Markham, the late wife of Rufane Shaw Donkin, acting Governor of the Cape Colony.  In 2019, the Eastern Cape Geographical Names Committee (ECGNC) announced the city of Port Elizabeth is likely to have its name changed to Gqeberha, a Xhosa word used to refer to the Baakens River that flows through the city.\n\n\n=== Early History ===\nHunters and gatherers ancestral to the San first settled the area around what is now called Algoa Bay at least 10,000 years ago. Around 2,000 years ago, they were gradually displaced or assimilated by agriculturalist populations ancestral to the Xhosa people, who migrated into the region from the north.\n\n\n=== British Settlement ===\nThe first Europeans to visit the area sailed with the Portuguese explorers Bartholomeu Dias, who landed on St Croix Island in Algoa Bay in 1488, and Vasco da Gama, who noted the nearby Bird Island in 1497. For centuries, the area appeared on European navigation charts marked simply as \"a landing place with fresh water\".The Portuguese Crown had as one of its main goals in the Indian Ocean taking over the lucrative trade of Arab and Afro-Arabian merchants who plied routes between the East African coast and India. As they took over that trade in Africa, the Portuguese strengthened trading with Goa, their main trading point in India. The name Algoa means \"to Goa\", just as the port further north in present-day Mozambique, Delagoa means \"from Goa\" in Portuguese.The area became part of the Cape Colony. This area had a turbulent history between the settlement by the Dutch East India Company in 1652 and the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910.\n\nIn 1799, at the time of the first British occupation of the Colony during the Napoleonic Wars, British troops built a stone fort named Fort Frederick after the Duke of York. This fort, aiming to deter a possible landing of French troops, was constructed to oversee the site of what later became Port Elizabeth. The fort is now preserved as a monument.From 1814 to 1821 the Strandfontein farm was owned by Piet Retief. He later became a Voortrekker leader and was killed in 1837 by Zulu king Dingane during negotiations about land. An estimated 500 men, woman and children of his party were massacred. Frederik Korsten owned the Strandfontein farm after Retief. The suburb of Korsten was named after Frederick in the 19th century. This area was later developed as the Summerstrand beach suburb of Port Elizabeth.In 1820 a party of 4,000 British settlers arrived by sea, encouraged by the government of the Cape Colony to form a settlement to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa people. At this time the seaport town was founded by Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin, the Acting Governor of the Cape Colony (in office: 1820-1821). \nDiplomat Edmund Roberts visited Port Elizabeth in the early 1830s. Roberts noted that Port Elizabeth in the 1820s had \"contained four houses, and now it has upward of one hundred houses, and its residents are rated at above twelve hundred persons\".The Roman Catholic Church established the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope, Eastern District in the city in 1847. Port Elizabeth was granted the status of autonomous municipality in 1861. \nCape Colony Prime Minister John Molteno had formed the Cape Government Railways in 1872. Completion of the railway to Kimberley in 1873 was a major stimulus to trade and a rapid increase in population in the town. With the massive expansion of the Cape Colony's railway network to the interior over the following years, the harbour of Port Elizabeth became the focus for serving import and export needs of a large area of the Cape's hinterland. The rapid economic development around the port, which followed the railway construction, caused Port Elizabeth to be nicknamed \"the Liverpool of South Africa\", after a major British port. The town expanded as a diverse community, comprising Xhosa as well as European, Cape Malay, and other immigrants.\n\nDuring the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902, the port served as an important transit-point for British soldiers, horses, and materials headed by railway to the front. No armed conflict took place within the city, but it felt the effects of the war with the arrival of many refugees who moved into the city. These included Boer women and children, whom the British interned in a concentration camp. \nAfter the war, the British erected a monument to military horses that died during the war. \"The unveiling of the monument commemorating the services of the horses which perished during the Anglo Boer War, 1899-1902, took place on Saturday afternoon, February 11, 1905, with His Worship the Mayor, Mr A Fettes, performing the ceremony.\"\n\n\n=== Apartheid era ===\nUnder apartheid, the South African government established legal racial segregation and started programs to separate communities physically as well as by classification and custom. The forced relocation under the auspices of the Group Areas Act of the non-white population from mixed areas began in 1962, causing various townships to be built for their use. Classification was sometimes arbitrary, and as in many other localities throughout the country, many citizens appearing to have mixed ancestry were at times subject to re-classification, which often had intrusive sociopolitical results. The non-white tenants of South End, and land owners in Fairview were forcibly relocated from 1965 through to 1975, as these areas were valued as prime real estate. The city-planning was viewed as the prototypical apartheid city.\nAs black South Africans organized to try to achieve civil rights and social justice, government repression increased. In 1977 Steve Biko, the black anti-apartheid activist, was interrogated and tortured by the security police in Port Elizabeth before being transported to Pretoria, where he died. Other notable deaths in the city during this time included those of The Cradock Four, and of George Botha, a high-school teacher.\n\n\n==== 1952 Defiance Campaign ====\nIn 1952 the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress (SAIC) called all South Africans to stand up against the apartheid government's unjust laws directed at the black African, Indian and coloured population. On April 6, while most white South Africans celebrated the tercentenary of Jan van Riebeeck's arrival at the Cape in 1652, the ANC and SAIC called on black South Africans to observe the day as a \"A National Day of Pledge and Prayer\". 15 000 people attended in Johannesburg, 10 000 in Cape Town, 10 000 in Durban and 20 000 in Port Elizabeth. The meeting in Port Elizabeth was led by Professor Z. K. Matthews and by Raymond Mhlaba.\nOn 25 July 1952, a day before the official start of the Defiance Campaign, 30 volunteers led by Raymond Mhlaba gathered at the New Brighton Civic Centre and prayed throughout the night. At 5am on 26 July, they left the Civic Centre and walked towards the New Brighton Railway Station. In Raymond Mhlaba's Personal Memoirs: Reminiscing from Rwanda and Uganda, Mhlaba recalled:\n\n\"I led the very first group and we entered the 'Europeans Only' section of the New Brighton station. By half past six we were already in police vans on our way to jail. It turned out that my party (group) was the very first to defy unjust laws in the whole of South Africa. Little did we know that we were making history.\"\n\nMhlaba became the first man to be arrested during the campaign, while Florence Matomela was the first woman. 2 007 people were arrested in Port Elizabeth during the Defiance Campaign included Oom Gov (Govan Mbeki) and Vuyisile Mini. Other volunteers who emerged as key role players during the campaign included Nosipho Dastile, Nontuthuzelo Mabala, Lilian Diedricks and Veronica Sobukwe.\n\n\n==== 1985 Consumer Boycotts ====\nAfter the formation of the ANC-affiliated United Democratic Front in 1983, political consciousness in black townships grew. With numerous protests across the country and the massacre in Langa township near Uitenhage, Eastern Cape police presence had increased in South African townships. In Port Elizabeth townships, black South Africans demanded the integration of public institutions, the removal of troops from black townships, and the end of workplace discrimination. To launch an effective campaign to cripple the white-owned institutions of Port Elizabeth and to undermine the legitimacy of apartheid, several women suggested the idea of a consumer boycott to the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO) in May 1985. The economic boycott began on July 15, 1985, and received massive support in townships around Port Elizabeth. By September 1985, white business-owners became desperate and called on the government to meet the demands of black South Africans. In November the boycott was still hurting white businesses in Port Elizabeth greatly. The white South African government reached an agreement with PEBCO which stated that the boycott would halt until March 1986 if business owners arranged for the release of black leaders.In 1986, as the deal was approaching its end, the boycotters imposed a deadline of March 31, stating that the boycott would resume if the initial demands were not met. On March 11, the government unexpectedly banned two leaders, one of whom was Mkuseli Jack. However, on March 22, the ban was lifted by the decision of a Supreme Court Justice on the grounds that the government had given insufficient reasons. Jack ripped up the ban papers, and used the celebration as a way to represent the solidarity that the campaign required. As the demands of the boycotters were not met by March 31, the boycott was renewed on April 1. The boycott continued for nine weeks, but on June 12, 1986, another state of emergency was imposed by the National Party government. Security forces searched through the townships, arresting thousands and raiding the offices of black civics, trade unions, the UDF, the South African Council, and churches and also confiscating documents.\n\n\n=== Modern History ===\nWith the establishment of the  Coega Industrial Development Zone (CIDZ), foreign direct and also national-level investment has improved substantially in the region of Nelson Mandela Bay/Port Elizabeth. The IDZ, under the stewardship of the Coega Development Corporation (CDC), since inception has managed to attract to its investment account in excess of R140-billion into the economy of the Eastern Cape and has enabled the creation of over 45 000 jobs. This is significant for the sustainability of the IDZ, Nelson Mandela Bay, and the economy of the Eastern Cape. The CDC consistently continues to demonstrate its capability as the leading catalyst for socio-economic growth in the Eastern Cape, with a view to becoming so for South Africa.\nIn 2001 the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality was formed as an administrative area covering Port Elizabeth, the neighbouring towns of Uitenhage and Despatch and the surrounding agricultural areas. The name honours former President Nelson Mandela. The combined metropolitan area had a population estimated at around 1.3 million in 2006.\n\n\n==== 2010 FIFA World Cup ====\nOvertaking its next door neighbouring city East London, Port Elizabeth became the host city for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium hosted eight World Cup games were South Korea vs Greece, Ivory Coast vs Portugal, Germany vs Serbia; Chile vs Switzerland, Slovenia vs England in the Group Stage, then Uruguay, South Korea in the Round of 16. A quarter-final between Netherlands, Brazil was hosted, then for the Third Place playoff, Uruguay, Germany were hosted at the stadium. The World Cup was played between 11 June 2010 and 11 July 2010. Spain were the eventual champions.\n\n\n==== 2013 Africa Cup of Nations ====\nPort Elizabeth was also one of the five cities that hosted the 2013 Afcon event. Same stadium of 2010 World Cup hosted eight games: five matches of Group B included Ghana, DR Congo; Mali, Niger; Ghana, Mali; DR. Congo, Niger; Ghana, Niger; one match of Group A Cape Verde, Angola. Quarterfinal Ghana, Cape Verde, then Third Place playoff Ghana, Mali. The Africa Cup of Nations took place between 19 January and 10 February 2013. Nigeria were eventual champions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Port Elizabeth has an oceanic climate (Cfb\u202f). The area lies between the winter rainfall, Mediterranean climate zones of the Western Cape and the summer rainfall regions of eastern South Africa. Winters are cool but mild and summers are warm but considerably less humid and hot than more northerly parts of South Africa's east coast. The climate is very even throughout the year with extreme heat or moderate cold rare.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nPort Elizabeth represents a large percentage of South Africa's biological diversity and the city is a confluence point five of the seven South African biomes, namely the Thicket, Grassland, Nama-Karoo, Fynbos and Forest Biomes. A number of municipal nature reserves have been included in, and can be visited along the \u201cOutward Bound Route\u201d of the city. A mosaic of these 5 Biomes could be experienced in these reserves. The outward bound route is an eco-outdoor adventure and sports route incorporating walking and wildlife experiences. The aim of this route is to spread tourism to similar attractions along the route, leading to increased foot traffic and related benefits to these sites.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nAs a British colonial town, the city had a strongly British character, and the central area retains that to this day. Few of the buildings featured in this tour would be out of place in an English market town.  The colonial City Hall is a national monument. The Port Elizabeth main public library is an excellent example of Victorian Gothic architecture. Various memorials are situated throughout the city environs, and there are many tours available to familiarise visitors with especially the apartheid era. Port Elizabeth could be considered to be the country's leading centre of Art Nouveau style architecture due to its European heritage. Many buildings display the intricate stonework, wrought iron and stained glass of that era which are prominently visible in the Central Historical areas of the city. Combinations of Art Nouveau and Colonial styles are seen in residences along Cape Road.The area also boasts a collection of Cape Dutch style architecture as well as the Victorian and Edwardian styles, resulting from the arrival of the 1820 British settlers. Although influenced by Dutch architecture, the Cape Dutch style is unique to South Africa and examples can be seen all over the Eastern and Western Cape. \n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\nPort Elizabeth has numerous water features in its encompassing area.  There is a vast length of marine coastline on the city's outer encroachments particularly southwards. Beaches like Kings Beach, Hobie Beach, Bluewater Bay, Sardinia Bay, and the beaches along Marine Drive are abundant. Kings Beach is adjacent to Port Elizabeth's harbour, and the longshore drift from Cape Recife provides a plentiful supply of sea sand. On the north westerly coastline of Port Elizabeth, the contours tends to be rockier than the area between Cape Recife, and the Port of Ngqura. Port Elizabeth has a few rivers, of which the Baakens River is the most prominent. This river usually floods when a reasonable amount precipitation is observed, especially at low level crossings. North End Lake is the largest natural freshwater body in Port Elizabeth, but has experienced a form of contamination from industry. (It is not recommended to ingest anything from this lake) Also, numerous smaller \"lakes\" are in the surrounding area, namely Lake Farm.  Port Elizabeth (as a whole, the entire Eastern Cape) is experiencing a devastating drought, of which a disaster has been declared by the current office bearers of the greater municipality. Water restrictions are in place, and measures are in place to provide enough water in the near future, namely freshwater treatment works being constructed to acquire additional water from the Gariep Dam.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPort Elizabeth is the most populous city in the Eastern Cape. In 2001:\nArea: 335.3 square kilometres (129.5 sq mi)\nPopulation: 237,502: 708.32 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,834.5/sq mi)\nHouseholds: 70,606: 210.58 per square kilometre (545.4/sq mi)\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Trade and industry ===\nThe largest economic sectors in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro are manufacturing, finance, community services and transport. Community services, trade and manufacturing sectors are the sectors that create the most employment in the Metro. The city offers a wealth of tourism and recreation opportunity due to its biodiversity, beaches and open spaces.  Further still, Nelson Mandela Bay is a preferred region for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, flour, meat, frozen veggies, soft drinks, chocolates, cheese, yoghurt, ice-cream, paper and leather products.Historically, the majority of trade in the region came through Port Elizabeth. In the 1830s, at least five ships regularly transported goods to Europe. It became a free port in 1832. In 1833, about 50 vessels had moved through the port. In 1828, 55,201 pounds, (25038 kg), of goods were imported through the port, increasing by 1832 to 112,845 pounds, (51185 kg), imported in that year. Port Elizabeth exported 41,290 pounds, (18738 kg), in 1828, with a large increase to 86,931 pounds, (39431 kg), goods exported in 1829. Exports included wine, brandy, vinegar, ivory, hides and skins, leather, tallow, butter, soap, wool, ostrich feathers, salted beef, wheat, candles, aloe, barley, and more.Home of South Africa's motor vehicle industry, Port Elizabeth boasts most vehicle assembly plants, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Continental Tyres and many other automotive-related companies. As of 2018, after GM's exit from Port Elizabeth and South Africa, Isuzu took over their production plant in Struandale. In 2016, Chinese state-owned automotive manufacturer BAIC and South Africa's Industrial Development Corporation announced a R11 billion joint venture for the establishment of a semi knock down vehicle assembly plant in Coega.  It is anticipated that the plant will go online in 2020.  The FAW also have built a multi-billion rand plant in the region. Most other industries in Port Elizabeth are geared towards the motor vehicle industry, providing parts such as wiring harnesses, catalytic converters, batteries and tyres to the vehicle manufacturers.\nPort Elizabeth is also a major seaport, with the most significant car loading facilities in the southern hemisphere. As part of the ongoing development, a new Industrial Development Zone with expanded port facilities has been built at Coega.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nLocated at the end of the picturesque Garden Route along the Cape coast, the city has beaches in and near it. The most popular swimming beaches include King's Beach and Hobie Beach.\nMany local historic attractions are linked by the Donkin Heritage Trail. These include the Campanile (bell tower), built in 1923 to commemorate the arrival of the 1820 Settlers and offering a viewpoint over the city; the city hall (1862); the Donkin Reserve park and monument; and the old stone Fort Frederick itself (1799). The CBD also boasts the towering Eastern Cape post office headquarters.\nRoute 67 is a walking trail consisting of 67 public artworks, symbolising 67 years which Nelson Mandela dedicated to the freedom of South Africa. The artwork is a celebration of South African culture and history and is scattered along the route as it starts from the Campanile, up the stairs to the Vuysile Mini Market Square and to the large South African flag at the Donkin Reserve. The artworks were created by local Eastern Cape artists.Other attractions include the gardens at St George's Park, the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum (formerly known as the King George VI Art Gallery), the museum and oceanography room at Humewood, and the new Boardwalk waterfront complex.\nThe wider area surrounding PE also features game viewing opportunities, including the Addo Elephant National Park, 72 kilometres (45 mi) to the north near the Zuurberg mountain range.\nPort Elizabeth is also a destination for whale watching with humpback whales sighted between June and August, and again between November and January, southern right whales sighted between July and November, and Bryde's whales sighted all year round.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe biggest sporting events in Port Elizabeth, is the annual Ironman triathlon and the Herald Cycle tour. The Tuna classic deep-sea fishing competition attracts anglers from all over the world.\nThe city has facilities catering for cricket, rugby union, athletics, association football, field hockey and many other sports. Its coastal location also makes it a base for many watersports.\nPort Elizabeth is the location of the St George's Park cricket ground, which holds test cricket matches. St George's Park is the oldest cricket ground in South Africa, and was the venue for the first Test match played outside of Australia or England, between South Africa and England on 12 and 13 March 1889. The Warriors, a franchise cricket team in South Africa, is based in Port Elizabeth. The stadium is also known for its band that entertains fans at the Proteas games.\nThe headquarters of the Southern Spears rugby franchise was in Port Elizabeth. The long-standing Eastern Province Rugby Union, now commonly known as the Eastern Province Elephants, formed the basis of the Spears franchise together with East London's Border Bulldogs. The remnants of the Spears were later reconstituted into the Southern Kings, also based in Port Elizabeth, which joined Super Rugby in 2013. The Southern Kings did not participate in Super Rugby in 2014 or 2015, and returned to Super Rugby in 2016, 2017, but were dropped for economical reasons by SARU. The team now competes in the Guinness Pro14. The Eastern Province Rugby Union play their home matches at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, built for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn December 2011, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium became the new home of the South Africa Sevens, the country's leg of the annual IRB Sevens World Series in rugby sevens. The event had previously been held in three other cities, most recently in George in the Western Cape from 2002 to 2010. As of 2015, is hosted annually in Cape Town, in the Western Cape.\nThe city's main football club is Chippa United, they currently use the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium as their home ground. Previous clubs to play in the country's top tier were Bay United, Michau Warriors, Port Elizabeth Blackpool, Hotspur F.C., Port Elizabeth City and Westview Apollon.\nThe Algoa Bay Yacht Club operates out of the Port of Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n== Government ==\nPort Elizabeth had its own municipality from 1843 to 2000.  Since then, it has formed part of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, and serves as the seat for the surrounding Cacadu District Municipality. It has a Magistrate's Court, a local seat of the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court, and a branch of the Labour Court. As a result of the presence of a High Court, several other related organs of state such as a Masters Office and a Director of Public Prosecutions are present in the city.\nAll Government (mostly provincial) departments maintain branches or other offices in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe Port Elizabeth municipality assumed a coat of arms on 9 January 1878.  The design, prepared by Bradbury Wilkinson and Company (of London), was a simplified version of the arms of Sir Rufane Donkin : Gules,  on a chevron Argent between two cinquefoils in chief and a bugle horn stringed in base Or, three buckles Sable;  a chief embattled Argent thereon an elephant statant proper.  The crest was a sailing ship, and the motto In meliora spera.\n(In layman's terms : a red shield displaying, from top to bottom, an elephant on a silver horizontal strip whose lower edge is embattled, two gold cinquefoils, a silver chevron bearing three black buckles, and a gold bugle horn.)\nEighty years later, in 1958, the council made slight changes to the arms, and had them granted by the College of Arms.  The changes consisted of adding two anchors to the chief of the shield, placing a red mural crown bearing three golden rings below the ship in the crest, and changing the motto to Tu meliora spera.  The arms were registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in 1959, and at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1986.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University Level ===\nThe Nelson Mandela University was formed by the amalgamation of the University of Port Elizabeth, Port Elizabeth Technikon, and the Port Elizabeth campus of Vista University. It is the largest university in the Eastern and Southern Cape, with around 29,000 students in seven faculties spread over seven campuses.\nRussell Road College and AFDA also have campuses in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== High School Level ===\nThe city has a number of top government-funded and private schools, although the abuse of substances seems to prevail in some schools due to a lack of drug prevention training on the part of the educational system, including Alexander Road High School, Collegiate Girls' High School, Victoria Park High School, Grey High School, Pearson High School, Woodridge College, Andrew Rabie High School and Lawson Brown High School.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nPort Elizabeth lies on the N2 road. To the west the road travels the Garden Route to George and Cape Town; to the east, the road runs through the Border Country through Makhanda, to East London then on to Durban, terminating in Ermelo in Mpumalanga. The R75 connects Port Elizabeth to the Karoo. The major routes within the city are numbered as metropolitan or M routes.\nThe city's main bus station is in Market Square. The public bus service is run by the Algoa Bus Company.  Between 1881 and 1948, there was a Port Elizabeth tramway network, powered initially by horses, and later by electricity.\nThe city is in the process of building a bus rapid transit system which was intended for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This has been a massive failure as local taxi associations have prevented the implementation. Port Elizabeth lacks a proper public transport system which has had a negative impact on the poorer residents of the city who are dependent on public transport. Construction of the bus rapid transit network has been suspended due to mismanagement which led to the project missing its May 2010 deadline. Calls for the project, which has left many parts of the city in a permanent state of construction, have been made recently, and it is expected that the government will make a decision on the matter soon.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nPort Elizabeth railway station is served by South Africa's rail network. Local commuter services are operated by Metrorail, while the Shosholoza Meyl long-distance passenger service links PE with Johannesburg via Bloemfontein where it is possible to connect with other long-distance routes.The Apple Express narrow-gauge tourist train to Avontuur operated from the separate station in Humewood Road near King's Beach. It departed regularly for Thornhill Village via Van Stadens River bridge, the highest narrow-gauge rail bridge in the world. The Apple Express was launched to provide a service to transport fresh produce and wood from the farms along the line to Avontuur. The line was completed in 1914 and the train delivered produce directly from the farms to ships in the Port Elizabeth Harbour. Due to modern transport methods such as containerisation, and refrigerated containers and trucks, the Apple Express and its services became redundant. Service has now ceased.\nIn preparation for the 2010 World Cup Soccer event the Humerail Station was extensively upgraded. Several disused narrow gauge goods wagons were scrapped and removed from the site, several buildings in the area have also been renovated and revamped.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nPort Elizabeth Airport (IATA airport code PLZ, ICAO airport code FAPE) serves the city for both passenger and cargo traffic. It is the fourth busiest airport in South Africa after O.R. Tambo International Airport, King Shaka International Airport in Durban, and Cape Town International Airport.\nInternational visitors to the city must currently fly to either Johannesburg, Cape Town or Durban, and then take a domestic flight to Port Elizabeth. An upgrade to the terminal building, completed in 2004, created the necessary facilities to handle international flights although none are scheduled as yet.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nPort Elizabeth has a harbour in Algoa Bay, and the construction of an additional international harbour at Coega has supported an increase in the size of the city's industries and the addition of new industries.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city has government-funded and private hospitals, including:\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nPort Elizabeth is served by a few radio outlets, namely Algoa FM, Umhlobo Wenene FM (radio broadcasting to the residents of Port Elizabeth, as well as the entire Eastern Cape, and Garden Route, and globally, online.)\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nThe Herald serves the English populace in terms of newspaper, on a daily basis. Die Burger serves the Afrikaans communities as well with a well established readership base.\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nThere are various social media news groups in Port Elizabeth, which is used at most as neighbourhood watch groups.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe SABC has a regional office in Port Elizabeth.  Bay TV is a free-to-air station established by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality that broadcasts 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. The station focusses on African story-telling and creating platforms for local content creators, and receives funding from local government and corporate donors.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n Beira, Mozambique\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nRed Location Museum\nList of heritage sites in Port Elizabeth\nFort Frederick, Eastern Cape\nBloemendal\nNational Monument\nVictorian era\nDonkin Heritage Trail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPort Elizabeth of Yore: The Defiance Campaign of 1952",

          "Route 67 is a great tribute to Nelson Mandela and provides insight into his impact on South Africa. But it is a steep climb and once you are one end you are far from the other. It needs planning. Also if you don't want to walk uphill you can start at the Donkin reserve and",

        "wiki": "The Donkin Heritage Trail is a 5 km self-guided walking trail along the old hill of central Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, South Africa. The Donkin Heritage Trail is named after the acting Governor of the Cape Colony, Rufane Shaw Donkin.The trail  links 51 places of historical interest and showcases settler history from as early as 1820. Sites include groups of double-storey semi-detached houses with prominent Victorian and Georgian features. These were erected shortly after the turn of the 20th century. It consists of five residences in Donkin Street, facing onto the Donkin Reserve. One of the residential homes is located at 14 Constitution Street and two others located at 8 and 10 Whitlock Street. The Donkin Street complex forms a notable row of terrace houses, and is one of the city's most prominent landmarks. Many of the landmarks have been declared national monuments.\n\n\n== Places on the Donkin Heritage Trail ==\n\n\n=== Main Library ===\nThe Main Library building with Victorian Gothic architecture, is on the corner of Market Square.\n\n\n=== Queen Victoria Statue ===\nA marble statue of Queen Victoria stands at the entrance of the library.\n\n\n=== Market Square ===\nThe trail begins at this site, the centrepiece of the Market Square is the City Hall. There is a replica of the Diaz Cross, commemorating the first European to sail into Algoa Bay in 1488.\n\n\n=== City Hall ===\nThe City Hall is central to the Market square and dates back to 1858.\n\n\n=== Prester John Memorial ===\nThe Prester John Memorial is a Coptic Cross with two figures inside it. It commemorates the Portuguese explorers who discovered South Africa as well as the story of a far older mythical figure named Prester John. Between the 12th and 18th centuries Prester John was believed to have been an early Christian King and one of the descendants of the Three Magi of Christian belief. He was the \u2018patron\u2019 of Christian exploration of the world and is seen as \u2018a symbol to European Christians of the Church\u2019s universality, transcending culture and geography to encompass all humanity\u2019 and therefore a figurehead for Portuguese sailors and explorers.\n\n\n=== Campanile ===\nThe Campanile is a 120-foot bell tower, which was built in the 1920s to commemorate the 1820 Settlers. The first proposal for a memorial tower to commemorate the landing of the British Settlers of 1820, was made in 1904 by the Reverend Alfred E Hall, a minister of the Queen Street Baptist Church. On 9 April 1921, the foundation stone of the Campanile was laid by H R H Prince Arthur of Connaught, governor of the Union of South Africa. On 10 March 1922, the design for the Campanile was approved  and the contract for building the structure was subsequently awarded on 18 March 1922 to a local firm of builders, Harris and Harrower Limited. The tender was worth \u00a36 150. It took approximately 18 months to complete the campanile. The dressed stone, used to construct the base, was taken from some of the oldest buildings in the city and the arched main doorway was built of stone quarried in Grahamstown. The tower is made of brick and reinforced with concrete. Each brick went through a quality test before being used. The structure, both base and belfry, is made of local brick faced with smooth, red Grahamstown bricks. The roof tiles were also obtained from Grahamstown.\nArchitecturally, the Campanile is well-proportioned, lofty and slender and simple. The structure is reminiscent of the famous St Mark's Campanile in Venice, which is 320 feet high. The Campanile in Port Elizabeth is 170 feet high from ground level to the tip of the pyramid roof. The area of the structure at the base is 23 feet square, its foundation resting upon sea-worn rock. The windows at different floor levels are fitted with decorative precast concrete grilles and the belfry. There are eight floors within the tower and to reach the observation floor, which is approximately 136 feet above the floor level of the reception area, the visitor has to climb 204 steps. The frieze of the reception area is artistically inscribed with brief details of the events connected with the erection of the Campanile.\nThe tower was erected at a final cost of \u00a35 940, but there was neither clock nor bells for the proposed carillon, so that fund-raising was started for that purpose. The largest bell in the carillon is about 6 feet in diameter and weighs between three and four tons. The bells were hoisted into position in the belfry during July 1936 and the first recital on the carillon was given on 9 September by Lionel Field, Mus Bac, ARCM.\nSix of the bells were sponsored by descendants of 1820 Settlers as a tribute to their forebears, or by others who wished to honour their memory. Details are embossed on each of the 23 bells which are engraved on a brass plaque affixed to a wall in the reception area of the Campanile.\nBells are rung from the campanile three times a day. The 204-step spiral staircase leads to views over Algoa Bay. The Campanile is partially overshadowed by the Settler's Freeway, however, it remains a focal point of the city's built environment.\n\n\n=== Railway Station ===\nThe Port Elizabeth railway station, located north of the Campanile, and the Railway Station building existed since 1875, when the first line was constructed to Uitenhage approximately 40 Kilometres away.

The fort was built at the mouth of the Baakens River in 1799 in order to defend against any invasion of French troops during the Napoleonic Wars. The French troops never invaded and the cannons were never fired. The cannons are still located in the area.\n\n\n=== Port Elizabeth/St George's Club ===\nSt George's Park is the oldest park in Port Elizabeth and is within walking distance of the city centre.

The pond has  since been filled in and is used as a playground for children. Trinder was a family name of the merchants Joseph and William Smith who owned property nearby.\n\n\n=== Hillside House ===\nIn 1824, the property was  granted to George Daniel Diesel . The building was erected after that date and is richly decorated with a number of Victorian architectural elements.

          "WATCH OUT we were told to get parking tickets and leaded into scam at an ATM, lost our bank passes... The people doing it looked like officals, wore badges. When approached I advise you to get out of the place asap!",
          "If you can hire a guide, do it because there are not many signa explaining many things you see. Go up the stairs in the lighthouse. It is worth the view!!!",

          "Agree with all excellent reviews of lighthouse. This review is a warning: Yesterday we visited the lighthouse and had a pleasant visit. We left for a short while and then returned to eat our lunch on the grass. I was approached by an officious looking man with a name badge that",
          "We did not know what to expect when visiting the Donkin Reserve. You can even stop by when it is closed. The lighthouse is beautiful and the mosaic outside colorful and a great photo op. There is a Mandela Art Piece which is simply WONDERFUL. Stop by regardless of opening",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Donkin Reserve. 84 steps up the old lighthouse is a must, for fantastic views of Port Elizabeth. The entire premises is packed with interesting things to see, from the pyramid built in honour of Elizabeth, after whom the city was named, late wife of",
          "We walked to the Donkin Reserve after eating lunch at the Stage Door. I wasn't sure of the area as it looked kind of dicey, but it was okay. The people manning the visitors centre were friendly and knew their area attractions. It was very windy at the Donkin Reserve as it's",

          "The art that forms part of the route 67 is wonderful, and I enjoyed climbing up the lighthouse to see views over the city. Note that the stairs in the lighthouse are very steep (almost ladders) though so not suitable for those with mobility issues or fear of heights.",
          "We were looking for the information office at the Donkin and were pleasantly surprised with the other artworks around the place. The pyramid structure has a great little romantic story of how it was built and why. A good place to visit for a lunch break or find out more on",

          "As mentioned in some of the other reviews security is a problem here, which is a pity as it is an interesting place to visit. Apart from giving one some idea as to the naming of Port Elizabeth there are also visual sights to enjoy. Apart from the lighthouse and pyramid there is",

          "The place is nice and it has a beautiful view, but it\u2019s not safe to be there. Good to take some creative pictures. The visit doesn\u2019t take longer than 20min.",
          "My husband and I took a walk to the Donkin Reserve to see the pyramid and lighthouse. The mosaic on the floor is worth taking the time to look properly at and not just glance. I think it was 10rand to go up the lighthouse which I would recommend. It\u2019s not the easiest to climb",
          "At least something to do in PE. You can also follow some kind of art path. It is possible to go up the lighthouse for 10 Rand were you have a very nice over the ocean and PE. The mosaik is to be seen very nicely from up there as well.",
          "My visit was not very recent but would say the maintenance of the gardens and indigenous plants is poor, security could be risky, so dont carry passports cameras money etc openly, and move around in groups larger than two if possible, or when the area is busy. It is",

          "Lived in PE for many years during its golden years. Nowadays the historic centre of Port Elizabeth is like so many other cities in Africa, somewhat messy and dangerous. Great to visit, but do it in the middle of the afternoon when people are around. Night time--don't go there.",
          "Certainly worth a visit but quite frankly the area has seen better days as it is really just above central Port Elizabeth. It does however afford nice views. Parking is easy and whilst walking on the grassy area of the Reserve should be fine I would caution against venturing",
          "Very neat and clean, with families, tourists and young people hanging out. The tourist centre is right next to the lighthouse.",
          "There is a good view above the city and a lot of monuments and memories about south african history in the square, however it is not well maintained. Also some of the old-beautiful buildings around seem to be abandoned.",

          "The Donkin Reserve is a history rich, cultural attraction in the heart of PE. The views are stunning and the metro seem to have made some effort in making this a genuine tourist attraction. Safety in this area is still a concern, however I did see some guards walking around",
          "We had a short stop here as part of our day tour but it was long enough to take in the art sculptures, the pyramid and lighthouse, the tall flag pole with the biggest flag in South Africa and the lovely mosaic. A very peaceful environment and if you are feeling energetic, pay to",

          "Worth a vist to see the big flag and if game for the high climb up into the light house the veiw is a great reward. Just not recommended for persons with a fear of hights, however there is space to have a seat and wait for the rest of the adventurers climbing up.",
          "We had some time to kill awaiting flight and was advised to come here. Parking free nearby too. You can get map of a 2hr walk around donkin from the lighthouse tourist info centre for 40rand. We didnt have time to do so walked around the lighthouse and art work nearby.",

          "Indeed the Donkin Reserve is one of the best treasures of PE. I had such a great time on a Saturday afternoon with my little sister, just hanging out in the beautiful park and its surroundings. One of the most interesting aspects to it is that you experience a severe sense of",
          "This place has the best view of Port Elizabeth and it has so much culture. The Donkin Reserve is the best place to walk around and to relax. You can either sit on the grass and look at the National flag or go to the tower and climb to the top. The best time to be here is for the",

          "Having lived in PE for 23 years you'd think I'd have already been there and done that. Not the case. Came for a quick visit with friends from Plett and was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful views of town and the Campanile from the top.",
          "Every day people travel around Port Elizabeth and you cant go past the memorial without popping round.The views from there of the bay are beautiful and if you can take the short tour round.",
          "The Donkin reserve is located on Port Elizabeth heart and worths a visit. It is a very calm and peaceful place, floor is full filled with mosaics that tells the story of the country. Here are a lighthouse that can be visit and with a lot of information and we could appreciate",
          "We went on the Donkin and read the memorial plaque that was placed by a caring husband for his wife. You need to see this for yourself ! A climb up the lighthouse was a struggle but well worth it",

          "There was a time that this was not a safe spot to visit. one would often get harassed by drug dealers. I decided to try it again. what a change. well laid out paths, plenty of fellow visitors, even more Tourist Ambassadors walking around. It offers excellent views of the city",

          "Great view + interesting cut out metal art that becomes spectacular on a cloudy day. Because of it being on a steep hill recommend older people to enter from the top. For safety I suggest visiting between 9am & 4pm while it is busy,",
          "Took our sister-and-brother-in-law from Australia for a city walk around, was so great to see the place had been cleaned up so nicely and felt safe walking around which is a huge plus for visitors. The Madiba storyline - interesting, the mosaic art - well done and of course",
          "Truly the most educational monument in Port Elizabeth. My Grandchild loved it when he visited The Donkin Reserve on a historical tour of Port Elizabeth.",
          "We were only in Port Elizabeth overnight, so googled things to do; this came out top. It was an incredibly windy day, so much so that the military were having a huge fight trying to lower the flag for safe keeping! We visited the lighthouse and although the view from the top",
          "This was a memorable walk nobody should miss The art was amazing and this is a reserve not to be visited without a good camera.",

          "Wonderful old history of PE as you get into the city centre and 67 Mandela art works, it's like a park with coffee shop surrounded by old hotels and the Opera house plus galleries, places of interest. Beautiful views and no charge",
          "After living for five years in Port Elizabeth and returning to this city many times since we returned to Europe we always experience the Donkin as the place where it all started in 1820 when the Settlers arrived from the UK. Also the surrounding Victorian houses time you back to",

          "One truly needs to visit the reserve and marvel at the different artworks on the Route 67 heritage route. The reserve consists of the gardens, the lighthouse and a 10-meter high memorial pyramid. The pyramid was erected by Sir Rufane Donkin in memory of his late wife Elizabeth,",
          "The Donkin Reserve went through a neglected phase during the 80's and 90's, where not much attention was paid to the site, nor tourists' safety. Urban blight too, with a lack of proper maintenance, saw the Reserve littered, unkept and home to vagrants. I was so pleased to note",
          "This place is a hidden gem. There are lots of beautiful public artworks on display. The Lighthouse, the Pyramid and the metal sculptures are fantastic. In addition, you will find a wonderful coffee shop and a stunning view of the city.",

          "Take some time to stop by this park. Lots of history here. Beautiful artwork. I recommend walking around the metal sculpture.",
          "As part of the history of Port Elizabeth, this is an imperative and compulsory stop when travelling in and around the city. Not only is the view great, the history of the area is important in understanding its relevance.",
          "it was a very relaxing afternoon. me and my family had a lot of fun. would go again in the near future.",
          "So glad we visited it this time. Beautiful views, and with the celebration of Nelson Mandela's life in art just a stone's throw away it was a real trat. I find the area to be safe, with many visitors during the dag. There are very historic buildings close by. Will be back.",
          "This area within the heart of Port Elizabeth is an interesting and beautiful urban space. The reserve commemorates Elizabeth Donkin, for whom the city is named. There are also contemporary art pieces celebrating Nelson Mandela. There is a park and the area is safe during the day",
          "The Donkin Reserve is a place steeped in history, memory and love as well as dedication of the People of South Africa to their ideals. It is also a nice view point on the port and the City. The Route 67 starts nearby. Several historic buildings are also near there. A park garden",
          "The Donkin Reserve truly is one of Port Elizabeth's iconic attractions. A great combination between old and new with the historic lighthouse and pyramid standing side by side with the Route 67 public art pieces. The view from the lighthouse must be one of the best in the city.",
          "You don't need that much time here but it is well worth the visit to see the memorial pyramid to Elizabeth Donkin in whose honour the city was named. Alongside to pyramid is the original lighthouse, and the other way there is a very very tall flagpole. We were told that an",
          "Since my last review, I've visited the Donkin Reserve several times and recently had a young Argentinian visitor who wasn't really interested in the beaches...he wanted history and buildings! Awesome! So we did a lot of the Rooute 67 and happily, it was a weekday when the Donkin",
          "It is so nice to wander around this monument and read up on the attraction . It is a good condition and is very accessible . It is an iconic place in PE and should be visited",
          "One of the few attractions PE has on offer, and worth the visit. Its not too far from the beach and hotels, stop by if you can",
          "The Donkin Reserve is a very well kept area of Port Elizabeth. It can be easily identified by the tall flag pole and flag. However the place has limited shade and can be unbearable hot for some visitors. However a low light time of the day, the reserve is quite a treasure to",
          "High over the city this vantage point, which also boasts the highest flag-pole in the Southern hemisphere, has a pleasant tea-shop and a visitor information centre.",
          "We made a brief visit to Donkin Reserve during our visit to Port Elizabeth. The sculpture of Nelson Mandela and other people is a good photo opportunity. Other interesting public art within the reserve includes the pyramid and different forms of street arm. The area is exposed",
          "Nice to spend time looking at all the Art Works on display . Unfortunately it is not safe to be on your own here as there is a criminal element around this area. Some lovely photo opportunites",
          "The Donkin Reserve area has been upgraded and has a beautiful historical walk. Great view of the city and the harbour. Take a picture with Mandela art work and feel the history of South Africa. Have a meal or coffee across the road. Would be great if more was done to attract",
          "This is a bit of a tricky review because of my personal history with the place... Now it is an interesting place to visit and if it's your first time in PE, it is a must. Unfortunately it is not very well 'cared for' but you can get a sense of the history by reading and",
          "I recently visited the Donkin Reserve and it was very nice the way it was set out overlooking the Port Elizabeth Bay Area. The Donkin also has a coffee shop and they have the best cuppacino in town i reckon. There is also a trail which leads down to the city which I did not take",

Named after Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, commander-in-chief of the British Army, it was built by troops sent to Algoa Bay to prevent a possible landing of French troops, under Napoleon to assist the Graaff-Reinet rebels during the Napoleonic wars, this event is often regarded to be the beginning of the British rule in the Cape Colony.The \"landing with fresh water\", as Algoa Bay was referred to, sits at the mouth of the Baakens River, the bay stretches from the Baaken river to the outskirts of modern-day Port Elizabeth. When the 1820 Settlers arrived in Port Elizabeth, the fort was already ancient and had never fired a shot from its guns and still has not.The fort contains several key design features namely: the powder magazine, the blockhouse (which has lost its timber upper storey) and its original armaments consisted of two 8-pounder guns and one 5.5 inch Howitzer and the museum collection now also contains a varied selection of muzzle-loaders dating from the later part of the eighteenth century.Captain Francis Evatt, Commandant of Fort Frederick between 1817 and 1847 is buried on the Donkin reserve which Fort Frederick forms a part of. Captain Evatt played an important role in overseeing the arrivals of the Settlers in 1820.Port Elizabeth sprang up around the fort.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nOpening times are daily, from sunrise to sunset and the admission is free.\nThe fort is reportedly haunted by the ghosts of a Shakespeare play.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Castles and Fortifications in South Africa\nPort Elizabeth\nCape colony\nBattle of Blaauwberg\nInvasion of the Cape Colony (1795)\nBritish rule in South Africa\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The family decided to take the kids here over the weekend because its been a long time since we visited the park. The guy at the entrance gate is very good at his job and that's about where it all ended. We drove through the bush path seeing nothing until we came close to the",
          "Nobody should support this place! They have ignored all negative press coverage of their disgusting activities.",
          "The wildlife, predators and animals were beautiful to see. The view is great. The walk was a little unsteady and could ber repaired. I am happy to see the lions have a large area to live and appeared healthy.",
          "We drove in here not knowing what to expect. After driving over the track we got to the area where the lions and tigers were. They were each fenced off in pairs in very small paddocks with not much going on in the hot sun. They all looked terribly sad. I don\u2019t understand why",
          "One of the receptionists at the place we were staying in Port Elizabeth told us about the park. Firstly I was a bit apprehensive about driving around the park on arrival at the gate after a lot of rain in the hire car but we got round. Firstly It's not a game reserve - yes it",
          "I had one of the greatest experiences when encountering with the lion cubs. I even got to feed one of them with a milk bottle. I saw other types of animals as well. They do look after their wildlife very well. I actually travelled to this destination in December 2005.",
          "This is a stunning Lion park and the animals are exquisite. We always took our son there when he was little and it was such a privilege to take our little granddaughter to the same park 32 years later.",
          "The park are excellent and well maintained clean and seeing the big cats so close really was the highlight",
          "One Sunday morning on our way to PE we decided to turn in at the Lion Park. Entrance fee compared to other Lion Parks is fairly reasonable. The drive through the park would probably take about 15-20 min or so. There's not much animals to see though, besides the odd buck, zebra",
          "Not sign posted very well but a nice few hours out in nice weather quite a long ride out from PE. The entry price was very good the car drive round was a bit Scary as we didn't have a 4x4. Got nice and close to the lions but not the tigers. The highlight was the closeness of the",
          "It's a nice way to pass a day with family and affordable and can see plenty different animals. Its a way to chill out.",
          "first it is expensive to go in by the gate secondly there is not much to see. the cages of the lions are very stincky i expected so much more was very dissapointed it is a far end out of port elizabeth on the kragga kamma road towards seaview the restuarant was ok but not up to",
          "People say the eyes are the windows to the soul...If that is true, then these animals are pretty much dead inside. The lions are fed every Sunday, however, it is really sad to watch such amazing animals reduced to cheap attractions. Most of the cats here are kept in small",
          "Visited the Lion park while spending a few days in Port Elizabeth. Not really much to see though, as lions were far back in their cages and were really lazy. was a very hot day too.",
          "Excellent place to go for a few hours. Really enjoyed it and the staff were incredibly good. Nice little restaurant to finish with as well. Think the key thing here is you can mange what you want to do within their environment and so are not dependent on other people.",
          "Been to the park four years ago, it was then the highlight of our trip, returned in December 2017 only to discover that their was no maintenance of the place. The wooden structures near the cafe where u can walk to see the rather unpopulated enclosures from above shook and",
          "This was the highlight of PE for us. So close up to lions. Go at 12pm for feeding, truly amazing. Lots of other animals. Well maintained. Must Go.",
          "The giraffes were infested with ticks .. this is a sign of disease! ticks transmit a lethal disease to the animal. I asked the manager why they were in that state and he said that it was normal and that the immune system controlled them. In the other park Kragga Kamma I noticed",
          "Nice idea to keep the toddlers busy but not best idea for older children and adults. The animals are in a good condition and very relaxed therefore you can drive very close to them. The lions and tigers are huge and well looked after. I am just concerned about the wire",
          "In fact beside one giraffe and few zebras we didn't see any animals in this parks. Lions and tigers were in cages. From locals we heard later that they are doing can breeding for trophies. They are much better game parks in the area.",
          "There were some nice animal including giraffes, although we were highly disappointed by the disgusting attitude of the abrupt cafe staff. We were impolitely instructed to leave at 4:30pm and denied any refreshments by an obnoxious staff member. I would recommend this place, if",
          "Was a nice adventure with our toddler to see all the bucks and giraffe on our drive to the lions. Lots of lions really amazing and tigers- great to see. Then by the restuarant the naughty monkeys and the wild cats were amazing, some of the cats were really after my little ones",
          "I would recommend this to ANYONE. Was really a awesome experience. A variety of animals seen, place is well looked after and still cant believe how affordable it is",
          "I had a very lovely day here and got close up with lots of animals. Nice luch in the treetops. Friendly and informative staff. Good value overall.",
          "As stated in other reviews, the Lion Park could use a little help in the organization department. The only employee or volunteer we saw the entire time was the guard at the gate. We were left driving around and looking at things by ourselves. Not a problem since it is a one lane",
          "We visited on a cool overcast day, the Tigers were very active and gave all great opportunities for photographs. The lion were roaring and growling which was a great treat for the kids. Afterwards we had went up to the Restaurant for coffee, cold drink and snacks. The kids",
          "Found it to be very confusing and not well put together, it's expensive for what you get. Water in animals cages looked old, dirty and disgusting.",
          "So the Game Park is not to be blamed for the weather, cold and raining, typical Easter Weekend! The drive to the park is quick, just 10 minutes out of town and the park itself is lovely, with the rains a bit greener than I was expecting The Lions and Tigers (yes Tigers) are",
          "the game park has a lot of lions, tigers, and many big cats. They are caged in wide areas. You will see them behind wires. No direct contact or risky encounters.",
          "We took friends from overseas there, to show them the white lions. The number of lions at the park have decreased dramatically since our last visit, and while our guests enjoyed the outing, we as locals left a little disappointed. There are many other animals to see other",
          "The animals looked well kept and it was nice to drive amoung the animals and see them up close. It was an easy drive and def value for money",
          "We had such a lovely day at the Lion Park. They have lots of animals, not just lions and it was to get out into the open and enjoy these beautiful wild animals. Food is a bit rubbish and expensive but everything else was fab - hence the 4 - if we went just to eat, i wouldnt go",
          "Enjoyed the nature and to look out for the lions. Exciting and at times risky. Keep your distance. Listen and read the pamphlets.",
          "been here a few times but it seems like the park is deteriorating in some way. the lions and tigers are beautiful - massive creatures, awesome to here them roar (when the opportunity strikes) - the one enclosure that allowed us to drive through the open space with the lions is",
          "I have been here about 4 times and love it every time! Thor is an albino lion that you must see! He is huge!",
          "Went out to see the lions at seaveiw. A great adventure. Sometimes a little to close for comfort and scary to walk around with only a fence to divide you from them.",
          "We took a visitor from overseas to this park. Handling the cubs is a big attraction though we feel that it's unfair to make wild animals too familiar with humans, as it could be a possibility of making them tame enough for canned hunting.",
          "We had a great day out here, driving though with lions walking around the car was something else. The petting area was brilliant. Never thought I'd get to play with lion cubs, definitely recommend this. Then getting in with the tigers was amazing",
          "nice place - many wild animals to see up close. but do not forget the little farm at the bottom for the kids",
          "This is a great little safari adventure where you get to see a lot in a short space of time. Having grown up in PE we frequented this place but after moving away for many years I could not wait to show our kids around, and the Seaview Lion Park was one of the highlights. Great",
          "We spent much of a morning at the park. Entry is very affordable and guy at the gate super friendly. We saw lots of beautiful animals really close up including giraffe, wildebeest, various buck and big cats. Lions and tigers are in smaller enclosures and are incredible to see up",
          "An amazing outing, take your time. There is alot of game to see when you enter the park, so drive slowly and keep your eyes peeled. The lions get fed at 12 noon on a Sunday and is something to see. They also have tigers, Lynx, Zebra, Giraffe, Leopard and other wildlife to see.",
          "You know when you drive in and see no animals...you get that sinking feeling. Well we came around the bend and voila! Breathtaking and amazing. Seeing the animals in their natural and indigenous environment just warms me through. The animals remain in their wild status. The",
          "What a great day we had saw hidde buck in the woods and enjoyed the lions and tigers napping, had a cola and enjoyed the ocean view, its a great place truely",
          "Amazing experience to be amoung the lions and tigers. This lion park offers amazing views and a unique tree top view of various predetors within the park. There is lots to see and experince in the most amazing scenic area of South Africa.",
          "This is a beautiful place to go for a short outing. See and hopefully hear the lions all in the smell of the fresh ocean in the back ground.",
          "I have been to Seaview many times as a child and since we were in town again, I took my daughter (12), 86 year old dad and 2 nieces (aged 15 and 10) to see the lions. It was okay. Not as I remembered it as a child, but okay. The kids loved it though. Outside the restaurant",
          "I took my 90 year old mother in law who is on holiday with us to Seaview Lion Park. The man at the gate was very friendly and told us a pipe had burst which was why the entrance was flooded and the municipality were dealing with it! We thoroughly enjoyed watching the white lions",
          "Amazing place to go with family and children. Smaller than safari and easier to see animals. Lions and tigers are under the fence",
          "This place was lovely and quiet, well kept but quite small. The Lions are as they would be in a Zoo in the UK, there is a walkway over other animals which I thought was really good. The view is spectacular at the top. Worth and visit and not expensive.",
          "Very close to the city. Roads are good. We saw zebras , lions , various types of buck. The highlight was going there during feeding time for lions at noon.The lions are well taken care of and can view them at close range.",
          "We have been three times and love it every time. The park is relatively small but there are plenty of animals in their natural habitat. The big cats are in enclosures though but are still well looked after. The best thing is the view from outside the restaurant. Amazing views of",
          "The game reserve is quite small. The lion area is a zoo. Just so you know. The view from the top is quite cool. In general, I would recommend to go to the cheaper Kragga Kamma game reserve close by!",
          "It has some spectacular animals however it is a shame how they are all in small enclosures! I don't think it is anything special and wouldn't go out of my way to visit again.",
          "Apart from a few lions locked up and some zebra and giraffe wondering around, there was not much else to see. This is a far cry from how great this place used to be. Very very sad. I won't be going back.",
          "I was here three years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Spent hours. This time, however, I found it run down. The walkways need a lot of maintenance. They sway back and forth as you walk and we found it unnerving. Very few animals to see. The 4 lions in the large",
          "This site is mainly a breeding area for lions to repopulate other parks. I have visited this park many times over the years and sadly it has declined in popularity. You used to be able to have experiences with the large cats but this has now gone. You are able to drive around",
          "It's more a zoo than a park, but still nice animals to see. The park itselfs needs an update, and staff could be more friendly. The tigers are special I guess?",
          "Maybe it's just me! I've never seen such a scraggly, sad place that feeds off tourists and guests with \"lies\" about what they are doing there! Such a place should be closed down and the sad animals put into better care! Never again!",
          "Seeing blesbok, giraffe, wildebeest grazing as you drive through the park. The highlight being the cats, lions, tigers and to top it off a black leopard. My advice to someone wishing to visit is to call and enquirer what time they feed the lions. We arrived and had about 20",
          "A self drive at Seaview lion park is a great way of spending the day with family or friends. We enjoyed the animals and the ocean view is just so beautiful...",
          "Definitely an experience getting so close to the animals. Unfortunately when we went the park didn't have any baby lions to play with, Overall I think it's definitely worth a visit when you're in PE but it's not exactly an authentic safari experience. Would recommend to anyone",
          "It was a pleasant experience. We enjoyed seeing the cats and other animals at the park. Regrettably there were no cubs",
          "This is nothing but a Lion zoo now. If you like seeing Lions and Tigers in a zoo, that's the place for it. I went to this Park 4 years ago and its interesting point was that you could interact with the Lions, but now they don't have any interaction anymore. When I asked the guy",
          "On our way back from Pumba reserve. We were told that this was a great stop off for a couple of hours before boarding our flight to Cape Town. We had been enthralled with Pumba and although the lions at Seaview were in Large cages it gave us a change to walk instead the Lions",
          "The park used to be lovely, but now everything is so small. There are hardly any animals to see and the cages that the Lions are in are terribly small. To top it off when they were fed you could smell that the meat was rotten",
          "I enjoyed this place. A nice area to have food and you see real animals, in particular lions who want to eat you.",
          "The park is not so bigand still I did not see to many animals. It was a cold and rainy day so maybe this is why, they were all hiding. The lion's and tiger's where magnificent I was impressed.",
          "I have visited the park previously, and I was highly disappointed this time as I came to the park for a Sunday public feeding. Before, the park has been absolutely wonderful with a great amount of items to view such as tigers, lions, and smaller animals in close view by the",
          "Great place for a Sunday afternoon drive with a great view. Animals all around you. Not the biggest variety but a good few lions, tigers and lots of buck, giraffes, zebra. And the touch the animals ... superb for people with kids.",
          "If lions are something you are interested in then the Lion Park is the place to go visit, you will not be disappointed!",
          "We found the place on the return trip from Maitlands and decided to stop. Being Kruger Park fans, we set ourselves up for disappointment. Not too much to see - giraffe and zebra - but the caracel and the other caged cats were interesting but so sad that they have to be caged in",
          "Loved being up close with the lion cubs. Great place and an experience I won't forget. Staff were very friendly and provided so much information.",
          "We went to Seaview Lion Park last year 2014 and what an experience. Animals well looked after overall a memorable experience. Children love it!! Will go there again.",
          "We visit the Lion Park with friends. We ate lunch. Was good. Many different lions and other animals near the restaurant. First time ever that we as family heart the lions calling each other. It was the most greatest sound ever. The rangers team look very good after the",
          "We were impressed with the new road, so access to the park is much better, but we were very dissapointed with the overall experience. They used to have animals outside in enclosures as well as cubs in the restaurant area. Sundays you could watch the lions being fed.....we had",
          "I visited this place to watch an animal sanctuary that Rehabilitate predators, insted i had to watch them in small cages. after seeing these animals in the wild (kruger park) it was really sad for me to watch\u2026 Also it was kind of empty with no guids arround, just walking around",
          "What a great few hours spent here with my young daughter. On arrival you have a short game drive (in your own car) and can see zebra, giraffe and buck very close to the car. We headed straight up to the restaurant / sanctuary area and had a look there seeing meerkats, a black",
          "So close to the city of Port Elizabeth and yet you feel like you're out \"in the bush\". Had a lovely day out and took the pleasure in meeting the baby hyena, twin tiger cubs and a sleeping lioness while there. Being so close to the giraffe while driving around makes one feel so a",
          "it was a gr8 experience bcaus 2 c da wild animals here infront of u damn it was exciting n da route let u feel tht u part of da wild.if u hve time visit this place.",
          "Such great experience! I took 12 students there, mostly teenagers, and everybody loved it. Unfortunately, the weather was really horrible, flooding, so we couldn't have access everywhere ( not much info available before the visit). A must see! U can tahe really good pics close",
          "Had a really enjoyable visit, got very close to Giraffes, and some buck. Always feel a bit sorry when seeing cats in enclosures though.",
          "All animals look well kept. Large clean enclosures, Staff are very laid back Great chance to be able to get close to these Great animals.",
          "The park is just outside PE and is accessible with any car, no need for 4x4. One can really take a slow drive through and after each corner one can be surprised by some sort of animals, boks, zebras, giraffes,... Towards the end one reaches the enclosures with lions. I guess it",
          "It was really nice and relaxing great drive in and seeing wild life was great felt like a game drive. The lions did look dead at the time I went and was looking forward to playing with cabs but the were no cabs at the time I went would advice to call in advance but would have",
          "Great experience and close to the main town. You can smell the sea breeze mingled with the blackwattle while you tour or enjoy a refreshment at the restaurant. Friendlies staff and people in South Africa, garanteed. Nice half day excurtion, go now.",
          "Loved the view from the high ground. Looks good but didn't see many animals as I expected and for some reason, it didn't look so lively. But for the place it offered a nice calm atmosphere to relax.",
          "This place was awesome. We loved driving through and had giraffes come right up to our windows. The zebras were so close we could touch them plus all type of boks. The lion enclosure was pretty cool especially if you go at feeding time. It looks like skinny chicken wire",
          "Shame that all animals were slightly quarantined - some type of potential danger could be passed onto the animals so no lion cub petting. The owener and maanger of the palce was a demon with his snakles - quite happy to get them out and let you photograph and touch them. great",
          "Came to Seaview to see the animals, but most of all, interact with them in the petting zoo! Lots of fun playing with the animals - if you are in the area it is definitely worth the experience. It's not cheap, but the staff there are very open to giving you more than enough time",
          "We visited the lion park and got lots to see, unfortunately they did not have any cubs to interact with. You need to phone and check before visiting if you would like to interact with the cubs! They have volunteers working at the centre and they interact with the animals! This",
          "It was a bit sad watching the lions and tigers in a very limmited space to move around. We were told there was a virus within the animals in the park so we couldn\u00b4t touch any of them. There are also giraffes in the reserve and they get very close to the car so you can take a",
          "Small private game reserve with a variety of animals but mostly lions. You may interact with the cubs (your decision whether this is a good idea, for the lions, or not...lets hope the lions end up in game preserves). Small restaurant and gift shop. Worth a stop if you're in",
          "this private Lion Park was really for us worth taking the time on a Sunday to drive through and to see how the lions was fed. Had my brothers little boys with me and they was amazed by the giraffe standing still only a few metres from our car chewing away on lunch. Very nice",
          "We enjoyed our visit to Seaview Lion Park, you are able to see the lions & tigers close up as well the giraffes & other animals. The staff & volunteers were really helpful & spoke to us about the animals we were looking at. Everyone was happy & welcoming. We also did the wild",
          "I am surprised to read the review by imtrigirl - she obviously hit a bad day ! We have visited this venue on a few occasions - you can drive through the one lion enclosure and sure, the lions are lazy, but sometimes inquisitive enough that they jump up against your car, which",
          "What a waste of time and cab fare! Arriving, there wasn't even anyone to direct me what to do. So I just walked around \"watching\" sleeping lions in big cages. I could see this at a zoo. Don't even bother going! Super waste of time!",
          "excellent game park with so many different lions and other animals to see - held baby tiger which was amazing will def return",
          "We recently holidayed in Port Elizabeth and after having debated what to do, we thought it may be nice to take the children to the park. We saw plenty of young giraffes and some buck and then parked our vehicles to the enclosure where the tiger is kept and where the lions are.",
          "I return to SA every 3 years and each time I bring my family back to good old Port Elizabeth (bod of my favourite cities). We visit the park every time we come back to PE. I was somewhat dismayed to see the astronomical increase in gate fees and then the one on one animal",
          "The park starts with a game drive through giraffe and other bok. Then you can park and walk through the predator camp. Then into the restaurant area where you can walk a boardwalk through the interaction area. You can purchase different interactions with tiger cubs, lion cubs,",
          "Its a zoo, no one explain why the animals are there, what are the goal of the place.. terrible. you can take pictures with baby animals, but each one has different price, I felt like buying clothes... The only good things is there you can see a lot of giraffes near the parking",
          "We went there for a family day, basically there is nothing todo, the braai and picnic facilities are not up to scratch, and its appalling to see how small the cages were that these animals were in, disgusted!!!!",
          "Not too brilliant. Not many animals. Lions are good though. Expensive for what you see. Lions well looked after and you can drive into where some of them are.",
          "We stayed there for 2 weeks and volunteered there with the animals. It was an amazing experience which I recommend anyone to try it.",
          "Seaview is a beautiful place to visit if you love lions like I do. I was able to take some great photos of lions. I'd heard you can go in with the lions and interact with them and cuddle the babies. It was one of the greatest disappointments of my life when I found there were no",
          "High entrance fee with all roads closed off for entrance. No animals except a few antelope. Few fat lions. Agree animals sold off for hunting. Where have all last year's cubs gone? Two Tiger missing also. Cat walk unsafe. Cages all empty. Very unpleasant experience. African Dawn",
          "nothing special, but fighting a great cause. The cuddleable baby animals were to big for our 10 year old. Only animals the be touched were the caracals for roughly 75 rand for 5 minutes.",
          "As a sanctuary for animals from zoos etc, you will always be sure to see a variety of different animals here. Our fav was the interactive time with a white lion cub and white Bengal tiger cub.. Only 7 to 9 months old, they are still quite frightening.",
          "I personally volunteered here for a few weeks back in June, and would love to go again if not for the cost of flights there from the US. Being able to be behind the scenes is such a different experience than just walking along the boardwalk or driving through the park. I think",
          "This so called game park is in fact more like a zoo. Animals are kept in fenced camps with virtually no natural habitat. They also have Tigers which are not indemic to South Africa and must surely suffer with our climate.",
          "The lions just lying in their cages with no stimulation, so so sad. Lions are social animals living in families, but here you see some lions alone in a cage just staring onto you. We love animals and game parks, but this place will never see us again, because it's sad to see",
          "If you like your wildlife natural then give this game park a miss. The initial drive through is great. You see giraffe, Zebra etc but when you get to the big cats it is just sad. Large cats in small sand enclosures being treated as overgrown teddy bears by tourists who want",
          "Visited in May 2011. You get to see lots of lions just chilling - I guess midday was not the best time to visit. Maybe early morning next time. But the highlight was that we managed to play and got an amazing photos with baby lions :) They were a bit grumpy because it was before",
          "First start with the good news: the entrance of the park is beautiful, a long road and a lot of lovely animals like giraffes, wildebeest. But when we parked the car and were friendly showed where to walk. We were so disappointed, small fields for these big animals. On the hill",
          "Next to the road to Seaview lion park is a squatter camp, growing bigger. I would like to know what happens to all the baby white lions that they breed. I hope they are not sold for canned hunting.",
          "The entrance of the park is beautifull, but when I was there the lions where sleeping in the corner where you could barely see them. It's worth a visit but it might be more fun when they feed the lions.",
          "We had a great time here. We saw lots of zebra and giraffe as well as the lions. There are plenty of lions and tigers to see with some great close ups. Up at the restaurant area there is an opportunity to see some caracul's, baby lion and tiger and even a black leopard, plus",
          "I have been visiting this park for the last 12 years and it has improved greatly since Randy and Janet purchased it .We always go at least once or twice and it has been a good day out when in PE ; My daughter and son in law even adopted a white lion for me .He is called Joseph",
          "It is reasonably priced and offers a great day out. It is self drive and many animals can be seen at a close range. The entrance fee covers seeing all the animals but optional costs are necessary if visitors wish to touch the animals, mainly lion or tiger cubs. However, you",
          "...but no. It does not do it for me. Lions in cages, etc. The game reserves seems far more better. Nice surroundings with giraffas at the parking space, but....",
          "Lovely drive into the park while spotting birds, buck and giraffe. Very informative guides. Not sure how safe it is to go into the area with the \"teenage\" lions and tigers though.",
          "The park in general is quite small, especially if you've been in Addo, Kruger national parks or a large game reserve. However, the close and personal experience of playing with Tiger and Lion cubs was worth it. By paying a small extra fee you are allowed to go inside and play",
          "If you want to see a small number of bored animals cooped up in cages, this is the place for you. Definitely not what we came to Africa to see.",
          "After visiting Kruger Park, Seaview Lion Park was abysmal in comparison. The younger tigers and lions are kept in small fenced off areas which seem too unnatural and unhealthy for a wild animal. It is sad seeing them locked up after seeing them free at Kruger. I would not",
          "it was absolutely an amazing experience to play witht he tiger cubs but the prices are expensive for such a short period of time",

          "What shocking service we received! The staff (volunteer at help desk) was VERY rude, even mimicing my accent and what i'd just asked for and then telling me to get back in the line and wait like everyone else. I was joining the queue to pay for drinks for my guests that were",

          "It was good to be able to pat a baby lion here, and the smallness of the park meant that seeing game was easy. The person who was there when we patted the lion was helpful with taking photos. This would be better than 'average', but I was confused about why there were baby lions",

          "Pop down here after you've been to the penguin rescue centre. It's a lovely walk around the lighthouse and along the beach.",
          "Parked at the light house and took a walk around it. The view is absolutely stunning. So happy we went here.",
          "Beautiful beautiful quiet beach with gorgeous light house! A definitely must go the kids. They ran around all day and played in the rock pools. Such a tranquil, gorgeous beach!",
          "Beautiful unspoilt reserve. A lovely place to visit. Great place for a walk along the beach. some great views.",
          "Don't miss this lighthouse when visiting Port Elizabeth. It is a wonderful gem and the views are amazing",
          "Some spectacular views. We were wondering why a permit would cost R72.15. The seabird rescue centre bit overprised and there is still not a coffee shop",
          "We've done the coastal drive and turned into the Reserve for a beautiful wind still sunny afternoon drive. The nature and seaview and birdwatching was fantastic",
          "Simply relax and enjoy the breeze. The walk on the beach, the smells of nature, fish in the sea pools, the flock of birds, you can easily spend the whole afternoon there.",
          "Drive to the lighthouse and walk on the beach. Explore! The rock pools, beach, sea creatures and birds were fascinating. A lovely way to spend the morning. Simply lovely and peaceful.",
          "Great venue for long walks, cycling, beach, lighthouse and stunning photographic opportunities too. Looking forward to a return visit.",
          "The park is a beautiful respite, especially given it is so near to PE. Flocks of shore birds are along the shore and occaisionally take flight in beautiful synchrony. The cape is popular with cyclists, fishermen and birders. Great location for relaxing near the shore, walks",
          "Most people should head out to the lighthouse and enjoy the unusual sea water pools in the sand and rocks. Nest at low tide. Half way to the lighthouse is a bird hide for those that enjoy bird watching,",
          "Visitied Cape Recife yesterday and was blown away. Firstly by the wind and secondly by the beauty of this place. It is stunning. Great beach loved the sand dunes to. Lots of amazing photos opportunities. It is so vast as well you almost feel like the only people there.",
          "My wife and i recently made a trip to Port Elizabeth and took a drive to view sites. The Cape Recife Nature Reserve was on of our stops. Awesome walk, beautiful views and plenty of postcard worthy pictures. A good spot to check out when you are in the area.",
          "I can only speak to the walking as I walked along the coast here from Port Elizabeth. It's a very quiet, peaceful and beautiful place to walk though.",
          "The beaches are desolate and open with beautiful expanses of beach and ocean. We went on a tour of the lighthouse that is wonderfully kept. They have some diesel generators that offer backup power and you can see the ones they have used in the past, all beautifully kept and",
          "Well worth visiting. Some amazing beach and bush walks with plenty to be seen on the beach, in the rock pools and in the bush. If you are into birding there are bird hides and numerous species for you to view. A place to relax and take in the sights, sounds and smells of nature",
          "a great place to fish, surf, hike or just spend a day on the beach...a day permit allows you access and don't forget to visit the penguin centre",
          "Excelllent walk on the beach and in the natural vegetation, absorbing the sights, sounds and smells of nature-so scenic.What a beautiful country we live in!",
          "great place to visit, money well spent. the trails is great and beach amazingrich in birdlife and beach have rockpools rich with sea life",
          "It is Natures drama at work. Both high and low tides bring with it a scene to be revered and appreciated. Here you are at the tip of the bay, on the real wild side. The lighthouse stands tall, marking the spot where you can turn up left and you walk towards civilization or turn",
          "We popped in to have a look at the lighthouse and was very disappointed that it was not, like many others on the coast, open to visitors. So we walked around and took photos, and then had a look at a few other places in the reserve. The bird hide was a dud due to vegetation over",
          "We loved our visit to the reserve. Great walks along the beach near the lighthouse. so many interesting things uncovered by the changing tides - every visit unearths a new surprise. A very peaceful and relatively safe area in today's challenging world.",

          "Went with friends to escort a UK visitor - we were all enthralled - Wonderful knowledgeable guide (and enthusiast). Expected just penguins, but saw much more - there are even civets and house snakes being cared for. Superb display of what local craftsmen (and women) are doing to",

          "You have to have a permit to get into this nature reserve but they are easily available from the beach managers office. The cost is reasonable - about R250 for the year. This gives you access to an unspoiled and beautiful part of the coast - lovely views and stunning beaches !",
          "Would be 5 stars if we didn't have to pay to access but factoring that in it is kind of average after seeing similar things for free. We had some down time during our stay in PE and stopped by to check this place out. There were a couple of pull offs and of course the light",

          "I have been to beaches all over the world and I come from a country (Brazil) full of beaches but this spot is simply amazing! Completely in love with the Cape Recife. I have paid to go to the beach twice in my live: Curacao and now Port Elizabeth. Starting to accept to pay to go",
          "We have been in other capes in South Africa so my evaluation is based in the state of conservation. This cape is very beautiful, here you can explain to your kids what is a cape because you can easily see it, but it is not well maintained unfortunately. We travelled for other",

          "We went for an 8km walk around the nature reserve. Along the beach is lovely although if you go for the walk dont wear flipflops or sandals as stony in places and continues to be rough terrain around parts of the walk. Lovely scenery . We parked outside the gate and walked in,",

          "We were pleasantly surprised by this lovely piece of land. We spent a few hours just exploring the rock pools. We went back another morning to do a trail run but unfortunately the route was not as well marked as promised on a website so ended up having to run a lot on the road.",
          "In peak season, I could still find a peaceful beach here. The lighthouse is beautiful and a wedding party were finishing up their photos in this beautiful, close to nature setting. You pay R62 odd for a permit for a vehicle but it can be used for a week and is so worth it.",

          "We visited the reserve as part of a tour of Port Elizabeth with 'Alan's tours', which included stopping at the SAMREC bird rescue / rehabilitation centre, climbing to the top of the lighthouse, walking on the dunes and driving through the reserve. Well worth doing! The views",
          "Away from the noise of the city, wonderful fynbos and plants. Animals like zebra and buck are in the reserve, you can walk, no lions or dangerous animals. You can climb the lighthouse steps yo the top if with a guide penguin rehabilitation centre at the reserve.",
          "The Cape Recife Lighthouse is a beautiful spot (close to the city) to get out for a while and appreciate the natural beauty of this reserve. We visited on a day for sundowners, when a storm was about to roll in. It was magnificent, with some very special memories, and Instagram",

          "If you're staying on Marine Drive and you have a bike with you, feel free to cycle westward to the end of this road. Very quickly the traffic and hustle and bustle of the main strip will give way to a quiet coast line with hardly any cars. On the way, stop off at the penguin",

          "We only had a short walk from our coach stop and easy access through the gates. This is a nice traditional ground with loads of character and a great atmosphere. Entrance to the toilets was dark but once inside they are bright, clean and well stocked. There is a good selection",
          "Saw the first two days of recent England test match here. Lovely old ground with plenty of character, friendly staff and good views of cricket. Only minor criticism was lack of WiFi and could find anywhere to buy a glass of wine. Beer and food good value and easy to get to ground",

          "The park was not busy but were wandered towards the Cricket Stadium only to see a Council worker fast asleep on a bench and 2 chefs in the cricket stadium having a break! Otherwise, it is not well signposted and we did not feel very safe. I would imagine that it comes alive",
          "I have been told that this park is safe(ish) during the day, and even then not to go alone. This is a shame because it is well looked after even though it is used by various 'street people'. The monuments were interesting, good photo opportunities. Not a place to go late",

          "Lovely new conservatory has opened which is worth visiting. Be careful about leaving handbags unattended. Rather go in a group. There have been attacks on tourists!",

          "As a Park there is nothing special to see here that you wouldn't see anywhere else. Safety and security are issues to take seriously and I have spoken with dozens of local people who have confirmed this. However it's fine if you are going for a specific reason and you know it",
          "This Park used to be something special but it needs a rethink and a revamp. It lies in the heart of the old city and houses the fantastic St Georges Park Cricket Grounds and adjoining art gallery. But the flora part needs to retire.",
          "Nice gardens. Nice for a jog around the park. But be aware of strangers. I would not venture here by myself!",
          "Unless you are coming to watch cricket or play tennis, there is no reason to spend time here. It is past it's prime.",
          "I had four days here for the South Africa v Australia Test match. The ground isn't within walking distance from the main hotels on the sea front but parking wasn't a problem and was free subject to a small payment to the car guards. I parked on some grassland about 50 yards from",
          "This could justify a 5 star rating, but other than the sports venues and the conservatory which are good, it is not easy to enjoy the lovely walks through the garden area unless you are in a group, as security is not great, especially for solitary females or elderly folk.",
          "A pleasant venue for the match between S Africa and Australia. The surrounding park looked good, too, with a large outdoor swimming pool visible from our area at the match.",
          "I warmly recommend to have a visit in this special place. I enjoyed the old trees, the quiet atmosphere, and the market called \"art in the park\" that is all the last sundays. last but not least this park is an historical place (1882)",
          "St George's Park is quintessentially PE. The nostalgia, the memories, the beauty, the bit of decay. It is something not to be missed - to get a feel of this weirdly sad but happy city on the east coast, with its colonial an african flavour. PE, I love you.",
          "What is the use of having a beautiful park that is so unsafe. No police to protect public. Not safe to go to at all. Chances are good that you will be robbed. No go area. I even feel unsafe walking on the outside of the park. Terrible car guards, intimidating. Once a month",
          "This park is one of those rare gems that you find by accident. Great for a good stroll, especially when you are visiting the hospital...",
          "It is always great to go watch a game of cricket at St George's. The coloured brass band make it very festive.",
          "Best feature -- the brass band!! Playing along, getting the crowd singing and just making the atmosphere electric! Prices here for food and drink are very cheap too - very impressed! And the singer and his band playing after the cricket was over was just the perfect ending to",
          "The park - especially at the Western end - is a haven of tranquility. The newly restored Victorian conservatory and gardens surrounding it, including the open-air theatre area are particularly attractive. The public swimming pools in the centre of the park can be a bit dodgy,",
          "This park has some of the loveliest trees one could hope to see and the pathways through the leafy groves are an absolute pleasure to wander along. The flowers in the exquisite Pearson Conservatory, a classical piece of Victorian architecture that has recently been beautifully",
          "Large area to roam and forget abouit the concrete jungle - close to the Cricket grounds and city centre with all of the restaurants and cinema.",
          "There are so many things to see in St Georges Park doesn't matter if you are into sport, history or gardens. I took my kids to see the newly revamped Pearson Conservatory and took a walk throught he park and gardens before the kids went to play in the play park. I wish more",

        "wiki": "Port Elizabeth or Nelson Mandela Bay (Xhosa: iBhayi, alternatively Gqebera; Afrikaans: Die Baai [di \u02c8b\u0251\u02d0i]) often known by its initials PE, and colloquially as \u201cThe Friendly City\u201dor \"The Windy City\", is a major seaport city and most populous city in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.  Port Elizabeth is the seat of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa's second largest metropolitan district by area.  It is the most-populous city of the Eastern Cape and the sixth most-populous city in South Africa. the most-populous city of Eastern Cape; and the cultural, economic and financial center of the Eastern Cape.  The city is among the top five cities in the world for pleasant weather, according to a 2014 scientific climate study of 600 global cities.  Port Elizabeth is known for many blue-flag beaches along the city's urban coastline; its popularity as an international and local holiday destination; and its rich and diverse cultural heritage.  It is a tourism gateway city for the Eastern Cape and the only city with the closest proximity to malaria-free big five game reserves.The economy of Port Elizabeth is primarily oriented towards automotive assembly, manufacturing and export industries, and the city is also a major South African and sub-Saharan African destination for investment. Foreign direct investments of $19,8 billion has been secured over the past decade. Several Fortune 500 companies have a presence or their African operations headquartered in Port Elizabeth. The city's most prominent landmarks are Shark Rock pier, the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, and the Donkin Reserve.\nPort Elizabeth is a popular domestic and international holiday destination.  It is a gateway city for Eastern Cape's adventure, outdoor and African big five game, malaria-free safari tourism.Port Elizabeth is located in the south eastern coast of South Africa.  It is situated on the western portion of Algoa Bay, adjacent to the Indian Ocean.  The city lies 770 km east of Cape Town, between South Africa's Garden Route and Wild Coast.  Port Elizabeth covers 251 square kilometers of the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area, South Africa's sixth largest metropolitan municipality. Fortune 500 companies are present or have their African operations headquartered in the city.  Port Elizabeth is the second oldest city in South Africa.  It was founded in 1820 by the government of the Cape Colony when 4,000 British colonists settled Algoa Bay to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa. The city's moderate subtropical climate ranks among the top ten cities in the world for highly pleasant, all year round weather, according to a Syracuse University climatology study.Port Elizabeth is a popular tourist holiday destination. Shark Rock Pier, a prominent installation on the shoreline of Port Elizabeth's Summerstrand precinct, is the city's most famous landmark.  Port Elizabeth is a tourism gateway city for big five game viewing, South Africa's national's arts festival, outdoor recreation, adventure tourism and numerous nature conservancies, including the Baviaanskloof mega-reserve, Port Elizabeth was one of the host cities for the official tournament of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-History ===\nCave sites not far from Port Elizabeth, such as Albany, Wilton and Howiesons Poort, have given their names to various archaeological cultures. The Howiesons Poort has been of particular interest to interpretations about the origins of fully modern human behaviour. Dating to 65 000 to 62 000 years ago, it has yielded extremely old evidence for bow and arrow hunting and shell-bead jewellery. Earlier and Middle Stone Age lithic material has been found in the Sundays River Valley, while at the important site of Amanzi Springs, 40 km north of the Port Elizabeth near Addo, Earlier Stone Age artefacts are found in situ with well-preserved plant and faunal remains within spring sediments (Deacon, 1970). There is Later Stone Age archaeological material preserved in caves and rock shelters, such as Melkhoutboom Cave, in the Cape Fold Belt Mountain surrounding Port Elizabeth (see Deacon and Deacon, 1963; Deacon, 1976; Binneman, 1997) and large numbers of coastal shell middens have been reported at Humewood, St. George's Strand and the Coega River Mouth (Rudner, 1968). Most recently, Binneman and Webley (1997) reported thirteen shell middens and stone tool scatters about 500 m east of the Coega River mouth in the archaeological assessment carried out for the development of maritime infrastructure for the Port of Ngqura. Importantly, some of this archaeological material was recorded in secondary context in the gravels from older river terraces along the banks of the Coega River.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nIn 1820, the rising seaport of Algoa Bay was named  \"Port Elizabeth\" in memory of Elizabeth Frances n\u00e9e Markham, the late wife of Rufane Shaw Donkin, acting Governor of the Cape Colony.  In 2019, the Eastern Cape Geographical Names Committee (ECGNC) announced the city of Port Elizabeth is likely to have its name changed to Gqeberha, a Xhosa word used to refer to the Baakens River that flows through the city.\n\n\n=== Early History ===\nHunters and gatherers ancestral to the San first settled the area around what is now called Algoa Bay at least 10,000 years ago. Around 2,000 years ago, they were gradually displaced or assimilated by agriculturalist populations ancestral to the Xhosa people, who migrated into the region from the north.\n\n\n=== British Settlement ===\nThe first Europeans to visit the area sailed with the Portuguese explorers Bartholomeu Dias, who landed on St Croix Island in Algoa Bay in 1488, and Vasco da Gama, who noted the nearby Bird Island in 1497. For centuries, the area appeared on European navigation charts marked simply as \"a landing place with fresh water\".The Portuguese Crown had as one of its main goals in the Indian Ocean taking over the lucrative trade of Arab and Afro-Arabian merchants who plied routes between the East African coast and India. As they took over that trade in Africa, the Portuguese strengthened trading with Goa, their main trading point in India. The name Algoa means \"to Goa\", just as the port further north in present-day Mozambique, Delagoa means \"from Goa\" in Portuguese.The area became part of the Cape Colony. This area had a turbulent history between the settlement by the Dutch East India Company in 1652 and the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910.\n\nIn 1799, at the time of the first British occupation of the Colony during the Napoleonic Wars, British troops built a stone fort named Fort Frederick after the Duke of York. This fort, aiming to deter a possible landing of French troops, was constructed to oversee the site of what later became Port Elizabeth. The fort is now preserved as a monument.From 1814 to 1821 the Strandfontein farm was owned by Piet Retief. He later became a Voortrekker leader and was killed in 1837 by Zulu king Dingane during negotiations about land. An estimated 500 men, woman and children of his party were massacred. Frederik Korsten owned the Strandfontein farm after Retief. The suburb of Korsten was named after Frederick in the 19th century. This area was later developed as the Summerstrand beach suburb of Port Elizabeth.In 1820 a party of 4,000 British settlers arrived by sea, encouraged by the government of the Cape Colony to form a settlement to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa people. At this time the seaport town was founded by Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin, the Acting Governor of the Cape Colony (in office: 1820-1821). \nDiplomat Edmund Roberts visited Port Elizabeth in the early 1830s. Roberts noted that Port Elizabeth in the 1820s had \"contained four houses, and now it has upward of one hundred houses, and its residents are rated at above twelve hundred persons\".The Roman Catholic Church established the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope, Eastern District in the city in 1847. Port Elizabeth was granted the status of autonomous municipality in 1861. \nCape Colony Prime Minister John Molteno had formed the Cape Government Railways in 1872. Completion of the railway to Kimberley in 1873 was a major stimulus to trade and a rapid increase in population in the town. With the massive expansion of the Cape Colony's railway network to the interior over the following years, the harbour of Port Elizabeth became the focus for serving import and export needs of a large area of the Cape's hinterland. The rapid economic development around the port, which followed the railway construction, caused Port Elizabeth to be nicknamed \"the Liverpool of South Africa\", after a major British port. The town expanded as a diverse community, comprising Xhosa as well as European, Cape Malay, and other immigrants.\n\nDuring the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902, the port served as an important transit-point for British soldiers, horses, and materials headed by railway to the front. No armed conflict took place within the city, but it felt the effects of the war with the arrival of many refugees who moved into the city. These included Boer women and children, whom the British interned in a concentration camp. \nAfter the war, the British erected a monument to military horses that died during the war. \"The unveiling of the monument commemorating the services of the horses which perished during the Anglo Boer War, 1899-1902, took place on Saturday afternoon, February 11, 1905, with His Worship the Mayor, Mr A Fettes, performing the ceremony.\"\n\n\n=== Apartheid era ===\nUnder apartheid, the South African government established legal racial segregation and started programs to separate communities physically as well as by classification and custom. The forced relocation under the auspices of the Group Areas Act of the non-white population from mixed areas began in 1962, causing various townships to be built for their use. Classification was sometimes arbitrary, and as in many other localities throughout the country, many citizens appearing to have mixed ancestry were at times subject to re-classification, which often had intrusive sociopolitical results. The non-white tenants of South End, and land owners in Fairview were forcibly relocated from 1965 through to 1975, as these areas were valued as prime real estate. The city-planning was viewed as the prototypical apartheid city.\nAs black South Africans organized to try to achieve civil rights and social justice, government repression increased. In 1977 Steve Biko, the black anti-apartheid activist, was interrogated and tortured by the security police in Port Elizabeth before being transported to Pretoria, where he died. Other notable deaths in the city during this time included those of The Cradock Four, and of George Botha, a high-school teacher.\n\n\n==== 1952 Defiance Campaign ====\nIn 1952 the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress (SAIC) called all South Africans to stand up against the apartheid government's unjust laws directed at the black African, Indian and coloured population. On April 6, while most white South Africans celebrated the tercentenary of Jan van Riebeeck's arrival at the Cape in 1652, the ANC and SAIC called on black South Africans to observe the day as a \"A National Day of Pledge and Prayer\". 15 000 people attended in Johannesburg, 10 000 in Cape Town, 10 000 in Durban and 20 000 in Port Elizabeth. The meeting in Port Elizabeth was led by Professor Z. K. Matthews and by Raymond Mhlaba.\nOn 25 July 1952, a day before the official start of the Defiance Campaign, 30 volunteers led by Raymond Mhlaba gathered at the New Brighton Civic Centre and prayed throughout the night. At 5am on 26 July, they left the Civic Centre and walked towards the New Brighton Railway Station. In Raymond Mhlaba's Personal Memoirs: Reminiscing from Rwanda and Uganda, Mhlaba recalled:\n\n\"I led the very first group and we entered the 'Europeans Only' section of the New Brighton station. By half past six we were already in police vans on our way to jail. It turned out that my party (group) was the very first to defy unjust laws in the whole of South Africa. Little did we know that we were making history.\"\n\nMhlaba became the first man to be arrested during the campaign, while Florence Matomela was the first woman. 2 007 people were arrested in Port Elizabeth during the Defiance Campaign included Oom Gov (Govan Mbeki) and Vuyisile Mini. Other volunteers who emerged as key role players during the campaign included Nosipho Dastile, Nontuthuzelo Mabala, Lilian Diedricks and Veronica Sobukwe.\n\n\n==== 1985 Consumer Boycotts ====\nAfter the formation of the ANC-affiliated United Democratic Front in 1983, political consciousness in black townships grew. With numerous protests across the country and the massacre in Langa township near Uitenhage, Eastern Cape police presence had increased in South African townships. In Port Elizabeth townships, black South Africans demanded the integration of public institutions, the removal of troops from black townships, and the end of workplace discrimination. To launch an effective campaign to cripple the white-owned institutions of Port Elizabeth and to undermine the legitimacy of apartheid, several women suggested the idea of a consumer boycott to the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO) in May 1985. The economic boycott began on July 15, 1985, and received massive support in townships around Port Elizabeth. By September 1985, white business-owners became desperate and called on the government to meet the demands of black South Africans. In November the boycott was still hurting white businesses in Port Elizabeth greatly. The white South African government reached an agreement with PEBCO which stated that the boycott would halt until March 1986 if business owners arranged for the release of black leaders.In 1986, as the deal was approaching its end, the boycotters imposed a deadline of March 31, stating that the boycott would resume if the initial demands were not met. On March 11, the government unexpectedly banned two leaders, one of whom was Mkuseli Jack. However, on March 22, the ban was lifted by the decision of a Supreme Court Justice on the grounds that the government had given insufficient reasons. Jack ripped up the ban papers, and used the celebration as a way to represent the solidarity that the campaign required. As the demands of the boycotters were not met by March 31, the boycott was renewed on April 1. The boycott continued for nine weeks, but on June 12, 1986, another state of emergency was imposed by the National Party government. Security forces searched through the townships, arresting thousands and raiding the offices of black civics, trade unions, the UDF, the South African Council, and churches and also confiscating documents.\n\n\n=== Modern History ===\nWith the establishment of the  Coega Industrial Development Zone (CIDZ), foreign direct and also national-level investment has improved substantially in the region of Nelson Mandela Bay/Port Elizabeth. The IDZ, under the stewardship of the Coega Development Corporation (CDC), since inception has managed to attract to its investment account in excess of R140-billion into the economy of the Eastern Cape and has enabled the creation of over 45 000 jobs. This is significant for the sustainability of the IDZ, Nelson Mandela Bay, and the economy of the Eastern Cape. The CDC consistently continues to demonstrate its capability as the leading catalyst for socio-economic growth in the Eastern Cape, with a view to becoming so for South Africa.\nIn 2001 the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality was formed as an administrative area covering Port Elizabeth, the neighbouring towns of Uitenhage and Despatch and the surrounding agricultural areas. The name honours former President Nelson Mandela. The combined metropolitan area had a population estimated at around 1.3 million in 2006.\n\n\n==== 2010 FIFA World Cup ====\nOvertaking its next door neighbouring city East London, Port Elizabeth became the host city for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium hosted eight World Cup games were South Korea vs Greece, Ivory Coast vs Portugal, Germany vs Serbia; Chile vs Switzerland, Slovenia vs England in the Group Stage, then Uruguay, South Korea in the Round of 16. A quarter-final between Netherlands, Brazil was hosted, then for the Third Place playoff, Uruguay, Germany were hosted at the stadium. The World Cup was played between 11 June 2010 and 11 July 2010. Spain were the eventual champions.\n\n\n==== 2013 Africa Cup of Nations ====\nPort Elizabeth was also one of the five cities that hosted the 2013 Afcon event. Same stadium of 2010 World Cup hosted eight games: five matches of Group B included Ghana, DR Congo; Mali, Niger; Ghana, Mali; DR. Congo, Niger; Ghana, Niger; one match of Group A Cape Verde, Angola. Quarterfinal Ghana, Cape Verde, then Third Place playoff Ghana, Mali. The Africa Cup of Nations took place between 19 January and 10 February 2013. Nigeria were eventual champions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Port Elizabeth has an oceanic climate (Cfb\u202f). The area lies between the winter rainfall, Mediterranean climate zones of the Western Cape and the summer rainfall regions of eastern South Africa. Winters are cool but mild and summers are warm but considerably less humid and hot than more northerly parts of South Africa's east coast. The climate is very even throughout the year with extreme heat or moderate cold rare.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nPort Elizabeth represents a large percentage of South Africa's biological diversity and the city is a confluence point five of the seven South African biomes, namely the Thicket, Grassland, Nama-Karoo, Fynbos and Forest Biomes. A number of municipal nature reserves have been included in, and can be visited along the \u201cOutward Bound Route\u201d of the city. A mosaic of these 5 Biomes could be experienced in these reserves. The outward bound route is an eco-outdoor adventure and sports route incorporating walking and wildlife experiences. The aim of this route is to spread tourism to similar attractions along the route, leading to increased foot traffic and related benefits to these sites.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nAs a British colonial town, the city had a strongly British character, and the central area retains that to this day. Few of the buildings featured in this tour would be out of place in an English market town.  The colonial City Hall is a national monument. The Port Elizabeth main public library is an excellent example of Victorian Gothic architecture. Various memorials are situated throughout the city environs, and there are many tours available to familiarise visitors with especially the apartheid era. Port Elizabeth could be considered to be the country's leading centre of Art Nouveau style architecture due to its European heritage. Many buildings display the intricate stonework, wrought iron and stained glass of that era which are prominently visible in the Central Historical areas of the city. Combinations of Art Nouveau and Colonial styles are seen in residences along Cape Road.The area also boasts a collection of Cape Dutch style architecture as well as the Victorian and Edwardian styles, resulting from the arrival of the 1820 British settlers. Although influenced by Dutch architecture, the Cape Dutch style is unique to South Africa and examples can be seen all over the Eastern and Western Cape. \n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\nPort Elizabeth has numerous water features in its encompassing area.  There is a vast length of marine coastline on the city's outer encroachments particularly southwards. Beaches like Kings Beach, Hobie Beach, Bluewater Bay, Sardinia Bay, and the beaches along Marine Drive are abundant. Kings Beach is adjacent to Port Elizabeth's harbour, and the longshore drift from Cape Recife provides a plentiful supply of sea sand. On the north westerly coastline of Port Elizabeth, the contours tends to be rockier than the area between Cape Recife, and the Port of Ngqura. Port Elizabeth has a few rivers, of which the Baakens River is the most prominent. This river usually floods when a reasonable amount precipitation is observed, especially at low level crossings. North End Lake is the largest natural freshwater body in Port Elizabeth, but has experienced a form of contamination from industry. (It is not recommended to ingest anything from this lake) Also, numerous smaller \"lakes\" are in the surrounding area, namely Lake Farm.  Port Elizabeth (as a whole, the entire Eastern Cape) is experiencing a devastating drought, of which a disaster has been declared by the current office bearers of the greater municipality. Water restrictions are in place, and measures are in place to provide enough water in the near future, namely freshwater treatment works being constructed to acquire additional water from the Gariep Dam.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPort Elizabeth is the most populous city in the Eastern Cape. In 2001:\nArea: 335.3 square kilometres (129.5 sq mi)\nPopulation: 237,502: 708.32 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,834.5/sq mi)\nHouseholds: 70,606: 210.58 per square kilometre (545.4/sq mi)\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Trade and industry ===\nThe largest economic sectors in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro are manufacturing, finance, community services and transport. Community services, trade and manufacturing sectors are the sectors that create the most employment in the Metro. The city offers a wealth of tourism and recreation opportunity due to its biodiversity, beaches and open spaces.  Further still, Nelson Mandela Bay is a preferred region for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, flour, meat, frozen veggies, soft drinks, chocolates, cheese, yoghurt, ice-cream, paper and leather products.Historically, the majority of trade in the region came through Port Elizabeth. In the 1830s, at least five ships regularly transported goods to Europe. It became a free port in 1832. In 1833, about 50 vessels had moved through the port. In 1828, 55,201 pounds, (25038 kg), of goods were imported through the port, increasing by 1832 to 112,845 pounds, (51185 kg), imported in that year. Port Elizabeth exported 41,290 pounds, (18738 kg), in 1828, with a large increase to 86,931 pounds, (39431 kg), goods exported in 1829. Exports included wine, brandy, vinegar, ivory, hides and skins, leather, tallow, butter, soap, wool, ostrich feathers, salted beef, wheat, candles, aloe, barley, and more.Home of South Africa's motor vehicle industry, Port Elizabeth boasts most vehicle assembly plants, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Continental Tyres and many other automotive-related companies. As of 2018, after GM's exit from Port Elizabeth and South Africa, Isuzu took over their production plant in Struandale. In 2016, Chinese state-owned automotive manufacturer BAIC and South Africa's Industrial Development Corporation announced a R11 billion joint venture for the establishment of a semi knock down vehicle assembly plant in Coega.  It is anticipated that the plant will go online in 2020.  The FAW also have built a multi-billion rand plant in the region. Most other industries in Port Elizabeth are geared towards the motor vehicle industry, providing parts such as wiring harnesses, catalytic converters, batteries and tyres to the vehicle manufacturers.\nPort Elizabeth is also a major seaport, with the most significant car loading facilities in the southern hemisphere. As part of the ongoing development, a new Industrial Development Zone with expanded port facilities has been built at Coega.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nLocated at the end of the picturesque Garden Route along the Cape coast, the city has beaches in and near it. The most popular swimming beaches include King's Beach and Hobie Beach.\nMany local historic attractions are linked by the Donkin Heritage Trail. These include the Campanile (bell tower), built in 1923 to commemorate the arrival of the 1820 Settlers and offering a viewpoint over the city; the city hall (1862); the Donkin Reserve park and monument; and the old stone Fort Frederick itself (1799). The CBD also boasts the towering Eastern Cape post office headquarters.\nRoute 67 is a walking trail consisting of 67 public artworks, symbolising 67 years which Nelson Mandela dedicated to the freedom of South Africa. The artwork is a celebration of South African culture and history and is scattered along the route as it starts from the Campanile, up the stairs to the Vuysile Mini Market Square and to the large South African flag at the Donkin Reserve. The artworks were created by local Eastern Cape artists.Other attractions include the gardens at St George's Park, the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum (formerly known as the King George VI Art Gallery), the museum and oceanography room at Humewood, and the new Boardwalk waterfront complex.\nThe wider area surrounding PE also features game viewing opportunities, including the Addo Elephant National Park, 72 kilometres (45 mi) to the north near the Zuurberg mountain range.\nPort Elizabeth is also a destination for whale watching with humpback whales sighted between June and August, and again between November and January, southern right whales sighted between July and November, and Bryde's whales sighted all year round.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe biggest sporting events in Port Elizabeth, is the annual Ironman triathlon and the Herald Cycle tour. The Tuna classic deep-sea fishing competition attracts anglers from all over the world.\nThe city has facilities catering for cricket, rugby union, athletics, association football, field hockey and many other sports. Its coastal location also makes it a base for many watersports.\nPort Elizabeth is the location of the St George's Park cricket ground, which holds test cricket matches. St George's Park is the oldest cricket ground in South Africa, and was the venue for the first Test match played outside of Australia or England, between South Africa and England on 12 and 13 March 1889. The Warriors, a franchise cricket team in South Africa, is based in Port Elizabeth. The stadium is also known for its band that entertains fans at the Proteas games.\nThe headquarters of the Southern Spears rugby franchise was in Port Elizabeth. The long-standing Eastern Province Rugby Union, now commonly known as the Eastern Province Elephants, formed the basis of the Spears franchise together with East London's Border Bulldogs. The remnants of the Spears were later reconstituted into the Southern Kings, also based in Port Elizabeth, which joined Super Rugby in 2013. The Southern Kings did not participate in Super Rugby in 2014 or 2015, and returned to Super Rugby in 2016, 2017, but were dropped for economical reasons by SARU. The team now competes in the Guinness Pro14. The Eastern Province Rugby Union play their home matches at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, built for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn December 2011, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium became the new home of the South Africa Sevens, the country's leg of the annual IRB Sevens World Series in rugby sevens. The event had previously been held in three other cities, most recently in George in the Western Cape from 2002 to 2010. As of 2015, is hosted annually in Cape Town, in the Western Cape.\nThe city's main football club is Chippa United, they currently use the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium as their home ground. Previous clubs to play in the country's top tier were Bay United, Michau Warriors, Port Elizabeth Blackpool, Hotspur F.C., Port Elizabeth City and Westview Apollon.\nThe Algoa Bay Yacht Club operates out of the Port of Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n== Government ==\nPort Elizabeth had its own municipality from 1843 to 2000.  Since then, it has formed part of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, and serves as the seat for the surrounding Cacadu District Municipality. It has a Magistrate's Court, a local seat of the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court, and a branch of the Labour Court. As a result of the presence of a High Court, several other related organs of state such as a Masters Office and a Director of Public Prosecutions are present in the city.\nAll Government (mostly provincial) departments maintain branches or other offices in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe Port Elizabeth municipality assumed a coat of arms on 9 January 1878.  The design, prepared by Bradbury Wilkinson and Company (of London), was a simplified version of the arms of Sir Rufane Donkin : Gules,  on a chevron Argent between two cinquefoils in chief and a bugle horn stringed in base Or, three buckles Sable;  a chief embattled Argent thereon an elephant statant proper.  The crest was a sailing ship, and the motto In meliora spera.\n(In layman's terms : a red shield displaying, from top to bottom, an elephant on a silver horizontal strip whose lower edge is embattled, two gold cinquefoils, a silver chevron bearing three black buckles, and a gold bugle horn.)\nEighty years later, in 1958, the council made slight changes to the arms, and had them granted by the College of Arms.  The changes consisted of adding two anchors to the chief of the shield, placing a red mural crown bearing three golden rings below the ship in the crest, and changing the motto to Tu meliora spera.  The arms were registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in 1959, and at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1986.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University Level ===\nThe Nelson Mandela University was formed by the amalgamation of the University of Port Elizabeth, Port Elizabeth Technikon, and the Port Elizabeth campus of Vista University. It is the largest university in the Eastern and Southern Cape, with around 29,000 students in seven faculties spread over seven campuses.\nRussell Road College and AFDA also have campuses in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== High School Level ===\nThe city has a number of top government-funded and private schools, although the abuse of substances seems to prevail in some schools due to a lack of drug prevention training on the part of the educational system, including Alexander Road High School, Collegiate Girls' High School, Victoria Park High School, Grey High School, Pearson High School, Woodridge College, Andrew Rabie High School and Lawson Brown High School.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nPort Elizabeth lies on the N2 road. To the west the road travels the Garden Route to George and Cape Town; to the east, the road runs through the Border Country through Makhanda, to East London then on to Durban, terminating in Ermelo in Mpumalanga. The R75 connects Port Elizabeth to the Karoo. The major routes within the city are numbered as metropolitan or M routes.\nThe city's main bus station is in Market Square. The public bus service is run by the Algoa Bus Company.  Between 1881 and 1948, there was a Port Elizabeth tramway network, powered initially by horses, and later by electricity.\nThe city is in the process of building a bus rapid transit system which was intended for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This has been a massive failure as local taxi associations have prevented the implementation. Port Elizabeth lacks a proper public transport system which has had a negative impact on the poorer residents of the city who are dependent on public transport. Construction of the bus rapid transit network has been suspended due to mismanagement which led to the project missing its May 2010 deadline. Calls for the project, which has left many parts of the city in a permanent state of construction, have been made recently, and it is expected that the government will make a decision on the matter soon.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nPort Elizabeth railway station is served by South Africa's rail network. Local commuter services are operated by Metrorail, while the Shosholoza Meyl long-distance passenger service links PE with Johannesburg via Bloemfontein where it is possible to connect with other long-distance routes.The Apple Express narrow-gauge tourist train to Avontuur operated from the separate station in Humewood Road near King's Beach. It departed regularly for Thornhill Village via Van Stadens River bridge, the highest narrow-gauge rail bridge in the world. The Apple Express was launched to provide a service to transport fresh produce and wood from the farms along the line to Avontuur. The line was completed in 1914 and the train delivered produce directly from the farms to ships in the Port Elizabeth Harbour. Due to modern transport methods such as containerisation, and refrigerated containers and trucks, the Apple Express and its services became redundant. Service has now ceased.\nIn preparation for the 2010 World Cup Soccer event the Humerail Station was extensively upgraded. Several disused narrow gauge goods wagons were scrapped and removed from the site, several buildings in the area have also been renovated and revamped.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nPort Elizabeth Airport (IATA airport code PLZ, ICAO airport code FAPE) serves the city for both passenger and cargo traffic. It is the fourth busiest airport in South Africa after O.R. Tambo International Airport, King Shaka International Airport in Durban, and Cape Town International Airport.\nInternational visitors to the city must currently fly to either Johannesburg, Cape Town or Durban, and then take a domestic flight to Port Elizabeth. An upgrade to the terminal building, completed in 2004, created the necessary facilities to handle international flights although none are scheduled as yet.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nPort Elizabeth has a harbour in Algoa Bay, and the construction of an additional international harbour at Coega has supported an increase in the size of the city's industries and the addition of new industries.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city has government-funded and private hospitals, including:\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nPort Elizabeth is served by a few radio outlets, namely Algoa FM, Umhlobo Wenene FM (radio broadcasting to the residents of Port Elizabeth, as well as the entire Eastern Cape, and Garden Route, and globally, online.)\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nThe Herald serves the English populace in terms of newspaper, on a daily basis. Die Burger serves the Afrikaans communities as well with a well established readership base.\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nThere are various social media news groups in Port Elizabeth, which is used at most as neighbourhood watch groups.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe SABC has a regional office in Port Elizabeth.  Bay TV is a free-to-air station established by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality that broadcasts 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. The station focusses on African story-telling and creating platforms for local content creators, and receives funding from local government and corporate donors.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n Beira, Mozambique\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nRed Location Museum\nList of heritage sites in Port Elizabeth\nFort Frederick, Eastern Cape\nBloemendal\nNational Monument\nVictorian era\nDonkin Heritage Trail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPort Elizabeth of Yore: The Defiance Campaign of 1952",

        "wiki": "The Van Stadens Wild Flower Reserve (Afrikaans: Van Stadens-veldblomreservaat) near Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, South Africa, is one of the oldest nature reserves in the country.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe park covers 600 hectares and lies 40 km west of Port Elizabeth, on an old stretch at the top of Van Stadens Pass. The Van Stadens River forms the western border, the N2 road runs through the area, and from here one has a good view of the gorge of the River, the Van Stadens Bridge, and northeast toward the Lady Slipper Trail. The reserve was founded in 1951 and is owned by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe main purpose of the reserve is to grow unique, indigenous plants, but it is also used as a center for environmental education. A traditional Xhosa hut, household articles, and a kraal with farm equipment give insight into Xhosa culture. There is also an arboretum and a plant nursery there. Walking, hiking, and mountain biking trails as well as picnic areas are available.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nCape fynbos is the natural biome here. Many species of proteas, orchids, and Erica can be found, as well as succulent plants and rare cycads. The lily Cyrtanthus stadensis is endemic to the park. Among the 60 species of trees found here is the rare Cape wing-nut (Atalaya capensis), only growing here, in the surrounding mountains, and near Suurberg Pass. There is also a large grove of Cape chestnut, Colodendrum capense. Notable fauna include the threatened Cape dwarf chameleon and certain species of frog. 170 species of birds have been spotted here.\n\n\n== Rock art ==\nThe park is generally held to contain the southernmost rock art in Africa.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLogie, Bartle.

          "Just 20 min from the city limits, a perfect place for a change of scenery and fresh air. The two hikes are very different but great. Picnic or just a flask of coffee on a bench will recharge the battery. Flat, jeep tracks and single tracks perfect for beginner or young children",
          "To think of how the Van Staden Bridge was constracted is mind boggling, land scaping is beautiful and unspoiled nature is appealing, however, the municipality of Port Elizabeth took a decision to prohibit vehicles form stopping on the bridge to view the beauty of nature due to",
          "I stayed here as a child and loved it. I have been back many times since...in fact every time I have business or pleasure in PE I stay at this venue. Coming from the UK this time, we were provided with bedding, late arrival and a refund of damage deposit at exit. This business",

          "Situated a mere 40 kilometres from Port Elizabeth, the reserve is a hidden gem for nature enthusiasts and fitness junkies alike. The reserve has no entry fee and has various tarred and gravel roads around the reserve. There are lovely hiking trails and mountain bike paths, all",

          "This reserve is only a 30 min drive from Port Elizabeth and is well signposted. Sections of roads in the reserve are tarred, others gravel and then there are routes more suitable for hikers and quad/mountain bikers. Before you set out to explore the reserve, look at the info",
          "I have been here several times for research related activities, and I am captured each time by how gorgeous it is. With ericas and proteas flowering all around you and the air thick with the calls of sunbirds and sugarbirds this place is a feast for the senses for any nature",
          "The Van Stadens Bridge on the N2 was opened on November 11, 1971. It is a great sight to visit. It is also very emotional as so many people used it to commit suicide",

          "Every time I've been here, I have enjoyed the few hours in this reserve. It is not a botanical garden in the sense of wooden walkways and artificial gardens. instead you are between bright flowering Proteas in their wild habitat. I will definitely return to one of the picnic",

          "I had such a great time at the Nature Reserve yesterday. It's a wonderful way to spend an afternoon - and it's free! I did the Forest Walk and really enjoyed myself. It's more hiking than walking though, so I would definitely recommend wearing hiking shoes for this trail. It",
          "It is a must for everyone visiting the PE area, only 25 minutes drive from PE. The van Stadens Nature Reserve is a forest area where once elephants roamed the area and an abundance of wild life was seen by early travellers.",

          "Don't expect a fancy developed botanical garden when you go to the Wildflower Reserve. This is about getting back to nature yet close to the city. The paths are well maintained and easy to follow. Beautiful views across the Van Stadens gorge and even more beautiful King",
          "This reserve is in a excellent location and provides beautiful scenery and views. The flowers were in bud when we were there and everything was looking well maintained. It is a shame that there are no real facilities on site and for a simple cup of coffee you need to drive",
          "The kids enjoy the nature and swimming. If you want to go camping or just an day visit this is the place to go.",
          "I had an afternoon spare which in PE so when out there for a quick visit. It's mostly a wildflower reserve, but there seems to be a lot of walks that could be pretty cool. The best part for me was the views over the gorge and bridge at the far end of the park. There were toilet",

          "A beautiful place, but they need to work on their signage because it can be very misleading. Also they need to specify how strenuous the walks are for those who might not have the correct fitness level. Still a beautiful place though and I especially loved the forest walk.",
          "Within the boundaries of the VS conservancy lies the Van Stadens wildflower reserve. When the wildflowers bloom there, its amazing. Anywhere else in the world, it would probably be an important point of destination, but here in PE.... Only a handful of people seem to know about",
          "This is a wonderful half day trip from PE and you get to see some lovely flora. The Reserve offers lovely views over the van Stadens ravine and has very rpetty picnic spots. It is mostly deserted and makes for a very peaceful afternoon or morning. Take a picnic as there is no",

        "wiki": "Port Elizabeth or Nelson Mandela Bay (Xhosa: iBhayi, alternatively Gqebera; Afrikaans: Die Baai [di \u02c8b\u0251\u02d0i]) often known by its initials PE, and colloquially as \u201cThe Friendly City\u201dor \"The Windy City\", is a major seaport city and most populous city in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.  Port Elizabeth is the seat of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa's second largest metropolitan district by area.  It is the most-populous city of the Eastern Cape and the sixth most-populous city in South Africa. the most-populous city of Eastern Cape; and the cultural, economic and financial center of the Eastern Cape.  The city is among the top five cities in the world for pleasant weather, according to a 2014 scientific climate study of 600 global cities.  Port Elizabeth is known for many blue-flag beaches along the city's urban coastline; its popularity as an international and local holiday destination; and its rich and diverse cultural heritage.  It is a tourism gateway city for the Eastern Cape and the only city with the closest proximity to malaria-free big five game reserves.The economy of Port Elizabeth is primarily oriented towards automotive assembly, manufacturing and export industries, and the city is also a major South African and sub-Saharan African destination for investment. Foreign direct investments of $19,8 billion has been secured over the past decade. Several Fortune 500 companies have a presence or their African operations headquartered in Port Elizabeth. The city's most prominent landmarks are Shark Rock pier, the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, and the Donkin Reserve.\nPort Elizabeth is a popular domestic and international holiday destination.  It is a gateway city for Eastern Cape's adventure, outdoor and African big five game, malaria-free safari tourism.Port Elizabeth is located in the south eastern coast of South Africa.  It is situated on the western portion of Algoa Bay, adjacent to the Indian Ocean.  The city lies 770 km east of Cape Town, between South Africa's Garden Route and Wild Coast.  Port Elizabeth covers 251 square kilometers of the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area, South Africa's sixth largest metropolitan municipality. Fortune 500 companies are present or have their African operations headquartered in the city.  Port Elizabeth is the second oldest city in South Africa.  It was founded in 1820 by the government of the Cape Colony when 4,000 British colonists settled Algoa Bay to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa. The city's moderate subtropical climate ranks among the top ten cities in the world for highly pleasant, all year round weather, according to a Syracuse University climatology study.Port Elizabeth is a popular tourist holiday destination. Shark Rock Pier, a prominent installation on the shoreline of Port Elizabeth's Summerstrand precinct, is the city's most famous landmark.  Port Elizabeth is a tourism gateway city for big five game viewing, South Africa's national's arts festival, outdoor recreation, adventure tourism and numerous nature conservancies, including the Baviaanskloof mega-reserve, Port Elizabeth was one of the host cities for the official tournament of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-History ===\nCave sites not far from Port Elizabeth, such as Albany, Wilton and Howiesons Poort, have given their names to various archaeological cultures. The Howiesons Poort has been of particular interest to interpretations about the origins of fully modern human behaviour. Dating to 65 000 to 62 000 years ago, it has yielded extremely old evidence for bow and arrow hunting and shell-bead jewellery. Earlier and Middle Stone Age lithic material has been found in the Sundays River Valley, while at the important site of Amanzi Springs, 40 km north of the Port Elizabeth near Addo, Earlier Stone Age artefacts are found in situ with well-preserved plant and faunal remains within spring sediments (Deacon, 1970). There is Later Stone Age archaeological material preserved in caves and rock shelters, such as Melkhoutboom Cave, in the Cape Fold Belt Mountain surrounding Port Elizabeth (see Deacon and Deacon, 1963; Deacon, 1976; Binneman, 1997) and large numbers of coastal shell middens have been reported at Humewood, St. George's Strand and the Coega River Mouth (Rudner, 1968). Most recently, Binneman and Webley (1997) reported thirteen shell middens and stone tool scatters about 500 m east of the Coega River mouth in the archaeological assessment carried out for the development of maritime infrastructure for the Port of Ngqura. Importantly, some of this archaeological material was recorded in secondary context in the gravels from older river terraces along the banks of the Coega River.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nIn 1820, the rising seaport of Algoa Bay was named  \"Port Elizabeth\" in memory of Elizabeth Frances n\u00e9e Markham, the late wife of Rufane Shaw Donkin, acting Governor of the Cape Colony.  In 2019, the Eastern Cape Geographical Names Committee (ECGNC) announced the city of Port Elizabeth is likely to have its name changed to Gqeberha, a Xhosa word used to refer to the Baakens River that flows through the city.\n\n\n=== Early History ===\nHunters and gatherers ancestral to the San first settled the area around what is now called Algoa Bay at least 10,000 years ago. Around 2,000 years ago, they were gradually displaced or assimilated by agriculturalist populations ancestral to the Xhosa people, who migrated into the region from the north.\n\n\n=== British Settlement ===\nThe first Europeans to visit the area sailed with the Portuguese explorers Bartholomeu Dias, who landed on St Croix Island in Algoa Bay in 1488, and Vasco da Gama, who noted the nearby Bird Island in 1497. For centuries, the area appeared on European navigation charts marked simply as \"a landing place with fresh water\".The Portuguese Crown had as one of its main goals in the Indian Ocean taking over the lucrative trade of Arab and Afro-Arabian merchants who plied routes between the East African coast and India. As they took over that trade in Africa, the Portuguese strengthened trading with Goa, their main trading point in India. The name Algoa means \"to Goa\", just as the port further north in present-day Mozambique, Delagoa means \"from Goa\" in Portuguese.The area became part of the Cape Colony. This area had a turbulent history between the settlement by the Dutch East India Company in 1652 and the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910.\n\nIn 1799, at the time of the first British occupation of the Colony during the Napoleonic Wars, British troops built a stone fort named Fort Frederick after the Duke of York. This fort, aiming to deter a possible landing of French troops, was constructed to oversee the site of what later became Port Elizabeth. The fort is now preserved as a monument.From 1814 to 1821 the Strandfontein farm was owned by Piet Retief. He later became a Voortrekker leader and was killed in 1837 by Zulu king Dingane during negotiations about land. An estimated 500 men, woman and children of his party were massacred. Frederik Korsten owned the Strandfontein farm after Retief. The suburb of Korsten was named after Frederick in the 19th century. This area was later developed as the Summerstrand beach suburb of Port Elizabeth.In 1820 a party of 4,000 British settlers arrived by sea, encouraged by the government of the Cape Colony to form a settlement to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa people. At this time the seaport town was founded by Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin, the Acting Governor of the Cape Colony (in office: 1820-1821). \nDiplomat Edmund Roberts visited Port Elizabeth in the early 1830s. Roberts noted that Port Elizabeth in the 1820s had \"contained four houses, and now it has upward of one hundred houses, and its residents are rated at above twelve hundred persons\".The Roman Catholic Church established the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope, Eastern District in the city in 1847. Port Elizabeth was granted the status of autonomous municipality in 1861. \nCape Colony Prime Minister John Molteno had formed the Cape Government Railways in 1872. Completion of the railway to Kimberley in 1873 was a major stimulus to trade and a rapid increase in population in the town. With the massive expansion of the Cape Colony's railway network to the interior over the following years, the harbour of Port Elizabeth became the focus for serving import and export needs of a large area of the Cape's hinterland. The rapid economic development around the port, which followed the railway construction, caused Port Elizabeth to be nicknamed \"the Liverpool of South Africa\", after a major British port. The town expanded as a diverse community, comprising Xhosa as well as European, Cape Malay, and other immigrants.\n\nDuring the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902, the port served as an important transit-point for British soldiers, horses, and materials headed by railway to the front. No armed conflict took place within the city, but it felt the effects of the war with the arrival of many refugees who moved into the city. These included Boer women and children, whom the British interned in a concentration camp. \nAfter the war, the British erected a monument to military horses that died during the war. \"The unveiling of the monument commemorating the services of the horses which perished during the Anglo Boer War, 1899-1902, took place on Saturday afternoon, February 11, 1905, with His Worship the Mayor, Mr A Fettes, performing the ceremony.\"\n\n\n=== Apartheid era ===\nUnder apartheid, the South African government established legal racial segregation and started programs to separate communities physically as well as by classification and custom. The forced relocation under the auspices of the Group Areas Act of the non-white population from mixed areas began in 1962, causing various townships to be built for their use. Classification was sometimes arbitrary, and as in many other localities throughout the country, many citizens appearing to have mixed ancestry were at times subject to re-classification, which often had intrusive sociopolitical results. The non-white tenants of South End, and land owners in Fairview were forcibly relocated from 1965 through to 1975, as these areas were valued as prime real estate. The city-planning was viewed as the prototypical apartheid city.\nAs black South Africans organized to try to achieve civil rights and social justice, government repression increased. In 1977 Steve Biko, the black anti-apartheid activist, was interrogated and tortured by the security police in Port Elizabeth before being transported to Pretoria, where he died. Other notable deaths in the city during this time included those of The Cradock Four, and of George Botha, a high-school teacher.\n\n\n==== 1952 Defiance Campaign ====\nIn 1952 the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress (SAIC) called all South Africans to stand up against the apartheid government's unjust laws directed at the black African, Indian and coloured population. On April 6, while most white South Africans celebrated the tercentenary of Jan van Riebeeck's arrival at the Cape in 1652, the ANC and SAIC called on black South Africans to observe the day as a \"A National Day of Pledge and Prayer\". 15 000 people attended in Johannesburg, 10 000 in Cape Town, 10 000 in Durban and 20 000 in Port Elizabeth. The meeting in Port Elizabeth was led by Professor Z. K. Matthews and by Raymond Mhlaba.\nOn 25 July 1952, a day before the official start of the Defiance Campaign, 30 volunteers led by Raymond Mhlaba gathered at the New Brighton Civic Centre and prayed throughout the night. At 5am on 26 July, they left the Civic Centre and walked towards the New Brighton Railway Station. In Raymond Mhlaba's Personal Memoirs: Reminiscing from Rwanda and Uganda, Mhlaba recalled:\n\n\"I led the very first group and we entered the 'Europeans Only' section of the New Brighton station. By half past six we were already in police vans on our way to jail. It turned out that my party (group) was the very first to defy unjust laws in the whole of South Africa. Little did we know that we were making history.\"\n\nMhlaba became the first man to be arrested during the campaign, while Florence Matomela was the first woman. 2 007 people were arrested in Port Elizabeth during the Defiance Campaign included Oom Gov (Govan Mbeki) and Vuyisile Mini. Other volunteers who emerged as key role players during the campaign included Nosipho Dastile, Nontuthuzelo Mabala, Lilian Diedricks and Veronica Sobukwe.\n\n\n==== 1985 Consumer Boycotts ====\nAfter the formation of the ANC-affiliated United Democratic Front in 1983, political consciousness in black townships grew. With numerous protests across the country and the massacre in Langa township near Uitenhage, Eastern Cape police presence had increased in South African townships. In Port Elizabeth townships, black South Africans demanded the integration of public institutions, the removal of troops from black townships, and the end of workplace discrimination. To launch an effective campaign to cripple the white-owned institutions of Port Elizabeth and to undermine the legitimacy of apartheid, several women suggested the idea of a consumer boycott to the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO) in May 1985. The economic boycott began on July 15, 1985, and received massive support in townships around Port Elizabeth. By September 1985, white business-owners became desperate and called on the government to meet the demands of black South Africans. In November the boycott was still hurting white businesses in Port Elizabeth greatly. The white South African government reached an agreement with PEBCO which stated that the boycott would halt until March 1986 if business owners arranged for the release of black leaders.In 1986, as the deal was approaching its end, the boycotters imposed a deadline of March 31, stating that the boycott would resume if the initial demands were not met. On March 11, the government unexpectedly banned two leaders, one of whom was Mkuseli Jack. However, on March 22, the ban was lifted by the decision of a Supreme Court Justice on the grounds that the government had given insufficient reasons. Jack ripped up the ban papers, and used the celebration as a way to represent the solidarity that the campaign required. As the demands of the boycotters were not met by March 31, the boycott was renewed on April 1. The boycott continued for nine weeks, but on June 12, 1986, another state of emergency was imposed by the National Party government. Security forces searched through the townships, arresting thousands and raiding the offices of black civics, trade unions, the UDF, the South African Council, and churches and also confiscating documents.\n\n\n=== Modern History ===\nWith the establishment of the  Coega Industrial Development Zone (CIDZ), foreign direct and also national-level investment has improved substantially in the region of Nelson Mandela Bay/Port Elizabeth. The IDZ, under the stewardship of the Coega Development Corporation (CDC), since inception has managed to attract to its investment account in excess of R140-billion into the economy of the Eastern Cape and has enabled the creation of over 45 000 jobs. This is significant for the sustainability of the IDZ, Nelson Mandela Bay, and the economy of the Eastern Cape. The CDC consistently continues to demonstrate its capability as the leading catalyst for socio-economic growth in the Eastern Cape, with a view to becoming so for South Africa.\nIn 2001 the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality was formed as an administrative area covering Port Elizabeth, the neighbouring towns of Uitenhage and Despatch and the surrounding agricultural areas. The name honours former President Nelson Mandela. The combined metropolitan area had a population estimated at around 1.3 million in 2006.\n\n\n==== 2010 FIFA World Cup ====\nOvertaking its next door neighbouring city East London, Port Elizabeth became the host city for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium hosted eight World Cup games were South Korea vs Greece, Ivory Coast vs Portugal, Germany vs Serbia; Chile vs Switzerland, Slovenia vs England in the Group Stage, then Uruguay, South Korea in the Round of 16. A quarter-final between Netherlands, Brazil was hosted, then for the Third Place playoff, Uruguay, Germany were hosted at the stadium. The World Cup was played between 11 June 2010 and 11 July 2010. Spain were the eventual champions.\n\n\n==== 2013 Africa Cup of Nations ====\nPort Elizabeth was also one of the five cities that hosted the 2013 Afcon event. Same stadium of 2010 World Cup hosted eight games: five matches of Group B included Ghana, DR Congo; Mali, Niger; Ghana, Mali; DR. Congo, Niger; Ghana, Niger; one match of Group A Cape Verde, Angola. Quarterfinal Ghana, Cape Verde, then Third Place playoff Ghana, Mali. The Africa Cup of Nations took place between 19 January and 10 February 2013. Nigeria were eventual champions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Port Elizabeth has an oceanic climate (Cfb\u202f). The area lies between the winter rainfall, Mediterranean climate zones of the Western Cape and the summer rainfall regions of eastern South Africa. Winters are cool but mild and summers are warm but considerably less humid and hot than more northerly parts of South Africa's east coast. The climate is very even throughout the year with extreme heat or moderate cold rare.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nPort Elizabeth represents a large percentage of South Africa's biological diversity and the city is a confluence point five of the seven South African biomes, namely the Thicket, Grassland, Nama-Karoo, Fynbos and Forest Biomes. A number of municipal nature reserves have been included in, and can be visited along the \u201cOutward Bound Route\u201d of the city. A mosaic of these 5 Biomes could be experienced in these reserves. The outward bound route is an eco-outdoor adventure and sports route incorporating walking and wildlife experiences. The aim of this route is to spread tourism to similar attractions along the route, leading to increased foot traffic and related benefits to these sites.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nAs a British colonial town, the city had a strongly British character, and the central area retains that to this day. Few of the buildings featured in this tour would be out of place in an English market town.  The colonial City Hall is a national monument. The Port Elizabeth main public library is an excellent example of Victorian Gothic architecture. Various memorials are situated throughout the city environs, and there are many tours available to familiarise visitors with especially the apartheid era. Port Elizabeth could be considered to be the country's leading centre of Art Nouveau style architecture due to its European heritage. Many buildings display the intricate stonework, wrought iron and stained glass of that era which are prominently visible in the Central Historical areas of the city. Combinations of Art Nouveau and Colonial styles are seen in residences along Cape Road.The area also boasts a collection of Cape Dutch style architecture as well as the Victorian and Edwardian styles, resulting from the arrival of the 1820 British settlers. Although influenced by Dutch architecture, the Cape Dutch style is unique to South Africa and examples can be seen all over the Eastern and Western Cape. \n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\nPort Elizabeth has numerous water features in its encompassing area.  There is a vast length of marine coastline on the city's outer encroachments particularly southwards. Beaches like Kings Beach, Hobie Beach, Bluewater Bay, Sardinia Bay, and the beaches along Marine Drive are abundant. Kings Beach is adjacent to Port Elizabeth's harbour, and the longshore drift from Cape Recife provides a plentiful supply of sea sand. On the north westerly coastline of Port Elizabeth, the contours tends to be rockier than the area between Cape Recife, and the Port of Ngqura. Port Elizabeth has a few rivers, of which the Baakens River is the most prominent. This river usually floods when a reasonable amount precipitation is observed, especially at low level crossings. North End Lake is the largest natural freshwater body in Port Elizabeth, but has experienced a form of contamination from industry. (It is not recommended to ingest anything from this lake) Also, numerous smaller \"lakes\" are in the surrounding area, namely Lake Farm.  Port Elizabeth (as a whole, the entire Eastern Cape) is experiencing a devastating drought, of which a disaster has been declared by the current office bearers of the greater municipality. Water restrictions are in place, and measures are in place to provide enough water in the near future, namely freshwater treatment works being constructed to acquire additional water from the Gariep Dam.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPort Elizabeth is the most populous city in the Eastern Cape. In 2001:\nArea: 335.3 square kilometres (129.5 sq mi)\nPopulation: 237,502: 708.32 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,834.5/sq mi)\nHouseholds: 70,606: 210.58 per square kilometre (545.4/sq mi)\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Trade and industry ===\nThe largest economic sectors in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro are manufacturing, finance, community services and transport. Community services, trade and manufacturing sectors are the sectors that create the most employment in the Metro. The city offers a wealth of tourism and recreation opportunity due to its biodiversity, beaches and open spaces.  Further still, Nelson Mandela Bay is a preferred region for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, flour, meat, frozen veggies, soft drinks, chocolates, cheese, yoghurt, ice-cream, paper and leather products.Historically, the majority of trade in the region came through Port Elizabeth. In the 1830s, at least five ships regularly transported goods to Europe. It became a free port in 1832. In 1833, about 50 vessels had moved through the port. In 1828, 55,201 pounds, (25038 kg), of goods were imported through the port, increasing by 1832 to 112,845 pounds, (51185 kg), imported in that year. Port Elizabeth exported 41,290 pounds, (18738 kg), in 1828, with a large increase to 86,931 pounds, (39431 kg), goods exported in 1829. Exports included wine, brandy, vinegar, ivory, hides and skins, leather, tallow, butter, soap, wool, ostrich feathers, salted beef, wheat, candles, aloe, barley, and more.Home of South Africa's motor vehicle industry, Port Elizabeth boasts most vehicle assembly plants, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Continental Tyres and many other automotive-related companies. As of 2018, after GM's exit from Port Elizabeth and South Africa, Isuzu took over their production plant in Struandale. In 2016, Chinese state-owned automotive manufacturer BAIC and South Africa's Industrial Development Corporation announced a R11 billion joint venture for the establishment of a semi knock down vehicle assembly plant in Coega.  It is anticipated that the plant will go online in 2020.  The FAW also have built a multi-billion rand plant in the region. Most other industries in Port Elizabeth are geared towards the motor vehicle industry, providing parts such as wiring harnesses, catalytic converters, batteries and tyres to the vehicle manufacturers.\nPort Elizabeth is also a major seaport, with the most significant car loading facilities in the southern hemisphere. As part of the ongoing development, a new Industrial Development Zone with expanded port facilities has been built at Coega.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nLocated at the end of the picturesque Garden Route along the Cape coast, the city has beaches in and near it. The most popular swimming beaches include King's Beach and Hobie Beach.\nMany local historic attractions are linked by the Donkin Heritage Trail. These include the Campanile (bell tower), built in 1923 to commemorate the arrival of the 1820 Settlers and offering a viewpoint over the city; the city hall (1862); the Donkin Reserve park and monument; and the old stone Fort Frederick itself (1799). The CBD also boasts the towering Eastern Cape post office headquarters.\nRoute 67 is a walking trail consisting of 67 public artworks, symbolising 67 years which Nelson Mandela dedicated to the freedom of South Africa. The artwork is a celebration of South African culture and history and is scattered along the route as it starts from the Campanile, up the stairs to the Vuysile Mini Market Square and to the large South African flag at the Donkin Reserve. The artworks were created by local Eastern Cape artists.Other attractions include the gardens at St George's Park, the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum (formerly known as the King George VI Art Gallery), the museum and oceanography room at Humewood, and the new Boardwalk waterfront complex.\nThe wider area surrounding PE also features game viewing opportunities, including the Addo Elephant National Park, 72 kilometres (45 mi) to the north near the Zuurberg mountain range.\nPort Elizabeth is also a destination for whale watching with humpback whales sighted between June and August, and again between November and January, southern right whales sighted between July and November, and Bryde's whales sighted all year round.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe biggest sporting events in Port Elizabeth, is the annual Ironman triathlon and the Herald Cycle tour. The Tuna classic deep-sea fishing competition attracts anglers from all over the world.\nThe city has facilities catering for cricket, rugby union, athletics, association football, field hockey and many other sports. Its coastal location also makes it a base for many watersports.\nPort Elizabeth is the location of the St George's Park cricket ground, which holds test cricket matches. St George's Park is the oldest cricket ground in South Africa, and was the venue for the first Test match played outside of Australia or England, between South Africa and England on 12 and 13 March 1889. The Warriors, a franchise cricket team in South Africa, is based in Port Elizabeth. The stadium is also known for its band that entertains fans at the Proteas games.\nThe headquarters of the Southern Spears rugby franchise was in Port Elizabeth. The long-standing Eastern Province Rugby Union, now commonly known as the Eastern Province Elephants, formed the basis of the Spears franchise together with East London's Border Bulldogs. The remnants of the Spears were later reconstituted into the Southern Kings, also based in Port Elizabeth, which joined Super Rugby in 2013. The Southern Kings did not participate in Super Rugby in 2014 or 2015, and returned to Super Rugby in 2016, 2017, but were dropped for economical reasons by SARU. The team now competes in the Guinness Pro14. The Eastern Province Rugby Union play their home matches at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, built for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn December 2011, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium became the new home of the South Africa Sevens, the country's leg of the annual IRB Sevens World Series in rugby sevens. The event had previously been held in three other cities, most recently in George in the Western Cape from 2002 to 2010. As of 2015, is hosted annually in Cape Town, in the Western Cape.\nThe city's main football club is Chippa United, they currently use the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium as their home ground. Previous clubs to play in the country's top tier were Bay United, Michau Warriors, Port Elizabeth Blackpool, Hotspur F.C., Port Elizabeth City and Westview Apollon.\nThe Algoa Bay Yacht Club operates out of the Port of Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n== Government ==\nPort Elizabeth had its own municipality from 1843 to 2000.  Since then, it has formed part of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, and serves as the seat for the surrounding Cacadu District Municipality. It has a Magistrate's Court, a local seat of the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court, and a branch of the Labour Court. As a result of the presence of a High Court, several other related organs of state such as a Masters Office and a Director of Public Prosecutions are present in the city.\nAll Government (mostly provincial) departments maintain branches or other offices in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe Port Elizabeth municipality assumed a coat of arms on 9 January 1878.  The design, prepared by Bradbury Wilkinson and Company (of London), was a simplified version of the arms of Sir Rufane Donkin : Gules,  on a chevron Argent between two cinquefoils in chief and a bugle horn stringed in base Or, three buckles Sable;  a chief embattled Argent thereon an elephant statant proper.  The crest was a sailing ship, and the motto In meliora spera.\n(In layman's terms : a red shield displaying, from top to bottom, an elephant on a silver horizontal strip whose lower edge is embattled, two gold cinquefoils, a silver chevron bearing three black buckles, and a gold bugle horn.)\nEighty years later, in 1958, the council made slight changes to the arms, and had them granted by the College of Arms.  The changes consisted of adding two anchors to the chief of the shield, placing a red mural crown bearing three golden rings below the ship in the crest, and changing the motto to Tu meliora spera.  The arms were registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in 1959, and at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1986.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University Level ===\nThe Nelson Mandela University was formed by the amalgamation of the University of Port Elizabeth, Port Elizabeth Technikon, and the Port Elizabeth campus of Vista University. It is the largest university in the Eastern and Southern Cape, with around 29,000 students in seven faculties spread over seven campuses.\nRussell Road College and AFDA also have campuses in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== High School Level ===\nThe city has a number of top government-funded and private schools, although the abuse of substances seems to prevail in some schools due to a lack of drug prevention training on the part of the educational system, including Alexander Road High School, Collegiate Girls' High School, Victoria Park High School, Grey High School, Pearson High School, Woodridge College, Andrew Rabie High School and Lawson Brown High School.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nPort Elizabeth lies on the N2 road. To the west the road travels the Garden Route to George and Cape Town; to the east, the road runs through the Border Country through Makhanda, to East London then on to Durban, terminating in Ermelo in Mpumalanga. The R75 connects Port Elizabeth to the Karoo. The major routes within the city are numbered as metropolitan or M routes.\nThe city's main bus station is in Market Square. The public bus service is run by the Algoa Bus Company.  Between 1881 and 1948, there was a Port Elizabeth tramway network, powered initially by horses, and later by electricity.\nThe city is in the process of building a bus rapid transit system which was intended for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This has been a massive failure as local taxi associations have prevented the implementation. Port Elizabeth lacks a proper public transport system which has had a negative impact on the poorer residents of the city who are dependent on public transport. Construction of the bus rapid transit network has been suspended due to mismanagement which led to the project missing its May 2010 deadline. Calls for the project, which has left many parts of the city in a permanent state of construction, have been made recently, and it is expected that the government will make a decision on the matter soon.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nPort Elizabeth railway station is served by South Africa's rail network. Local commuter services are operated by Metrorail, while the Shosholoza Meyl long-distance passenger service links PE with Johannesburg via Bloemfontein where it is possible to connect with other long-distance routes.The Apple Express narrow-gauge tourist train to Avontuur operated from the separate station in Humewood Road near King's Beach. It departed regularly for Thornhill Village via Van Stadens River bridge, the highest narrow-gauge rail bridge in the world. The Apple Express was launched to provide a service to transport fresh produce and wood from the farms along the line to Avontuur. The line was completed in 1914 and the train delivered produce directly from the farms to ships in the Port Elizabeth Harbour. Due to modern transport methods such as containerisation, and refrigerated containers and trucks, the Apple Express and its services became redundant. Service has now ceased.\nIn preparation for the 2010 World Cup Soccer event the Humerail Station was extensively upgraded. Several disused narrow gauge goods wagons were scrapped and removed from the site, several buildings in the area have also been renovated and revamped.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nPort Elizabeth Airport (IATA airport code PLZ, ICAO airport code FAPE) serves the city for both passenger and cargo traffic. It is the fourth busiest airport in South Africa after O.R. Tambo International Airport, King Shaka International Airport in Durban, and Cape Town International Airport.\nInternational visitors to the city must currently fly to either Johannesburg, Cape Town or Durban, and then take a domestic flight to Port Elizabeth. An upgrade to the terminal building, completed in 2004, created the necessary facilities to handle international flights although none are scheduled as yet.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nPort Elizabeth has a harbour in Algoa Bay, and the construction of an additional international harbour at Coega has supported an increase in the size of the city's industries and the addition of new industries.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city has government-funded and private hospitals, including:\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nPort Elizabeth is served by a few radio outlets, namely Algoa FM, Umhlobo Wenene FM (radio broadcasting to the residents of Port Elizabeth, as well as the entire Eastern Cape, and Garden Route, and globally, online.)\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nThe Herald serves the English populace in terms of newspaper, on a daily basis. Die Burger serves the Afrikaans communities as well with a well established readership base.\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nThere are various social media news groups in Port Elizabeth, which is used at most as neighbourhood watch groups.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe SABC has a regional office in Port Elizabeth.  Bay TV is a free-to-air station established by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality that broadcasts 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. The station focusses on African story-telling and creating platforms for local content creators, and receives funding from local government and corporate donors.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n Beira, Mozambique\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nRed Location Museum\nList of heritage sites in Port Elizabeth\nFort Frederick, Eastern Cape\nBloemendal\nNational Monument\nVictorian era\nDonkin Heritage Trail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPort Elizabeth of Yore: The Defiance Campaign of 1952",

        "wiki": "The Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta, or California Delta, is an expansive inland river delta and estuary in Northern California. The Delta is formed at the western edge of the Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and lies just east of where the rivers enter Suisun Bay. The Delta is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy. Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta was designated a National Heritage Area on March 12, 2019. The city of Stockton is located on the San Joaquin River on the eastern edge of the delta. The total area of the Delta, including both land and water, is about 1,100 square miles (2,800 km2). Its population is around 500,000 residents.The Delta was formed by the raising of sea level following glaciation, leading to the accumulation of Sacramento and San Joaquin River sediments behind the Carquinez Strait, the sole outlet from the Central Valley to the San Pablo and San Francisco Bays and the Pacific Ocean. The narrowness of the Carquinez Strait coupled with tidal action has caused the sediment to pile up, forming expansive islands. Geologically, the Delta has existed for about 10,000 years, since the end of the Last Glacial Period. In its natural state, the Delta was a large freshwater marsh, consisting of many shallow channels and sloughs surrounding low islands of peat and tule.\nSince the mid-19th century, most of the region has been gradually claimed for agriculture. Wind erosion and oxidation have led to widespread subsidence on the Central Delta islands; much of the Delta region today sits below sea level, behind levees earning it the nickname \"California's Holland\". Much of the water supply for Central California and Southern California is also derived from the Delta, via pumps located at the southern end of the Delta. The pumps deliver water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley and municipal water supply for Southern California.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Delta consists of approximately 57 reclaimed islands and tracts but there are nearly 200 islands in the delta that are named or not named. These are all surrounded by 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of levees that border 700 miles (1,100 km) of waterways. The southwestern side of the Delta lies at the foothills of the California Coast Ranges, while to the northwest sit the lower Montezuma Hills. Most of the Delta lies within Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano and Yolo Counties. The total human population of the Delta was 515,264 as of 2000.Altogether, the Delta covers 1,153 square miles (2,990 km2), with 841 sq mi (2,180 km2), or nearly 73 percent, devoted to agriculture. About 100 sq mi (260 km2) of the Delta area is urban and 117 sq mi (300 km2) are undeveloped land. The rivers, streams, sloughs and waterways of the Delta total about 95 sq mi (250 km2) of surface, although this fluctuates greatly with seasons and tides. Geologically, it is not considered a true river delta, but rather an inverted river delta, as it formed inward (sediments accumulating progressively inland) rather than outward. The only other major river delta in the world located this far inland is the Pearl River Delta in China.The main source rivers include the Sacramento River from the north, the San Joaquin from the southeast, and the Calaveras and Mokelumne Rivers from the east. The Calaveras and Mokelumne are both tributaries of the San Joaquin River. The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers join at the western end of the Delta near Pittsburg, at the head of Suisun Bay, although they are linked upstream by the Georgiana Slough, which was first used by steamboats in the 19th century as a shortcut between Sacramento and Stockton.  The southwestern part of the Delta is also transected by the Middle River and Old River, former channels of the San Joaquin. These rivers transport more than 30 million acre feet (8.9 cu mi; 37 km3) of water through the Delta each year \u2013 about 50 percent of all California's runoff.Nearby cities include Lodi and Stockton to the east, Tracy and Manteca to the south, Brentwood to the southwest, and Pittsburg and Antioch to the west. The state capital, Sacramento, is located just to the north of the Delta.The Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel connects the Delta to the Port of Sacramento, with its terminus located near Rio Vista, on the northwestern side of the Delta. The Stockton Ship Channel is a dredged and partially straightened section of the San Joaquin River cutting directly through the Delta from the Port of Stockton to the San Joaquin's confluence with the Sacramento near Antioch.\n\n\n== Geology, formation and natural conditions ==\n\nThe Delta was formerly located at the bottom of a large inland sea in the Central Valley, which formed as the uplift of the California Coast Ranges blocked off drainage from the Sierra Nevada to the Pacific. About 560,000 years ago, water breached the mountains, carving out the present-day Carquinez Strait and San Francisco Bay. The drainage of all the water through this narrow gap formed a bottleneck in the Central Valley's outflow; this constriction is essential to provoke the slowing of river current and the resulting sediment deposits that now make up the Delta.The Delta in its contemporary (pre-1850s) state began to form about 10,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age. During the Ice Age global sea levels were about 300 ft (91 m) lower than today, and the Delta region, as well as Suisun Bay, the Carquinez Strait and San Francisco Bay, were a river valley through which the continuation of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers flowed to the Pacific Ocean. When sea levels rose again, ocean water backed up through the Carquinez Strait into the Central Valley; the combination of the narrow strait and tidal action pushing inland dramatically slowed the current of these rivers and forced them to drop sediment.  The early delta was composed of shifting channels, sand dunes, alluvial fans and floodplains that underwent constant fluctuation because of rapidly rising seas \u2013 one inch (25 mm) per year. About 8,000 years ago, the rate of sea-level rise slackened, allowing wetland plants to take hold in the Delta, trapping sediment; the growth and decay of these plants began to form the vast peat deposits that make up the Delta islands. The Delta reached a stabilized form similar to its mid-1800s state about 2,000\u20133,000 years ago.\n\nImmediately before large-scale human development, most of the Delta islands had saucer-like cross sections, with low natural levees flanking a marshy interior \"bowl\" that flooded intermittently with the seasons and tides. The height of these natural levees, formed from overbank deposits of sediments deposited by annual river floods, ranged from one foot (0.30 m) above mean high tide at Sherman Island on the Sacramento River, to seven to eight feet (2.1 to 2.4 m) at Andrus, Staten and Tyler Islands, located further east near the Mokelumne River. An estimated 60 percent of the Delta flooded for up to two hours each day at high tide; during spring tides or river floods, it was not uncommon for the entire Delta to be under water.\n\n\n== History ==\nHumans have inhabited the Delta for up to 4,300 years. The estimated indigenous population of the Delta at the time of first contact with Europeans was about 3,000\u201315,000, predominantly Miwok and Maidu, with some estimates ranging up to 20,000. The Native Americans lived in villages of 200\u20131,000 people on the eastern edge of the Delta, where the land was higher and less susceptible to flooding. Their lives centered around the abundant reeds or tules that grew on the Delta islands, which they used to make houses, boats, and garments. Staple foods included tule roots and pollen, acorns, wild fruits and seeds, fish and game.Europeans first entered the Delta region in 1772, when Spanish explorer Don Pedro Fages and missionary Juan Cresp\u00ed observed the Delta from the summit of nearby Mount Diablo. For decades, the Delta was little utilized by the Spanish colonists. Expeditions from 1806\u20131812 failed to locate suitable mission sites in the Delta area. However, frequent military expeditions were made into the Delta from 1813\u20131845 in response to animosities between the Native Americans and the Spanish and later Mexicans; also several land grants were made in the vicinity of the Delta, including one to John Augustus Sutter, who started the first significant European settlement in the Central Valley just north of the Delta near present-day Sacramento.\n\nThe Spanish conscripted large numbers of Native Americans for labor on missions; many Native Americans fled deep into the Delta in order to escape their European masters. However, this did not protect them from diseases. A malaria epidemic in 1833 decimated local native populations; this was probably exacerbated by the marshy geography of the area, which bred large amounts of mosquitoes.The agricultural value of the Delta was first recognized during the California Gold Rush, when farmers planted orchards on Delta islands to provide fresh fruit for mining camps in the Sierra Nevada. Because of the flat terrain coupled with year-round availability of fresh water, irrigation here was cheaper and simpler than other fertile regions of California. As a result, the Delta remained California's richest farming region (alongside Los Angeles County) until the 1940s, when massive federal water projects finally made possible the full-scale irrigation of the main body of the Central Valley. Today, the Delta is still among the state's most productive farming regions.In 1850, Congress passed the Arkansas or Swampland Act, which allowed for the transfer of title for wetlands to private owners on the conditions that the land would be reclaimed. In California, more than two million acres (3,100 sq mi; 8,100 km2) of wetlands were partitioned under the Swampland Act, of which 500,000 acres (780 sq mi; 2,000 km2) were in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, roughly the same amount of land that has been developed to date. Agricultural interests in the Delta were protected by the building of levees, a colossal effort first undertaken by Chinese laborers from the 1850s to the 1870s. The Board of Reclamation, formed in 1861, collectivized levee construction in the Delta by grouping islands into areas known as reclamation districts. The early levees were built of peat, and were highly susceptible to wind and water erosion. The Great Flood of 1862 obliterated much of the existing Delta infrastructure, forcing landowners to rebuild their levees higher and stronger; more flooding in 1878 and 1881 reinforced these notions.Although land holdings in the Delta were initially limited to 320 acres (0.50 sq mi; 1.3 km2) per buyer, this limit was repealed in 1868, allowing large agricultural conglomerates to take entire islands and carry out massive reclamation projects. From 1868\u20131869, the entirety of Sherman Island, some 14,000 acres (22 sq mi; 57 km2), was diked and drained by a system of levees, flumes and floodgates. By the 1890s, the original levee system had been largely replaced with stronger embankments consisting of clay dredged from nearby river bottoms. By 1900, about 235,000 acres (367 sq mi; 950 km2), or nearly half of the Delta's land area, had been reclaimed. Most of the farmable land in the Delta had been reclaimed by the 1920s.\n\n\n== Economy and human use ==\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nThe Delta produces crops valued at about $650 million annually (for the 1998\u20132004 period), making it one of the most productive farming regions of the United States in terms of crop value per unit area. Agriculture provides secondary benefits of over $2 billion to the local economy. Major crops grown in the Delta include corn, grain, hay, sugar beets, alfalfa, tomatoes, asparagus, and safflower; various fruits are also raised here, as well as some livestock. Crops in the Delta cannot be irrigated using conventional methods due to the highly absorbent quality of the peat soil and irregularities caused by land subsidence. Irrigation is typically carried out periodically by piping water into small \"spud ditches\", which spread water over large areas and raise the local water table. The heightened groundwater is then gradually depleted by the crop until irrigation is required again.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nDelta waterways are also major transportation corridors for agricultural products; the ports of Sacramento and Stockton, located on the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, respectively, are the most important inland ports in California. The San Joaquin River throughout most of the Delta and the lower Sacramento River below its connection to the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel are routinely dredged to allow the passage of large cargo ships. The Sacramento River corridor has been maintained to a depth of 7 ft (2.1 m) as early as 1899, and was deepened to 30 ft (9.1 m) in 1955. The Stockton Ship Channel has been dredged since 1913; however, its present depth of 37 ft (11 m) was only achieved in 1987. The Delta is also home to the port of Benicia, an automobile and bulk shipping facility. Petroleum is shipped to both the Benicia Refinery and the Martinez Refinery by water. Nearby is the Port Chicago Marine Ocean Terminal, a facility that supports the U.S. Navy.\n\n\n=== Water supply ===\n\nThe Delta is often considered the nexus of California's statewide water system. About half the total river flow in the state passes through this region, from which water is exported to the San Joaquin Valley, Southern California and portions of the Bay area to supply some 1,130,000 acres (1,770 sq mi; 4,600 km2) of farmland and 23 million people in central and Southern California. The Delta provides an estimated seven million acre feet (2.1 cu mi; 8.6 km3) of water per year, of which about 100,000 acre feet (0.030 cu mi; 0.12 km3) are exported to the San Francisco Bay Area, 1.7 million acre feet (0.50 cu mi; 2.1 km3) are used locally, and over five million acre feet (1.5 cu mi; 6.2 km3) are exported to the San Joaquin Valley, coastal Central and Southern California.Intrusion of brackish water into the Delta is a recurring natural phenomenon; however, it became a serious issue after the development of agriculture in the upper Sacramento and San Joaquin valley reduced inflows. Multiple droughts between 1910 and 1940 caused significant salinity intrusion in the Delta because of the reduction of freshwater inflows. The growing Delta water quality issue provided the initial impetus for building dams on Central Valley rivers to boost dry-season freshwater flows. This eventually became the federal Central Valley Project (CVP), California's first major statewide water system, most of which was built between the 1930s and the 1960s.Today, the California Aqueduct and the Delta-Mendota Canal, two of the state's largest water conveyance facilities, both draw water from the southern end of the Delta at the Clifton Court Forebay. Built in the mid-twentieth century, the former supplies water to the Los Angeles Basin and coastal central California via the State Water Project; the latter, a part of the CVP, provides supplies of irrigation water in the fertile San Joaquin Valley. Although the vast majority of water supplied by these projects is used for agriculture and urban areas, some water is also provided for wildlife refuges and habitat conservation works. The Contra Costa Canal and North Bay Aqueduct also take Delta water, supplying the nearby San Francisco Bay Area. Locally, the Delta provides water for cities and towns in five counties and for over 1,800 agricultural users.\n\n\n=== Recreation ===\nThe Delta is also a popular site for recreation and is used for sailing, waterskiing, houseboating, fishing, and hunting. The Delta is home to over 100 marinas and 25 yacht clubs. In 2010, over seven million 'annual visitor boating days' occurred on the Delta, according to a local government survey.The Delta is home to several state and regional parks, reflecting a variety of recreational activities. These include historical interpretative centers, including Delta Meadows and Locke Boarding House and the Old Sacramento State Historic Park. The Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial offers visitors a chance to learn about the disaster that represented the largest domestic loss of life in the U.S. in World War II, and the impact it had on race relations in the U.S. military.\nBrannan Island State Recreation Area offers boat launches and facilities that support fishing, windsurfing, waterskiing, and sailing, in addition to campsites, picnic areas and trails to allow visitors to explore the marshes and islands of the area.Originally a Delta farming island, Franks Tract flooded in 1936 and again in 1938. The levees were never repaired and the island remained submerged, becoming an expanse of open water dotted with remnants of the original levees now the only landforms. In 1959, the area became a state park. Franks Tract State Recreation Area is accessible only by water and is used for fishing, waterfowl hunting, and boating.The Pacific Flyway, a north-south route for migratory birds, crosses the Delta. The migratory birds provide both birdwatching and hunting opportunities. Including the northern Suisun Marsh, there are over 150 private duck clubs in the area.\n\n\n== Effects of the levee system and freshwater diversion ==\n\nThe levee system allowed farmers to drain and reclaim almost 500,000 acres (780 sq mi; 2,000 km2) of the Delta, then a tidal marsh. Once the rivers were confined to their riverbeds, the peat soil of the former tidal marsh was exposed to oxygen. As the oxygen-rich peat soil decomposed and then released carbon dioxide, profound subsidence of the land resulted, of up to 25 feet since the late 1800s.Currently, most of the Delta is below sea level, with a great deal of the western and central Delta at least 15 feet (4.6 m) below sea level. The California Department of Water Resources has experimented with re-flooding areas for wetland restoration, in order to sequester carbon and rebuild soil levels.Land subsidence has endangered the Delta's system of protective levees, occasionally triggering levee failure and subsequent flooding.\n\nLand subsidence also allows brackish water intrusion into the Delta, an issue compounded by the diversion of up to 25% of the freshwater flowing into the Delta. The decreased volume of freshwater in the Delta has had a profound effect on its ecology. In most years, large dams in the Delta watershed fully hold back spring runoff; as a result the Delta is most susceptible to salinity intrusion between February and June. However, regulation provided by dams helps boost freshwater flows during dry summers and autumns, reducing the risk of salinity intrusion in these months.Diversions located at the southern end of the Delta, however, have negated some of the benefits of upstream dams. The powerful pumps that supply water for the Central Valley Project and State Water Project cause water in the Delta to flow from north to south instead of the natural direction of east to west. This has caused multiple environmental issues, such as the disruption of fish migration and salinity buildup in the eastern Delta, where salts can no longer be flushed to the sea by natural river flows.\n\n\n== Levee failures ==\n\nSince 1900, there have been over 160 levee failures in the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta. These numbers include multiple failures of a single levee structure. Levee failures, also known as breaches, can be caused by overtopping or structural failure.  One of the most recent examples of levee failure in the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta occurred in June 2004 when a levee breach caused more than 150,000 acre feet (190,000,000 m3) of water to flood the entire island of Jones Tract.But, the significant improvements made to the Delta levee system since 1982 have reduced the incidence of failures to this one major failure in 30 years.  The most up-to-date description and discussion of the Delta levee system can be found in the Economic Sustainability Plan of the Delta Protection Commission. This study concluded that the Delta levee system is now relatively robust but should be improved to effectively eliminate the risk of failure in extreme floods and earthquakes. It emphasizes the significant value of the infrastructure that passes through the Delta, including water conveyance, in addition to life and property, and the value of the Delta as a Place.A 2019 article states that \"a catastrophic levee failure, defined as 20 islands flooding at once, has a 62 percent chance of occurring in the next two decades if subsidence isn\u2019t addressed.\"Simultaneous levee failures on the Delta's 57 islands in the wake of an earthquake which allow the inflow of brackish San Francisco Bay waters could threaten the water supply for the Central Valley, which includes both the irrigation water for its $17 billion agricultural economy and the drinking water for about 25 million people.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAbout 500 plant and animal species inhabit the Delta, which is one of the largest estuaries in western North America. Before agricultural development of the Delta region, the Delta's many islands were forested by Tule, bulrush, and various reeds that flourished in intermittently flooded, low-lying marshy areas. Over thousands of years, the growth and decay of the various swampland plants formed a layer of peat 50 feet (15 m) deep in places, hence the extremely high fertility of Delta soils. Sediment deposits formed natural levees around the borders of islands, where larger trees, mainly willows, were able to take root and form large riparian forests. The riparian forests were most pronounced along the Sacramento River and the lower Mokelumne River below its confluence with the Cosumnes River. More extensive woodlands were prominent on the fringes of the Delta bordering the riparian zones. Composed primarily of valley oak, box elder and Oregon ash, these oak woodlands grew in bands that stretched up to 3 miles (4.8 km) inland. Farther away from water sources, vegetation gave way to grassland. The water Hyacinth has become one of the most destructive plants to the Delta water way. Within one year it will spread and cover as much as 6,500 square feet (600 m2) of water space in one growing season. It has become a challenge to the agricultural community to eliminate. The plants spread by budding and spreading its seeds, and those seeds fall to the bottom of the water, where they can stay viable in the muck for years. The Hyacinth can form a mat up to 6 feet (1.8 m) thick, shutting off light and becoming acidic when they decompose.\n\nThe Delta was formerly populated by large herds of deer and tule elk; their trails were so vast that early Spanish explorers supposed the area was inhabited by cattle. Significant numbers of California grizzly bears could also be found in the Delta. The extensive wetlands of the Delta supported massive bird populations, even today, half the migrating waterfowl in California still pass through the Delta. A survey in 2012 recorded a spring duck population of 48.6 million, the highest since counts began in 1955. Large mammals in the Delta have not fared so well; with most of their habitat converted to agriculture, remaining populations were highly susceptible to human impacts and natural disasters. Grizzlies were hunted to extinction, while the flood of 1878 wiped out the last of the elk herds in the Delta.The Delta is home to approximately 22 species of fish, including several Pacific salmon species, striped bass, steelhead trout, American shad and sturgeon. About two-thirds of California's salmon pass through the Delta on their way upstream to spawn. The small Delta smelt is a key indicator species for the health of the Delta's ecosystem. Delta fish populations have been significantly reduced due to the reclamation of marshland and diversions of fresh water. In 2004, the Delta smelt was found to be on the edge of extinction. The survival of the Delta smelt has been one of the largest environmental controversies in California, as environmental measures enacted to protect its population have often reduced the amount of water available for federal water projects that depend on water pumped from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught in Central and South parts of the Delta due to elevated levels of mercury and PCBs. In addition, there is a notice of \"DO NOT EAT\" for any fish or shellfish from the Port of Stockton. There is a separated safe eating advisory for the Northern part of the Delta.\nNutria were found in Merced County in 2017 on the edge of the Delta. State officials are concerned that they will harm the infrastructure that sends water to San Joaquin Valley farms and urban areas.\n\n\n== Conservation efforts ==\n\nAfter numerous rounds of mitigation following the 2005 Smelt Biological Opinion (BiOp) lead to pumping restrictions from the State and Federal projects from the Delta, a number of potential solutions to the Delta's problems have been proposed. These followed the CALFED process which had offered several staged solutions. A first set of alternatives would maintain the Delta in its current condition and configuration.  The second would restore parts of the Delta more closely to its natural state but include the construction of an additional Peripheral Canal to maintain the water supply currently provided by the Delta.\n\nThe Contra Costa County Public Works Department is working with the California Coastal Commission and the Department of Boating and Waterways to protect the drinking water quality, prevent pollution, and promote the environmental health of the Delta.In April 2009, the Sacramento River in the Delta was declared the nation's most endangered waterway system by the environmental group American Rivers, due to water shortages caused by the Delta's environmental problems, declining fish populations and aging levees, among other problems.Since the 1940s, various groups have lobbied for the construction of a Peripheral Canal to redirect water flowing from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers directly to the federal aqueducts that draw water from the southern end of the Delta. Currently, freshwater entering the Delta has to flow through a maze of river channels and sloughs before entering the Clifton Court Forebay north of Tracy, where water is pumped into the California Aqueduct and Delta-Mendota Canal. In addition, large numbers of Delta smelt and other endangered species are killed by the pumping plants that provide water for the aqueducts.The current proposal, known as the Bay Delta Conservation Plan, entails building twin tunnels under the delta and is closely associated with Governor Jerry Brown. However, the Peripheral Canal proposal has been criticized because it would further reduce the amount of freshwater flowing through the Delta. Farmers in the Delta are among the most opposed to the project because it would decrease the amount of water available to them for irrigation.All solutions, however, aim to produce a Delta which simultaneously supports a vibrant ecosystem and continues to supply fresh water to the Central Valley Project, the State Water Project and the Bay Area.Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area was designated on March 12, 2019, the first such designation for California, as part of the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act. The Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area is managed by the Delta Protection Commission.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area\nBig Break Regional Shoreline\nCALFED Bay-Delta Program\nJohn P.

        "wiki": "Port Elizabeth International Airport (IATA: PLZ, ICAO: FAPE) is an airport serving Port Elizabeth, a city in the Eastern Cape province in South Africa. It was formerly known as H. F. Verwoerd Airport. The airport is owned and operated by the Airports Company South Africa which also operates nine other airports around South Africa. The airport is located approximately two miles south of the city's central business district. In 2017, the airport served 1,620,705 passengers.\n\n\n== History ==\nA highlight in Port Elizabeth's history was the first flight to Port Elizabeth from Cape Town in 1917, made by Major Allister Mackintosh Miller. At that time, this was considered a long distance flight, and it heralded the start of the civil aviation industry in Port Elizabeth. This flight and many more has been captured on canvas by Ron Belling and is on display at the Ron Belling Art Gallery.\nPort Elizabeth Airport was established in 1929 in close proximity to the city. It was initially founded by Lieutenant Colonel Miller, who needed an airfield to operate his postal service between the city and Cape Town. It was only officially opened some nine years later, in 1936, boasting a single runway, one hangar and a concrete apron. However, the foundations of this infrastructure will be removed to make room for additional vehicle parking.\nDuring World War II, the airfield was extended to accommodate 42 Air School for the Royal Air Force and 6 Squadron South African Air Force on the southern and eastern sides of the field. Commercial operations were conducted from the northern side. In 1954, it saw the landing of the first jet-propelled aircraft - five De Havilland Vampire FB9s.\nConstruction of the permanent terminal buildings, runways and an air traffic control building began in 1950. The commercial operation was moved to an airfield at St Albans, some 25 km from the city centre, for the construction period. The new buildings were officially opened in 1955. In 1973 the apron was extended to accommodate larger aircraft and a new departures terminal was opened in 1980. The facilities served the airport community until 2000 when plans for a major terminal upgrade were drawn.\nThese facilities served the community till 2000 when plans for a major terminal upgrade was drawn-up. The separate arrivals and departures buildings were consolidated into a single facility with a central retail area linking the departures with arrivals creating a light friendly atmosphere. This facility caters for domestic flights but can be screened off to operate a fully compliant International arrivals and departures section.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nThe airport resides at an elevation of 226 feet (69 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 08/26 is 1,980 by 46 metres (6,496 ft \u00d7 151 ft) and 17/35 is 1,677 by 46 metres (5,502 ft \u00d7 151 ft). There are also 13 aircraft parking bays on the apron and the terminal building measures 8,700 square metres (94,000 sq ft). The modern terminal upgrade was completed in June 2004 allowing the airport to handle up to 2 million passengers a year. In preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup runway 08/26 was going to be extended from 1,980m to 3,000m with a view to accommodating International flights, although this never happened. A number of hotels are present on or near the airport. Ground transport is provided by local taxis. The airport also has a selection of parking areas and several car rental offices, including Eurocar and Bidvest.\n\n\n=== South African Air Force ===\nAir Force Station Port Elizabeth is home to C Flight of 15 Squadron of the South African Air Force. It is a helicopter unit primarily tasked with maritime and landward search and rescue. There is also a branch of the South African Air Force Museum at the airport. The museum houses many historical military jets, helicopters, exhibits and paintings dating from the airport's days a World War II base to the end of apartheid.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passengers ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Traffic statistics ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of airports in South Africa\nList of South African airports by passenger movements\nSouth African Air Force Museum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Port Elizabeth Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nPort Elizabeth International Airport, official site\nOperation Puff Adder, a simulated air disaster at PE Airport\nAeronautical chart for FAPE at SkyVector\nCurrent weather for FAPE at NOAA/NWS\nAccident history for PLZ at Aviation Safety Network",

        "wiki": "Port Elizabeth or Nelson Mandela Bay (Xhosa: iBhayi, alternatively Gqebera; Afrikaans: Die Baai [di \u02c8b\u0251\u02d0i]) often known by its initials PE, and colloquially as \u201cThe Friendly City\u201dor \"The Windy City\", is a major seaport city and most populous city in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.  Port Elizabeth is the seat of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa's second largest metropolitan district by area.  It is the most-populous city of the Eastern Cape and the sixth most-populous city in South Africa. the most-populous city of Eastern Cape; and the cultural, economic and financial center of the Eastern Cape.  The city is among the top five cities in the world for pleasant weather, according to a 2014 scientific climate study of 600 global cities.  Port Elizabeth is known for many blue-flag beaches along the city's urban coastline; its popularity as an international and local holiday destination; and its rich and diverse cultural heritage.  It is a tourism gateway city for the Eastern Cape and the only city with the closest proximity to malaria-free big five game reserves.The economy of Port Elizabeth is primarily oriented towards automotive assembly, manufacturing and export industries, and the city is also a major South African and sub-Saharan African destination for investment. Foreign direct investments of $19,8 billion has been secured over the past decade. Several Fortune 500 companies have a presence or their African operations headquartered in Port Elizabeth. The city's most prominent landmarks are Shark Rock pier, the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, and the Donkin Reserve.\nPort Elizabeth is a popular domestic and international holiday destination.  It is a gateway city for Eastern Cape's adventure, outdoor and African big five game, malaria-free safari tourism.Port Elizabeth is located in the south eastern coast of South Africa.  It is situated on the western portion of Algoa Bay, adjacent to the Indian Ocean.  The city lies 770 km east of Cape Town, between South Africa's Garden Route and Wild Coast.  Port Elizabeth covers 251 square kilometers of the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area, South Africa's sixth largest metropolitan municipality. Fortune 500 companies are present or have their African operations headquartered in the city.  Port Elizabeth is the second oldest city in South Africa.  It was founded in 1820 by the government of the Cape Colony when 4,000 British colonists settled Algoa Bay to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa. The city's moderate subtropical climate ranks among the top ten cities in the world for highly pleasant, all year round weather, according to a Syracuse University climatology study.Port Elizabeth is a popular tourist holiday destination. Shark Rock Pier, a prominent installation on the shoreline of Port Elizabeth's Summerstrand precinct, is the city's most famous landmark.  Port Elizabeth is a tourism gateway city for big five game viewing, South Africa's national's arts festival, outdoor recreation, adventure tourism and numerous nature conservancies, including the Baviaanskloof mega-reserve, Port Elizabeth was one of the host cities for the official tournament of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-History ===\nCave sites not far from Port Elizabeth, such as Albany, Wilton and Howiesons Poort, have given their names to various archaeological cultures. The Howiesons Poort has been of particular interest to interpretations about the origins of fully modern human behaviour. Dating to 65 000 to 62 000 years ago, it has yielded extremely old evidence for bow and arrow hunting and shell-bead jewellery. Earlier and Middle Stone Age lithic material has been found in the Sundays River Valley, while at the important site of Amanzi Springs, 40 km north of the Port Elizabeth near Addo, Earlier Stone Age artefacts are found in situ with well-preserved plant and faunal remains within spring sediments (Deacon, 1970). There is Later Stone Age archaeological material preserved in caves and rock shelters, such as Melkhoutboom Cave, in the Cape Fold Belt Mountain surrounding Port Elizabeth (see Deacon and Deacon, 1963; Deacon, 1976; Binneman, 1997) and large numbers of coastal shell middens have been reported at Humewood, St. George's Strand and the Coega River Mouth (Rudner, 1968). Most recently, Binneman and Webley (1997) reported thirteen shell middens and stone tool scatters about 500 m east of the Coega River mouth in the archaeological assessment carried out for the development of maritime infrastructure for the Port of Ngqura. Importantly, some of this archaeological material was recorded in secondary context in the gravels from older river terraces along the banks of the Coega River.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nIn 1820, the rising seaport of Algoa Bay was named  \"Port Elizabeth\" in memory of Elizabeth Frances n\u00e9e Markham, the late wife of Rufane Shaw Donkin, acting Governor of the Cape Colony.  In 2019, the Eastern Cape Geographical Names Committee (ECGNC) announced the city of Port Elizabeth is likely to have its name changed to Gqeberha, a Xhosa word used to refer to the Baakens River that flows through the city.\n\n\n=== Early History ===\nHunters and gatherers ancestral to the San first settled the area around what is now called Algoa Bay at least 10,000 years ago. Around 2,000 years ago, they were gradually displaced or assimilated by agriculturalist populations ancestral to the Xhosa people, who migrated into the region from the north.\n\n\n=== British Settlement ===\nThe first Europeans to visit the area sailed with the Portuguese explorers Bartholomeu Dias, who landed on St Croix Island in Algoa Bay in 1488, and Vasco da Gama, who noted the nearby Bird Island in 1497. For centuries, the area appeared on European navigation charts marked simply as \"a landing place with fresh water\".The Portuguese Crown had as one of its main goals in the Indian Ocean taking over the lucrative trade of Arab and Afro-Arabian merchants who plied routes between the East African coast and India. As they took over that trade in Africa, the Portuguese strengthened trading with Goa, their main trading point in India. The name Algoa means \"to Goa\", just as the port further north in present-day Mozambique, Delagoa means \"from Goa\" in Portuguese.The area became part of the Cape Colony. This area had a turbulent history between the settlement by the Dutch East India Company in 1652 and the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910.\n\nIn 1799, at the time of the first British occupation of the Colony during the Napoleonic Wars, British troops built a stone fort named Fort Frederick after the Duke of York. This fort, aiming to deter a possible landing of French troops, was constructed to oversee the site of what later became Port Elizabeth. The fort is now preserved as a monument.From 1814 to 1821 the Strandfontein farm was owned by Piet Retief. He later became a Voortrekker leader and was killed in 1837 by Zulu king Dingane during negotiations about land. An estimated 500 men, woman and children of his party were massacred. Frederik Korsten owned the Strandfontein farm after Retief. The suburb of Korsten was named after Frederick in the 19th century. This area was later developed as the Summerstrand beach suburb of Port Elizabeth.In 1820 a party of 4,000 British settlers arrived by sea, encouraged by the government of the Cape Colony to form a settlement to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa people. At this time the seaport town was founded by Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin, the Acting Governor of the Cape Colony (in office: 1820-1821). \nDiplomat Edmund Roberts visited Port Elizabeth in the early 1830s. Roberts noted that Port Elizabeth in the 1820s had \"contained four houses, and now it has upward of one hundred houses, and its residents are rated at above twelve hundred persons\".The Roman Catholic Church established the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope, Eastern District in the city in 1847. Port Elizabeth was granted the status of autonomous municipality in 1861. \nCape Colony Prime Minister John Molteno had formed the Cape Government Railways in 1872. Completion of the railway to Kimberley in 1873 was a major stimulus to trade and a rapid increase in population in the town. With the massive expansion of the Cape Colony's railway network to the interior over the following years, the harbour of Port Elizabeth became the focus for serving import and export needs of a large area of the Cape's hinterland. The rapid economic development around the port, which followed the railway construction, caused Port Elizabeth to be nicknamed \"the Liverpool of South Africa\", after a major British port. The town expanded as a diverse community, comprising Xhosa as well as European, Cape Malay, and other immigrants.\n\nDuring the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902, the port served as an important transit-point for British soldiers, horses, and materials headed by railway to the front. No armed conflict took place within the city, but it felt the effects of the war with the arrival of many refugees who moved into the city. These included Boer women and children, whom the British interned in a concentration camp. \nAfter the war, the British erected a monument to military horses that died during the war. \"The unveiling of the monument commemorating the services of the horses which perished during the Anglo Boer War, 1899-1902, took place on Saturday afternoon, February 11, 1905, with His Worship the Mayor, Mr A Fettes, performing the ceremony.\"\n\n\n=== Apartheid era ===\nUnder apartheid, the South African government established legal racial segregation and started programs to separate communities physically as well as by classification and custom. The forced relocation under the auspices of the Group Areas Act of the non-white population from mixed areas began in 1962, causing various townships to be built for their use. Classification was sometimes arbitrary, and as in many other localities throughout the country, many citizens appearing to have mixed ancestry were at times subject to re-classification, which often had intrusive sociopolitical results. The non-white tenants of South End, and land owners in Fairview were forcibly relocated from 1965 through to 1975, as these areas were valued as prime real estate. The city-planning was viewed as the prototypical apartheid city.\nAs black South Africans organized to try to achieve civil rights and social justice, government repression increased. In 1977 Steve Biko, the black anti-apartheid activist, was interrogated and tortured by the security police in Port Elizabeth before being transported to Pretoria, where he died. Other notable deaths in the city during this time included those of The Cradock Four, and of George Botha, a high-school teacher.\n\n\n==== 1952 Defiance Campaign ====\nIn 1952 the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress (SAIC) called all South Africans to stand up against the apartheid government's unjust laws directed at the black African, Indian and coloured population. On April 6, while most white South Africans celebrated the tercentenary of Jan van Riebeeck's arrival at the Cape in 1652, the ANC and SAIC called on black South Africans to observe the day as a \"A National Day of Pledge and Prayer\". 15 000 people attended in Johannesburg, 10 000 in Cape Town, 10 000 in Durban and 20 000 in Port Elizabeth. The meeting in Port Elizabeth was led by Professor Z. K. Matthews and by Raymond Mhlaba.\nOn 25 July 1952, a day before the official start of the Defiance Campaign, 30 volunteers led by Raymond Mhlaba gathered at the New Brighton Civic Centre and prayed throughout the night. At 5am on 26 July, they left the Civic Centre and walked towards the New Brighton Railway Station. In Raymond Mhlaba's Personal Memoirs: Reminiscing from Rwanda and Uganda, Mhlaba recalled:\n\n\"I led the very first group and we entered the 'Europeans Only' section of the New Brighton station. By half past six we were already in police vans on our way to jail. It turned out that my party (group) was the very first to defy unjust laws in the whole of South Africa. Little did we know that we were making history.\"\n\nMhlaba became the first man to be arrested during the campaign, while Florence Matomela was the first woman. 2 007 people were arrested in Port Elizabeth during the Defiance Campaign included Oom Gov (Govan Mbeki) and Vuyisile Mini. Other volunteers who emerged as key role players during the campaign included Nosipho Dastile, Nontuthuzelo Mabala, Lilian Diedricks and Veronica Sobukwe.\n\n\n==== 1985 Consumer Boycotts ====\nAfter the formation of the ANC-affiliated United Democratic Front in 1983, political consciousness in black townships grew. With numerous protests across the country and the massacre in Langa township near Uitenhage, Eastern Cape police presence had increased in South African townships. In Port Elizabeth townships, black South Africans demanded the integration of public institutions, the removal of troops from black townships, and the end of workplace discrimination. To launch an effective campaign to cripple the white-owned institutions of Port Elizabeth and to undermine the legitimacy of apartheid, several women suggested the idea of a consumer boycott to the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO) in May 1985. The economic boycott began on July 15, 1985, and received massive support in townships around Port Elizabeth. By September 1985, white business-owners became desperate and called on the government to meet the demands of black South Africans. In November the boycott was still hurting white businesses in Port Elizabeth greatly. The white South African government reached an agreement with PEBCO which stated that the boycott would halt until March 1986 if business owners arranged for the release of black leaders.In 1986, as the deal was approaching its end, the boycotters imposed a deadline of March 31, stating that the boycott would resume if the initial demands were not met. On March 11, the government unexpectedly banned two leaders, one of whom was Mkuseli Jack. However, on March 22, the ban was lifted by the decision of a Supreme Court Justice on the grounds that the government had given insufficient reasons. Jack ripped up the ban papers, and used the celebration as a way to represent the solidarity that the campaign required. As the demands of the boycotters were not met by March 31, the boycott was renewed on April 1. The boycott continued for nine weeks, but on June 12, 1986, another state of emergency was imposed by the National Party government. Security forces searched through the townships, arresting thousands and raiding the offices of black civics, trade unions, the UDF, the South African Council, and churches and also confiscating documents.\n\n\n=== Modern History ===\nWith the establishment of the  Coega Industrial Development Zone (CIDZ), foreign direct and also national-level investment has improved substantially in the region of Nelson Mandela Bay/Port Elizabeth. The IDZ, under the stewardship of the Coega Development Corporation (CDC), since inception has managed to attract to its investment account in excess of R140-billion into the economy of the Eastern Cape and has enabled the creation of over 45 000 jobs. This is significant for the sustainability of the IDZ, Nelson Mandela Bay, and the economy of the Eastern Cape. The CDC consistently continues to demonstrate its capability as the leading catalyst for socio-economic growth in the Eastern Cape, with a view to becoming so for South Africa.\nIn 2001 the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality was formed as an administrative area covering Port Elizabeth, the neighbouring towns of Uitenhage and Despatch and the surrounding agricultural areas. The name honours former President Nelson Mandela. The combined metropolitan area had a population estimated at around 1.3 million in 2006.\n\n\n==== 2010 FIFA World Cup ====\nOvertaking its next door neighbouring city East London, Port Elizabeth became the host city for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium hosted eight World Cup games were South Korea vs Greece, Ivory Coast vs Portugal, Germany vs Serbia; Chile vs Switzerland, Slovenia vs England in the Group Stage, then Uruguay, South Korea in the Round of 16. A quarter-final between Netherlands, Brazil was hosted, then for the Third Place playoff, Uruguay, Germany were hosted at the stadium. The World Cup was played between 11 June 2010 and 11 July 2010. Spain were the eventual champions.\n\n\n==== 2013 Africa Cup of Nations ====\nPort Elizabeth was also one of the five cities that hosted the 2013 Afcon event. Same stadium of 2010 World Cup hosted eight games: five matches of Group B included Ghana, DR Congo; Mali, Niger; Ghana, Mali; DR. Congo, Niger; Ghana, Niger; one match of Group A Cape Verde, Angola. Quarterfinal Ghana, Cape Verde, then Third Place playoff Ghana, Mali. The Africa Cup of Nations took place between 19 January and 10 February 2013. Nigeria were eventual champions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Port Elizabeth has an oceanic climate (Cfb\u202f). The area lies between the winter rainfall, Mediterranean climate zones of the Western Cape and the summer rainfall regions of eastern South Africa. Winters are cool but mild and summers are warm but considerably less humid and hot than more northerly parts of South Africa's east coast. The climate is very even throughout the year with extreme heat or moderate cold rare.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nPort Elizabeth represents a large percentage of South Africa's biological diversity and the city is a confluence point five of the seven South African biomes, namely the Thicket, Grassland, Nama-Karoo, Fynbos and Forest Biomes. A number of municipal nature reserves have been included in, and can be visited along the \u201cOutward Bound Route\u201d of the city. A mosaic of these 5 Biomes could be experienced in these reserves. The outward bound route is an eco-outdoor adventure and sports route incorporating walking and wildlife experiences. The aim of this route is to spread tourism to similar attractions along the route, leading to increased foot traffic and related benefits to these sites.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nAs a British colonial town, the city had a strongly British character, and the central area retains that to this day. Few of the buildings featured in this tour would be out of place in an English market town.  The colonial City Hall is a national monument. The Port Elizabeth main public library is an excellent example of Victorian Gothic architecture. Various memorials are situated throughout the city environs, and there are many tours available to familiarise visitors with especially the apartheid era. Port Elizabeth could be considered to be the country's leading centre of Art Nouveau style architecture due to its European heritage. Many buildings display the intricate stonework, wrought iron and stained glass of that era which are prominently visible in the Central Historical areas of the city. Combinations of Art Nouveau and Colonial styles are seen in residences along Cape Road.The area also boasts a collection of Cape Dutch style architecture as well as the Victorian and Edwardian styles, resulting from the arrival of the 1820 British settlers. Although influenced by Dutch architecture, the Cape Dutch style is unique to South Africa and examples can be seen all over the Eastern and Western Cape. \n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\nPort Elizabeth has numerous water features in its encompassing area.  There is a vast length of marine coastline on the city's outer encroachments particularly southwards. Beaches like Kings Beach, Hobie Beach, Bluewater Bay, Sardinia Bay, and the beaches along Marine Drive are abundant. Kings Beach is adjacent to Port Elizabeth's harbour, and the longshore drift from Cape Recife provides a plentiful supply of sea sand. On the north westerly coastline of Port Elizabeth, the contours tends to be rockier than the area between Cape Recife, and the Port of Ngqura. Port Elizabeth has a few rivers, of which the Baakens River is the most prominent. This river usually floods when a reasonable amount precipitation is observed, especially at low level crossings. North End Lake is the largest natural freshwater body in Port Elizabeth, but has experienced a form of contamination from industry. (It is not recommended to ingest anything from this lake) Also, numerous smaller \"lakes\" are in the surrounding area, namely Lake Farm.  Port Elizabeth (as a whole, the entire Eastern Cape) is experiencing a devastating drought, of which a disaster has been declared by the current office bearers of the greater municipality. Water restrictions are in place, and measures are in place to provide enough water in the near future, namely freshwater treatment works being constructed to acquire additional water from the Gariep Dam.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPort Elizabeth is the most populous city in the Eastern Cape. In 2001:\nArea: 335.3 square kilometres (129.5 sq mi)\nPopulation: 237,502: 708.32 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,834.5/sq mi)\nHouseholds: 70,606: 210.58 per square kilometre (545.4/sq mi)\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Trade and industry ===\nThe largest economic sectors in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro are manufacturing, finance, community services and transport. Community services, trade and manufacturing sectors are the sectors that create the most employment in the Metro. The city offers a wealth of tourism and recreation opportunity due to its biodiversity, beaches and open spaces.  Further still, Nelson Mandela Bay is a preferred region for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, flour, meat, frozen veggies, soft drinks, chocolates, cheese, yoghurt, ice-cream, paper and leather products.Historically, the majority of trade in the region came through Port Elizabeth. In the 1830s, at least five ships regularly transported goods to Europe. It became a free port in 1832. In 1833, about 50 vessels had moved through the port. In 1828, 55,201 pounds, (25038 kg), of goods were imported through the port, increasing by 1832 to 112,845 pounds, (51185 kg), imported in that year. Port Elizabeth exported 41,290 pounds, (18738 kg), in 1828, with a large increase to 86,931 pounds, (39431 kg), goods exported in 1829. Exports included wine, brandy, vinegar, ivory, hides and skins, leather, tallow, butter, soap, wool, ostrich feathers, salted beef, wheat, candles, aloe, barley, and more.Home of South Africa's motor vehicle industry, Port Elizabeth boasts most vehicle assembly plants, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Continental Tyres and many other automotive-related companies. As of 2018, after GM's exit from Port Elizabeth and South Africa, Isuzu took over their production plant in Struandale. In 2016, Chinese state-owned automotive manufacturer BAIC and South Africa's Industrial Development Corporation announced a R11 billion joint venture for the establishment of a semi knock down vehicle assembly plant in Coega.  It is anticipated that the plant will go online in 2020.  The FAW also have built a multi-billion rand plant in the region. Most other industries in Port Elizabeth are geared towards the motor vehicle industry, providing parts such as wiring harnesses, catalytic converters, batteries and tyres to the vehicle manufacturers.\nPort Elizabeth is also a major seaport, with the most significant car loading facilities in the southern hemisphere. As part of the ongoing development, a new Industrial Development Zone with expanded port facilities has been built at Coega.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nLocated at the end of the picturesque Garden Route along the Cape coast, the city has beaches in and near it. The most popular swimming beaches include King's Beach and Hobie Beach.\nMany local historic attractions are linked by the Donkin Heritage Trail. These include the Campanile (bell tower), built in 1923 to commemorate the arrival of the 1820 Settlers and offering a viewpoint over the city; the city hall (1862); the Donkin Reserve park and monument; and the old stone Fort Frederick itself (1799). The CBD also boasts the towering Eastern Cape post office headquarters.\nRoute 67 is a walking trail consisting of 67 public artworks, symbolising 67 years which Nelson Mandela dedicated to the freedom of South Africa. The artwork is a celebration of South African culture and history and is scattered along the route as it starts from the Campanile, up the stairs to the Vuysile Mini Market Square and to the large South African flag at the Donkin Reserve. The artworks were created by local Eastern Cape artists.Other attractions include the gardens at St George's Park, the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum (formerly known as the King George VI Art Gallery), the museum and oceanography room at Humewood, and the new Boardwalk waterfront complex.\nThe wider area surrounding PE also features game viewing opportunities, including the Addo Elephant National Park, 72 kilometres (45 mi) to the north near the Zuurberg mountain range.\nPort Elizabeth is also a destination for whale watching with humpback whales sighted between June and August, and again between November and January, southern right whales sighted between July and November, and Bryde's whales sighted all year round.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe biggest sporting events in Port Elizabeth, is the annual Ironman triathlon and the Herald Cycle tour. The Tuna classic deep-sea fishing competition attracts anglers from all over the world.\nThe city has facilities catering for cricket, rugby union, athletics, association football, field hockey and many other sports. Its coastal location also makes it a base for many watersports.\nPort Elizabeth is the location of the St George's Park cricket ground, which holds test cricket matches. St George's Park is the oldest cricket ground in South Africa, and was the venue for the first Test match played outside of Australia or England, between South Africa and England on 12 and 13 March 1889. The Warriors, a franchise cricket team in South Africa, is based in Port Elizabeth. The stadium is also known for its band that entertains fans at the Proteas games.\nThe headquarters of the Southern Spears rugby franchise was in Port Elizabeth. The long-standing Eastern Province Rugby Union, now commonly known as the Eastern Province Elephants, formed the basis of the Spears franchise together with East London's Border Bulldogs. The remnants of the Spears were later reconstituted into the Southern Kings, also based in Port Elizabeth, which joined Super Rugby in 2013. The Southern Kings did not participate in Super Rugby in 2014 or 2015, and returned to Super Rugby in 2016, 2017, but were dropped for economical reasons by SARU. The team now competes in the Guinness Pro14. The Eastern Province Rugby Union play their home matches at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, built for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn December 2011, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium became the new home of the South Africa Sevens, the country's leg of the annual IRB Sevens World Series in rugby sevens. The event had previously been held in three other cities, most recently in George in the Western Cape from 2002 to 2010. As of 2015, is hosted annually in Cape Town, in the Western Cape.\nThe city's main football club is Chippa United, they currently use the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium as their home ground. Previous clubs to play in the country's top tier were Bay United, Michau Warriors, Port Elizabeth Blackpool, Hotspur F.C., Port Elizabeth City and Westview Apollon.\nThe Algoa Bay Yacht Club operates out of the Port of Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n== Government ==\nPort Elizabeth had its own municipality from 1843 to 2000.  Since then, it has formed part of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, and serves as the seat for the surrounding Cacadu District Municipality. It has a Magistrate's Court, a local seat of the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court, and a branch of the Labour Court. As a result of the presence of a High Court, several other related organs of state such as a Masters Office and a Director of Public Prosecutions are present in the city.\nAll Government (mostly provincial) departments maintain branches or other offices in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe Port Elizabeth municipality assumed a coat of arms on 9 January 1878.  The design, prepared by Bradbury Wilkinson and Company (of London), was a simplified version of the arms of Sir Rufane Donkin : Gules,  on a chevron Argent between two cinquefoils in chief and a bugle horn stringed in base Or, three buckles Sable;  a chief embattled Argent thereon an elephant statant proper.  The crest was a sailing ship, and the motto In meliora spera.\n(In layman's terms : a red shield displaying, from top to bottom, an elephant on a silver horizontal strip whose lower edge is embattled, two gold cinquefoils, a silver chevron bearing three black buckles, and a gold bugle horn.)\nEighty years later, in 1958, the council made slight changes to the arms, and had them granted by the College of Arms.  The changes consisted of adding two anchors to the chief of the shield, placing a red mural crown bearing three golden rings below the ship in the crest, and changing the motto to Tu meliora spera.  The arms were registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in 1959, and at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1986.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University Level ===\nThe Nelson Mandela University was formed by the amalgamation of the University of Port Elizabeth, Port Elizabeth Technikon, and the Port Elizabeth campus of Vista University. It is the largest university in the Eastern and Southern Cape, with around 29,000 students in seven faculties spread over seven campuses.\nRussell Road College and AFDA also have campuses in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== High School Level ===\nThe city has a number of top government-funded and private schools, although the abuse of substances seems to prevail in some schools due to a lack of drug prevention training on the part of the educational system, including Alexander Road High School, Collegiate Girls' High School, Victoria Park High School, Grey High School, Pearson High School, Woodridge College, Andrew Rabie High School and Lawson Brown High School.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nPort Elizabeth lies on the N2 road. To the west the road travels the Garden Route to George and Cape Town; to the east, the road runs through the Border Country through Makhanda, to East London then on to Durban, terminating in Ermelo in Mpumalanga. The R75 connects Port Elizabeth to the Karoo. The major routes within the city are numbered as metropolitan or M routes.\nThe city's main bus station is in Market Square. The public bus service is run by the Algoa Bus Company.  Between 1881 and 1948, there was a Port Elizabeth tramway network, powered initially by horses, and later by electricity.\nThe city is in the process of building a bus rapid transit system which was intended for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This has been a massive failure as local taxi associations have prevented the implementation. Port Elizabeth lacks a proper public transport system which has had a negative impact on the poorer residents of the city who are dependent on public transport. Construction of the bus rapid transit network has been suspended due to mismanagement which led to the project missing its May 2010 deadline. Calls for the project, which has left many parts of the city in a permanent state of construction, have been made recently, and it is expected that the government will make a decision on the matter soon.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nPort Elizabeth railway station is served by South Africa's rail network. Local commuter services are operated by Metrorail, while the Shosholoza Meyl long-distance passenger service links PE with Johannesburg via Bloemfontein where it is possible to connect with other long-distance routes.The Apple Express narrow-gauge tourist train to Avontuur operated from the separate station in Humewood Road near King's Beach. It departed regularly for Thornhill Village via Van Stadens River bridge, the highest narrow-gauge rail bridge in the world. The Apple Express was launched to provide a service to transport fresh produce and wood from the farms along the line to Avontuur. The line was completed in 1914 and the train delivered produce directly from the farms to ships in the Port Elizabeth Harbour. Due to modern transport methods such as containerisation, and refrigerated containers and trucks, the Apple Express and its services became redundant. Service has now ceased.\nIn preparation for the 2010 World Cup Soccer event the Humerail Station was extensively upgraded. Several disused narrow gauge goods wagons were scrapped and removed from the site, several buildings in the area have also been renovated and revamped.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nPort Elizabeth Airport (IATA airport code PLZ, ICAO airport code FAPE) serves the city for both passenger and cargo traffic. It is the fourth busiest airport in South Africa after O.R. Tambo International Airport, King Shaka International Airport in Durban, and Cape Town International Airport.\nInternational visitors to the city must currently fly to either Johannesburg, Cape Town or Durban, and then take a domestic flight to Port Elizabeth. An upgrade to the terminal building, completed in 2004, created the necessary facilities to handle international flights although none are scheduled as yet.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nPort Elizabeth has a harbour in Algoa Bay, and the construction of an additional international harbour at Coega has supported an increase in the size of the city's industries and the addition of new industries.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city has government-funded and private hospitals, including:\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nPort Elizabeth is served by a few radio outlets, namely Algoa FM, Umhlobo Wenene FM (radio broadcasting to the residents of Port Elizabeth, as well as the entire Eastern Cape, and Garden Route, and globally, online.)\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nThe Herald serves the English populace in terms of newspaper, on a daily basis. Die Burger serves the Afrikaans communities as well with a well established readership base.\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nThere are various social media news groups in Port Elizabeth, which is used at most as neighbourhood watch groups.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe SABC has a regional office in Port Elizabeth.  Bay TV is a free-to-air station established by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality that broadcasts 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. The station focusses on African story-telling and creating platforms for local content creators, and receives funding from local government and corporate donors.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n Beira, Mozambique\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nRed Location Museum\nList of heritage sites in Port Elizabeth\nFort Frederick, Eastern Cape\nBloemendal\nNational Monument\nVictorian era\nDonkin Heritage Trail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPort Elizabeth of Yore: The Defiance Campaign of 1952",

        "wiki": "Port Elizabeth or Nelson Mandela Bay (Xhosa: iBhayi, alternatively Gqebera; Afrikaans: Die Baai [di \u02c8b\u0251\u02d0i]) often known by its initials PE, and colloquially as \u201cThe Friendly City\u201dor \"The Windy City\", is a major seaport city and most populous city in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.  Port Elizabeth is the seat of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa's second largest metropolitan district by area.  It is the most-populous city of the Eastern Cape and the sixth most-populous city in South Africa. the most-populous city of Eastern Cape; and the cultural, economic and financial center of the Eastern Cape.  The city is among the top five cities in the world for pleasant weather, according to a 2014 scientific climate study of 600 global cities.  Port Elizabeth is known for many blue-flag beaches along the city's urban coastline; its popularity as an international and local holiday destination; and its rich and diverse cultural heritage.  It is a tourism gateway city for the Eastern Cape and the only city with the closest proximity to malaria-free big five game reserves.The economy of Port Elizabeth is primarily oriented towards automotive assembly, manufacturing and export industries, and the city is also a major South African and sub-Saharan African destination for investment. Foreign direct investments of $19,8 billion has been secured over the past decade. Several Fortune 500 companies have a presence or their African operations headquartered in Port Elizabeth. The city's most prominent landmarks are Shark Rock pier, the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, and the Donkin Reserve.\nPort Elizabeth is a popular domestic and international holiday destination.  It is a gateway city for Eastern Cape's adventure, outdoor and African big five game, malaria-free safari tourism.Port Elizabeth is located in the south eastern coast of South Africa.  It is situated on the western portion of Algoa Bay, adjacent to the Indian Ocean.  The city lies 770 km east of Cape Town, between South Africa's Garden Route and Wild Coast.  Port Elizabeth covers 251 square kilometers of the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area, South Africa's sixth largest metropolitan municipality. Fortune 500 companies are present or have their African operations headquartered in the city.  Port Elizabeth is the second oldest city in South Africa.  It was founded in 1820 by the government of the Cape Colony when 4,000 British colonists settled Algoa Bay to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa. The city's moderate subtropical climate ranks among the top ten cities in the world for highly pleasant, all year round weather, according to a Syracuse University climatology study.Port Elizabeth is a popular tourist holiday destination. Shark Rock Pier, a prominent installation on the shoreline of Port Elizabeth's Summerstrand precinct, is the city's most famous landmark.  Port Elizabeth is a tourism gateway city for big five game viewing, South Africa's national's arts festival, outdoor recreation, adventure tourism and numerous nature conservancies, including the Baviaanskloof mega-reserve, Port Elizabeth was one of the host cities for the official tournament of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-History ===\nCave sites not far from Port Elizabeth, such as Albany, Wilton and Howiesons Poort, have given their names to various archaeological cultures. The Howiesons Poort has been of particular interest to interpretations about the origins of fully modern human behaviour. Dating to 65 000 to 62 000 years ago, it has yielded extremely old evidence for bow and arrow hunting and shell-bead jewellery. Earlier and Middle Stone Age lithic material has been found in the Sundays River Valley, while at the important site of Amanzi Springs, 40 km north of the Port Elizabeth near Addo, Earlier Stone Age artefacts are found in situ with well-preserved plant and faunal remains within spring sediments (Deacon, 1970). There is Later Stone Age archaeological material preserved in caves and rock shelters, such as Melkhoutboom Cave, in the Cape Fold Belt Mountain surrounding Port Elizabeth (see Deacon and Deacon, 1963; Deacon, 1976; Binneman, 1997) and large numbers of coastal shell middens have been reported at Humewood, St. George's Strand and the Coega River Mouth (Rudner, 1968). Most recently, Binneman and Webley (1997) reported thirteen shell middens and stone tool scatters about 500 m east of the Coega River mouth in the archaeological assessment carried out for the development of maritime infrastructure for the Port of Ngqura. Importantly, some of this archaeological material was recorded in secondary context in the gravels from older river terraces along the banks of the Coega River.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nIn 1820, the rising seaport of Algoa Bay was named  \"Port Elizabeth\" in memory of Elizabeth Frances n\u00e9e Markham, the late wife of Rufane Shaw Donkin, acting Governor of the Cape Colony.  In 2019, the Eastern Cape Geographical Names Committee (ECGNC) announced the city of Port Elizabeth is likely to have its name changed to Gqeberha, a Xhosa word used to refer to the Baakens River that flows through the city.\n\n\n=== Early History ===\nHunters and gatherers ancestral to the San first settled the area around what is now called Algoa Bay at least 10,000 years ago. Around 2,000 years ago, they were gradually displaced or assimilated by agriculturalist populations ancestral to the Xhosa people, who migrated into the region from the north.\n\n\n=== British Settlement ===\nThe first Europeans to visit the area sailed with the Portuguese explorers Bartholomeu Dias, who landed on St Croix Island in Algoa Bay in 1488, and Vasco da Gama, who noted the nearby Bird Island in 1497. For centuries, the area appeared on European navigation charts marked simply as \"a landing place with fresh water\".The Portuguese Crown had as one of its main goals in the Indian Ocean taking over the lucrative trade of Arab and Afro-Arabian merchants who plied routes between the East African coast and India. As they took over that trade in Africa, the Portuguese strengthened trading with Goa, their main trading point in India. The name Algoa means \"to Goa\", just as the port further north in present-day Mozambique, Delagoa means \"from Goa\" in Portuguese.The area became part of the Cape Colony. This area had a turbulent history between the settlement by the Dutch East India Company in 1652 and the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910.\n\nIn 1799, at the time of the first British occupation of the Colony during the Napoleonic Wars, British troops built a stone fort named Fort Frederick after the Duke of York. This fort, aiming to deter a possible landing of French troops, was constructed to oversee the site of what later became Port Elizabeth. The fort is now preserved as a monument.From 1814 to 1821 the Strandfontein farm was owned by Piet Retief. He later became a Voortrekker leader and was killed in 1837 by Zulu king Dingane during negotiations about land. An estimated 500 men, woman and children of his party were massacred. Frederik Korsten owned the Strandfontein farm after Retief. The suburb of Korsten was named after Frederick in the 19th century. This area was later developed as the Summerstrand beach suburb of Port Elizabeth.In 1820 a party of 4,000 British settlers arrived by sea, encouraged by the government of the Cape Colony to form a settlement to strengthen the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa people. At this time the seaport town was founded by Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin, the Acting Governor of the Cape Colony (in office: 1820-1821). \nDiplomat Edmund Roberts visited Port Elizabeth in the early 1830s. Roberts noted that Port Elizabeth in the 1820s had \"contained four houses, and now it has upward of one hundred houses, and its residents are rated at above twelve hundred persons\".The Roman Catholic Church established the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope, Eastern District in the city in 1847. Port Elizabeth was granted the status of autonomous municipality in 1861. \nCape Colony Prime Minister John Molteno had formed the Cape Government Railways in 1872. Completion of the railway to Kimberley in 1873 was a major stimulus to trade and a rapid increase in population in the town. With the massive expansion of the Cape Colony's railway network to the interior over the following years, the harbour of Port Elizabeth became the focus for serving import and export needs of a large area of the Cape's hinterland. The rapid economic development around the port, which followed the railway construction, caused Port Elizabeth to be nicknamed \"the Liverpool of South Africa\", after a major British port. The town expanded as a diverse community, comprising Xhosa as well as European, Cape Malay, and other immigrants.\n\nDuring the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902, the port served as an important transit-point for British soldiers, horses, and materials headed by railway to the front. No armed conflict took place within the city, but it felt the effects of the war with the arrival of many refugees who moved into the city. These included Boer women and children, whom the British interned in a concentration camp. \nAfter the war, the British erected a monument to military horses that died during the war. \"The unveiling of the monument commemorating the services of the horses which perished during the Anglo Boer War, 1899-1902, took place on Saturday afternoon, February 11, 1905, with His Worship the Mayor, Mr A Fettes, performing the ceremony.\"\n\n\n=== Apartheid era ===\nUnder apartheid, the South African government established legal racial segregation and started programs to separate communities physically as well as by classification and custom. The forced relocation under the auspices of the Group Areas Act of the non-white population from mixed areas began in 1962, causing various townships to be built for their use. Classification was sometimes arbitrary, and as in many other localities throughout the country, many citizens appearing to have mixed ancestry were at times subject to re-classification, which often had intrusive sociopolitical results. The non-white tenants of South End, and land owners in Fairview were forcibly relocated from 1965 through to 1975, as these areas were valued as prime real estate. The city-planning was viewed as the prototypical apartheid city.\nAs black South Africans organized to try to achieve civil rights and social justice, government repression increased. In 1977 Steve Biko, the black anti-apartheid activist, was interrogated and tortured by the security police in Port Elizabeth before being transported to Pretoria, where he died. Other notable deaths in the city during this time included those of The Cradock Four, and of George Botha, a high-school teacher.\n\n\n==== 1952 Defiance Campaign ====\nIn 1952 the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress (SAIC) called all South Africans to stand up against the apartheid government's unjust laws directed at the black African, Indian and coloured population. On April 6, while most white South Africans celebrated the tercentenary of Jan van Riebeeck's arrival at the Cape in 1652, the ANC and SAIC called on black South Africans to observe the day as a \"A National Day of Pledge and Prayer\". 15 000 people attended in Johannesburg, 10 000 in Cape Town, 10 000 in Durban and 20 000 in Port Elizabeth. The meeting in Port Elizabeth was led by Professor Z. K. Matthews and by Raymond Mhlaba.\nOn 25 July 1952, a day before the official start of the Defiance Campaign, 30 volunteers led by Raymond Mhlaba gathered at the New Brighton Civic Centre and prayed throughout the night. At 5am on 26 July, they left the Civic Centre and walked towards the New Brighton Railway Station. In Raymond Mhlaba's Personal Memoirs: Reminiscing from Rwanda and Uganda, Mhlaba recalled:\n\n\"I led the very first group and we entered the 'Europeans Only' section of the New Brighton station. By half past six we were already in police vans on our way to jail. It turned out that my party (group) was the very first to defy unjust laws in the whole of South Africa. Little did we know that we were making history.\"\n\nMhlaba became the first man to be arrested during the campaign, while Florence Matomela was the first woman. 2 007 people were arrested in Port Elizabeth during the Defiance Campaign included Oom Gov (Govan Mbeki) and Vuyisile Mini. Other volunteers who emerged as key role players during the campaign included Nosipho Dastile, Nontuthuzelo Mabala, Lilian Diedricks and Veronica Sobukwe.\n\n\n==== 1985 Consumer Boycotts ====\nAfter the formation of the ANC-affiliated United Democratic Front in 1983, political consciousness in black townships grew. With numerous protests across the country and the massacre in Langa township near Uitenhage, Eastern Cape police presence had increased in South African townships. In Port Elizabeth townships, black South Africans demanded the integration of public institutions, the removal of troops from black townships, and the end of workplace discrimination. To launch an effective campaign to cripple the white-owned institutions of Port Elizabeth and to undermine the legitimacy of apartheid, several women suggested the idea of a consumer boycott to the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO) in May 1985. The economic boycott began on July 15, 1985, and received massive support in townships around Port Elizabeth. By September 1985, white business-owners became desperate and called on the government to meet the demands of black South Africans. In November the boycott was still hurting white businesses in Port Elizabeth greatly. The white South African government reached an agreement with PEBCO which stated that the boycott would halt until March 1986 if business owners arranged for the release of black leaders.In 1986, as the deal was approaching its end, the boycotters imposed a deadline of March 31, stating that the boycott would resume if the initial demands were not met. On March 11, the government unexpectedly banned two leaders, one of whom was Mkuseli Jack. However, on March 22, the ban was lifted by the decision of a Supreme Court Justice on the grounds that the government had given insufficient reasons. Jack ripped up the ban papers, and used the celebration as a way to represent the solidarity that the campaign required. As the demands of the boycotters were not met by March 31, the boycott was renewed on April 1. The boycott continued for nine weeks, but on June 12, 1986, another state of emergency was imposed by the National Party government. Security forces searched through the townships, arresting thousands and raiding the offices of black civics, trade unions, the UDF, the South African Council, and churches and also confiscating documents.\n\n\n=== Modern History ===\nWith the establishment of the  Coega Industrial Development Zone (CIDZ), foreign direct and also national-level investment has improved substantially in the region of Nelson Mandela Bay/Port Elizabeth. The IDZ, under the stewardship of the Coega Development Corporation (CDC), since inception has managed to attract to its investment account in excess of R140-billion into the economy of the Eastern Cape and has enabled the creation of over 45 000 jobs. This is significant for the sustainability of the IDZ, Nelson Mandela Bay, and the economy of the Eastern Cape. The CDC consistently continues to demonstrate its capability as the leading catalyst for socio-economic growth in the Eastern Cape, with a view to becoming so for South Africa.\nIn 2001 the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality was formed as an administrative area covering Port Elizabeth, the neighbouring towns of Uitenhage and Despatch and the surrounding agricultural areas. The name honours former President Nelson Mandela. The combined metropolitan area had a population estimated at around 1.3 million in 2006.\n\n\n==== 2010 FIFA World Cup ====\nOvertaking its next door neighbouring city East London, Port Elizabeth became the host city for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium hosted eight World Cup games were South Korea vs Greece, Ivory Coast vs Portugal, Germany vs Serbia; Chile vs Switzerland, Slovenia vs England in the Group Stage, then Uruguay, South Korea in the Round of 16. A quarter-final between Netherlands, Brazil was hosted, then for the Third Place playoff, Uruguay, Germany were hosted at the stadium. The World Cup was played between 11 June 2010 and 11 July 2010. Spain were the eventual champions.\n\n\n==== 2013 Africa Cup of Nations ====\nPort Elizabeth was also one of the five cities that hosted the 2013 Afcon event. Same stadium of 2010 World Cup hosted eight games: five matches of Group B included Ghana, DR Congo; Mali, Niger; Ghana, Mali; DR. Congo, Niger; Ghana, Niger; one match of Group A Cape Verde, Angola. Quarterfinal Ghana, Cape Verde, then Third Place playoff Ghana, Mali. The Africa Cup of Nations took place between 19 January and 10 February 2013. Nigeria were eventual champions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Port Elizabeth has an oceanic climate (Cfb\u202f). The area lies between the winter rainfall, Mediterranean climate zones of the Western Cape and the summer rainfall regions of eastern South Africa. Winters are cool but mild and summers are warm but considerably less humid and hot than more northerly parts of South Africa's east coast. The climate is very even throughout the year with extreme heat or moderate cold rare.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nPort Elizabeth represents a large percentage of South Africa's biological diversity and the city is a confluence point five of the seven South African biomes, namely the Thicket, Grassland, Nama-Karoo, Fynbos and Forest Biomes. A number of municipal nature reserves have been included in, and can be visited along the \u201cOutward Bound Route\u201d of the city. A mosaic of these 5 Biomes could be experienced in these reserves. The outward bound route is an eco-outdoor adventure and sports route incorporating walking and wildlife experiences. The aim of this route is to spread tourism to similar attractions along the route, leading to increased foot traffic and related benefits to these sites.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nAs a British colonial town, the city had a strongly British character, and the central area retains that to this day. Few of the buildings featured in this tour would be out of place in an English market town.  The colonial City Hall is a national monument. The Port Elizabeth main public library is an excellent example of Victorian Gothic architecture. Various memorials are situated throughout the city environs, and there are many tours available to familiarise visitors with especially the apartheid era. Port Elizabeth could be considered to be the country's leading centre of Art Nouveau style architecture due to its European heritage. Many buildings display the intricate stonework, wrought iron and stained glass of that era which are prominently visible in the Central Historical areas of the city. Combinations of Art Nouveau and Colonial styles are seen in residences along Cape Road.The area also boasts a collection of Cape Dutch style architecture as well as the Victorian and Edwardian styles, resulting from the arrival of the 1820 British settlers. Although influenced by Dutch architecture, the Cape Dutch style is unique to South Africa and examples can be seen all over the Eastern and Western Cape. \n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\nPort Elizabeth has numerous water features in its encompassing area.  There is a vast length of marine coastline on the city's outer encroachments particularly southwards. Beaches like Kings Beach, Hobie Beach, Bluewater Bay, Sardinia Bay, and the beaches along Marine Drive are abundant. Kings Beach is adjacent to Port Elizabeth's harbour, and the longshore drift from Cape Recife provides a plentiful supply of sea sand. On the north westerly coastline of Port Elizabeth, the contours tends to be rockier than the area between Cape Recife, and the Port of Ngqura. Port Elizabeth has a few rivers, of which the Baakens River is the most prominent. This river usually floods when a reasonable amount precipitation is observed, especially at low level crossings. North End Lake is the largest natural freshwater body in Port Elizabeth, but has experienced a form of contamination from industry. (It is not recommended to ingest anything from this lake) Also, numerous smaller \"lakes\" are in the surrounding area, namely Lake Farm.  Port Elizabeth (as a whole, the entire Eastern Cape) is experiencing a devastating drought, of which a disaster has been declared by the current office bearers of the greater municipality. Water restrictions are in place, and measures are in place to provide enough water in the near future, namely freshwater treatment works being constructed to acquire additional water from the Gariep Dam.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nPort Elizabeth is the most populous city in the Eastern Cape. In 2001:\nArea: 335.3 square kilometres (129.5 sq mi)\nPopulation: 237,502: 708.32 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,834.5/sq mi)\nHouseholds: 70,606: 210.58 per square kilometre (545.4/sq mi)\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Trade and industry ===\nThe largest economic sectors in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro are manufacturing, finance, community services and transport. Community services, trade and manufacturing sectors are the sectors that create the most employment in the Metro. The city offers a wealth of tourism and recreation opportunity due to its biodiversity, beaches and open spaces.  Further still, Nelson Mandela Bay is a preferred region for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, flour, meat, frozen veggies, soft drinks, chocolates, cheese, yoghurt, ice-cream, paper and leather products.Historically, the majority of trade in the region came through Port Elizabeth. In the 1830s, at least five ships regularly transported goods to Europe. It became a free port in 1832. In 1833, about 50 vessels had moved through the port. In 1828, 55,201 pounds, (25038 kg), of goods were imported through the port, increasing by 1832 to 112,845 pounds, (51185 kg), imported in that year. Port Elizabeth exported 41,290 pounds, (18738 kg), in 1828, with a large increase to 86,931 pounds, (39431 kg), goods exported in 1829. Exports included wine, brandy, vinegar, ivory, hides and skins, leather, tallow, butter, soap, wool, ostrich feathers, salted beef, wheat, candles, aloe, barley, and more.Home of South Africa's motor vehicle industry, Port Elizabeth boasts most vehicle assembly plants, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Continental Tyres and many other automotive-related companies. As of 2018, after GM's exit from Port Elizabeth and South Africa, Isuzu took over their production plant in Struandale. In 2016, Chinese state-owned automotive manufacturer BAIC and South Africa's Industrial Development Corporation announced a R11 billion joint venture for the establishment of a semi knock down vehicle assembly plant in Coega.  It is anticipated that the plant will go online in 2020.  The FAW also have built a multi-billion rand plant in the region. Most other industries in Port Elizabeth are geared towards the motor vehicle industry, providing parts such as wiring harnesses, catalytic converters, batteries and tyres to the vehicle manufacturers.\nPort Elizabeth is also a major seaport, with the most significant car loading facilities in the southern hemisphere. As part of the ongoing development, a new Industrial Development Zone with expanded port facilities has been built at Coega.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nLocated at the end of the picturesque Garden Route along the Cape coast, the city has beaches in and near it. The most popular swimming beaches include King's Beach and Hobie Beach.\nMany local historic attractions are linked by the Donkin Heritage Trail. These include the Campanile (bell tower), built in 1923 to commemorate the arrival of the 1820 Settlers and offering a viewpoint over the city; the city hall (1862); the Donkin Reserve park and monument; and the old stone Fort Frederick itself (1799). The CBD also boasts the towering Eastern Cape post office headquarters.\nRoute 67 is a walking trail consisting of 67 public artworks, symbolising 67 years which Nelson Mandela dedicated to the freedom of South Africa. The artwork is a celebration of South African culture and history and is scattered along the route as it starts from the Campanile, up the stairs to the Vuysile Mini Market Square and to the large South African flag at the Donkin Reserve. The artworks were created by local Eastern Cape artists.Other attractions include the gardens at St George's Park, the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum (formerly known as the King George VI Art Gallery), the museum and oceanography room at Humewood, and the new Boardwalk waterfront complex.\nThe wider area surrounding PE also features game viewing opportunities, including the Addo Elephant National Park, 72 kilometres (45 mi) to the north near the Zuurberg mountain range.\nPort Elizabeth is also a destination for whale watching with humpback whales sighted between June and August, and again between November and January, southern right whales sighted between July and November, and Bryde's whales sighted all year round.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe biggest sporting events in Port Elizabeth, is the annual Ironman triathlon and the Herald Cycle tour. The Tuna classic deep-sea fishing competition attracts anglers from all over the world.\nThe city has facilities catering for cricket, rugby union, athletics, association football, field hockey and many other sports. Its coastal location also makes it a base for many watersports.\nPort Elizabeth is the location of the St George's Park cricket ground, which holds test cricket matches. St George's Park is the oldest cricket ground in South Africa, and was the venue for the first Test match played outside of Australia or England, between South Africa and England on 12 and 13 March 1889. The Warriors, a franchise cricket team in South Africa, is based in Port Elizabeth. The stadium is also known for its band that entertains fans at the Proteas games.\nThe headquarters of the Southern Spears rugby franchise was in Port Elizabeth. The long-standing Eastern Province Rugby Union, now commonly known as the Eastern Province Elephants, formed the basis of the Spears franchise together with East London's Border Bulldogs. The remnants of the Spears were later reconstituted into the Southern Kings, also based in Port Elizabeth, which joined Super Rugby in 2013. The Southern Kings did not participate in Super Rugby in 2014 or 2015, and returned to Super Rugby in 2016, 2017, but were dropped for economical reasons by SARU. The team now competes in the Guinness Pro14. The Eastern Province Rugby Union play their home matches at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, built for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn December 2011, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium became the new home of the South Africa Sevens, the country's leg of the annual IRB Sevens World Series in rugby sevens. The event had previously been held in three other cities, most recently in George in the Western Cape from 2002 to 2010. As of 2015, is hosted annually in Cape Town, in the Western Cape.\nThe city's main football club is Chippa United, they currently use the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium as their home ground. Previous clubs to play in the country's top tier were Bay United, Michau Warriors, Port Elizabeth Blackpool, Hotspur F.C., Port Elizabeth City and Westview Apollon.\nThe Algoa Bay Yacht Club operates out of the Port of Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n== Government ==\nPort Elizabeth had its own municipality from 1843 to 2000.  Since then, it has formed part of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, and serves as the seat for the surrounding Cacadu District Municipality. It has a Magistrate's Court, a local seat of the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court, and a branch of the Labour Court. As a result of the presence of a High Court, several other related organs of state such as a Masters Office and a Director of Public Prosecutions are present in the city.\nAll Government (mostly provincial) departments maintain branches or other offices in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe Port Elizabeth municipality assumed a coat of arms on 9 January 1878.  The design, prepared by Bradbury Wilkinson and Company (of London), was a simplified version of the arms of Sir Rufane Donkin : Gules,  on a chevron Argent between two cinquefoils in chief and a bugle horn stringed in base Or, three buckles Sable;  a chief embattled Argent thereon an elephant statant proper.  The crest was a sailing ship, and the motto In meliora spera.\n(In layman's terms : a red shield displaying, from top to bottom, an elephant on a silver horizontal strip whose lower edge is embattled, two gold cinquefoils, a silver chevron bearing three black buckles, and a gold bugle horn.)\nEighty years later, in 1958, the council made slight changes to the arms, and had them granted by the College of Arms.  The changes consisted of adding two anchors to the chief of the shield, placing a red mural crown bearing three golden rings below the ship in the crest, and changing the motto to Tu meliora spera.  The arms were registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in 1959, and at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1986.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University Level ===\nThe Nelson Mandela University was formed by the amalgamation of the University of Port Elizabeth, Port Elizabeth Technikon, and the Port Elizabeth campus of Vista University. It is the largest university in the Eastern and Southern Cape, with around 29,000 students in seven faculties spread over seven campuses.\nRussell Road College and AFDA also have campuses in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n=== High School Level ===\nThe city has a number of top government-funded and private schools, although the abuse of substances seems to prevail in some schools due to a lack of drug prevention training on the part of the educational system, including Alexander Road High School, Collegiate Girls' High School, Victoria Park High School, Grey High School, Pearson High School, Woodridge College, Andrew Rabie High School and Lawson Brown High School.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nPort Elizabeth lies on the N2 road. To the west the road travels the Garden Route to George and Cape Town; to the east, the road runs through the Border Country through Makhanda, to East London then on to Durban, terminating in Ermelo in Mpumalanga. The R75 connects Port Elizabeth to the Karoo. The major routes within the city are numbered as metropolitan or M routes.\nThe city's main bus station is in Market Square. The public bus service is run by the Algoa Bus Company.  Between 1881 and 1948, there was a Port Elizabeth tramway network, powered initially by horses, and later by electricity.\nThe city is in the process of building a bus rapid transit system which was intended for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This has been a massive failure as local taxi associations have prevented the implementation. Port Elizabeth lacks a proper public transport system which has had a negative impact on the poorer residents of the city who are dependent on public transport. Construction of the bus rapid transit network has been suspended due to mismanagement which led to the project missing its May 2010 deadline. Calls for the project, which has left many parts of the city in a permanent state of construction, have been made recently, and it is expected that the government will make a decision on the matter soon.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nPort Elizabeth railway station is served by South Africa's rail network. Local commuter services are operated by Metrorail, while the Shosholoza Meyl long-distance passenger service links PE with Johannesburg via Bloemfontein where it is possible to connect with other long-distance routes.The Apple Express narrow-gauge tourist train to Avontuur operated from the separate station in Humewood Road near King's Beach. It departed regularly for Thornhill Village via Van Stadens River bridge, the highest narrow-gauge rail bridge in the world. The Apple Express was launched to provide a service to transport fresh produce and wood from the farms along the line to Avontuur. The line was completed in 1914 and the train delivered produce directly from the farms to ships in the Port Elizabeth Harbour. Due to modern transport methods such as containerisation, and refrigerated containers and trucks, the Apple Express and its services became redundant. Service has now ceased.\nIn preparation for the 2010 World Cup Soccer event the Humerail Station was extensively upgraded. Several disused narrow gauge goods wagons were scrapped and removed from the site, several buildings in the area have also been renovated and revamped.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nPort Elizabeth Airport (IATA airport code PLZ, ICAO airport code FAPE) serves the city for both passenger and cargo traffic. It is the fourth busiest airport in South Africa after O.R. Tambo International Airport, King Shaka International Airport in Durban, and Cape Town International Airport.\nInternational visitors to the city must currently fly to either Johannesburg, Cape Town or Durban, and then take a domestic flight to Port Elizabeth. An upgrade to the terminal building, completed in 2004, created the necessary facilities to handle international flights although none are scheduled as yet.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nPort Elizabeth has a harbour in Algoa Bay, and the construction of an additional international harbour at Coega has supported an increase in the size of the city's industries and the addition of new industries.\n\n\n== Health care ==\nThe city has government-funded and private hospitals, including:\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nPort Elizabeth is served by a few radio outlets, namely Algoa FM, Umhlobo Wenene FM (radio broadcasting to the residents of Port Elizabeth, as well as the entire Eastern Cape, and Garden Route, and globally, online.)\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nThe Herald serves the English populace in terms of newspaper, on a daily basis. Die Burger serves the Afrikaans communities as well with a well established readership base.\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nThere are various social media news groups in Port Elizabeth, which is used at most as neighbourhood watch groups.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe SABC has a regional office in Port Elizabeth.  Bay TV is a free-to-air station established by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality that broadcasts 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. The station focusses on African story-telling and creating platforms for local content creators, and receives funding from local government and corporate donors.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n Beira, Mozambique\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nRed Location Museum\nList of heritage sites in Port Elizabeth\nFort Frederick, Eastern Cape\nBloemendal\nNational Monument\nVictorian era\nDonkin Heritage Trail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPort Elizabeth of Yore: The Defiance Campaign of 1952",

          "On my recent visit to South Africa, Port Elizabeth stood out to me as a town where art, and street art particularly, was being promoted and invested in. How wonderful, and The Donkin is a high point here. Great outdoor installations and sculpture, and what a setting with fab",
          "Beautiful view of the city!! Amazing artwork, along with great history information along the Route 67, Just missing the giant flag.",
          "I had booked the tour with afroventures and I must say the tour guide was outstanding. He was professional; knowledgeable and accommodation. Very informed.",
          "WATCH OUT we were told to get parking tickets and leaded into scam at an ATM, lost our bank passes... The people doing it looked like officals, wore badges. When approached I advise you to get out of the place asap!",
          "If you can hire a guide, do it because there are not many signa explaining many things you see. Go up the stairs in the lighthouse. It is worth the view!!!",
          "The Donkin reserve overlooks that city of Port Elizabeth. There is some beautiful art work in the area as well as a pyramid dedicated to Elizabeth Donkin, the woman that the city is named after.",
          "Agree with all excellent reviews of lighthouse. This review is a warning: Yesterday we visited the lighthouse and had a pleasant visit. We left for a short while and then returned to eat our lunch on the grass. I was approached by an officious looking man with a name badge that",
          "We did not know what to expect when visiting the Donkin Reserve. You can even stop by when it is closed. The lighthouse is beautiful and the mosaic outside colorful and a great photo op. There is a Mandela Art Piece which is simply WONDERFUL. Stop by regardless of opening",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Donkin Reserve. 84 steps up the old lighthouse is a must, for fantastic views of Port Elizabeth. The entire premises is packed with interesting things to see, from the pyramid built in honour of Elizabeth, after whom the city was named, late wife of",
          "We walked to the Donkin Reserve after eating lunch at the Stage Door. I wasn't sure of the area as it looked kind of dicey, but it was okay. The people manning the visitors centre were friendly and knew their area attractions. It was very windy at the Donkin Reserve as it's",
          "This park has great views of Port Elizabeth downtown and harbor. The pyramid dedicated to Elizabeth Donkin is there , great Mosaic (which needs a bit of repair) and the big SA flag which doesn\u2019t fly everyday.",
          "We visited this place included in a city day tour. Starting with the Visitor Information Centre and the lighthouse, we learn about the Donkin history and enjoy the interesting surroundings (colourful mosaics, the pyramid in honour of Mr. Donkin's wife Elizabeth, whose name was",
          "Great for those who want to find out a little more about the history of Port Elizabeth (very little though) Great views of the city and a few artistic pieces to be seen. There is also a place to get tourist attractions information etc.",
          "The art that forms part of the route 67 is wonderful, and I enjoyed climbing up the lighthouse to see views over the city. Note that the stairs in the lighthouse are very steep (almost ladders) though so not suitable for those with mobility issues or fear of heights.",
          "We were looking for the information office at the Donkin and were pleasantly surprised with the other artworks around the place. The pyramid structure has a great little romantic story of how it was built and why. A good place to visit for a lunch break or find out more on",
          "If you are claustrophobic and scared of heights not the one for you. But awesome experience. Stunning and safe surrounds even if you don\u2019t make it to the top.",
          "The site is located on a hill and offers good views of Port Elizabeth. The site is a memorial to the love of his life - his wife. The site consists of a lighthouse, a pyramid and a mosaic. Security could be an issue, best come in a group.",
          "For me this lighthouse hold personal memories, so despite some warnings about not being safe, We did visit and found only a few other tourists on the windy afternoon near the lighthouse. It is a beautiful open space and there is lovely photo opportunities that can take up some",
          "Got robbed at noon by two men with a gun. Terrible experince being pushed on the ground being pregnant getting a gun pointed at you. Stole my phone, tried to streal purse and camera. Ruined whole holiday. Didn\u2019t see any guards or police. DON\u2019T COME HERE!",
          "As mentioned in some of the other reviews security is a problem here, which is a pity as it is an interesting place to visit. Apart from giving one some idea as to the naming of Port Elizabeth there are also visual sights to enjoy. Apart from the lighthouse and pyramid there is",
          "Not really too much to it, but a nice view of the city and some interesting art and tributes to people of the past.",

          "My husband and I took a walk to the Donkin Reserve to see the pyramid and lighthouse. The mosaic on the floor is worth taking the time to look properly at and not just glance. I think it was 10rand to go up the lighthouse which I would recommend. It\u2019s not the easiest to climb",
          "At least something to do in PE. You can also follow some kind of art path. It is possible to go up the lighthouse for 10 Rand were you have a very nice over the ocean and PE. The mosaik is to be seen very nicely from up there as well.",
          "My visit was not very recent but would say the maintenance of the gardens and indigenous plants is poor, security could be risky, so dont carry passports cameras money etc openly, and move around in groups larger than two if possible, or when the area is busy. It is",
          "With an amazing view, artwork and the second largest flag in Africa spanning two tennis courts, this is certainly a place to stop and make a visit",

          "Lived in PE for many years during its golden years. Nowadays the historic centre of Port Elizabeth is like so many other cities in Africa, somewhat messy and dangerous. Great to visit, but do it in the middle of the afternoon when people are around. Night time--don't go there.",
          "Certainly worth a visit but quite frankly the area has seen better days as it is really just above central Port Elizabeth. It does however afford nice views. Parking is easy and whilst walking on the grassy area of the Reserve should be fine I would caution against venturing",
          "Very neat and clean, with families, tourists and young people hanging out. The tourist centre is right next to the lighthouse.",
          "There is a good view above the city and a lot of monuments and memories about south african history in the square, however it is not well maintained. Also some of the old-beautiful buildings around seem to be abandoned.",
          "We arrive at 13:30 hoping to climb the lighthouse. Everything was locked up tight. Could still enjoy the views and art installations.",
          "The Donkin reserve overlook the city and contains a monument in the shape of a pyramid dedicated to Elizabeth Donkin, the woman who gave her name to the city beneath.",
          "We got robbed at the corner to the Edward Hotel during day (1 pm) with lots of people around. Three men with a gun. Its not safe at PE. Even at touristic places. So watch out.",

          "The Donkin Reserve is a history rich, cultural attraction in the heart of PE. The views are stunning and the metro seem to have made some effort in making this a genuine tourist attraction. Safety in this area is still a concern, however I did see some guards walking around",
          "We had a short stop here as part of our day tour but it was long enough to take in the art sculptures, the pyramid and lighthouse, the tall flag pole with the biggest flag in South Africa and the lovely mosaic. A very peaceful environment and if you are feeling energetic, pay to",
          "Whether you follow the 67 steps to democracy, or find another way to the top of the hill, you can go into the tourist centre and pay admission to climb the historic Donkin Lighthouse. Inside the narrow lighthouse, it\u2019s a steep and narrow climb, but when you reach the final",
          "I frequently visit the Donkin Reserve because there are so many different features worth photographing - from the historical buildings, public artworks on Route 67, scenes of the harbour and so much more. It's best to visit in a group if you are tourists and before dark, because",
          "Worth a vist to see the big flag and if game for the high climb up into the light house the veiw is a great reward. Just not recommended for persons with a fear of hights, however there is space to have a seat and wait for the rest of the adventurers climbing up.",
          "We had some time to kill awaiting flight and was advised to come here. Parking free nearby too. You can get map of a 2hr walk around donkin from the lighthouse tourist info centre for 40rand. We didnt have time to do so walked around the lighthouse and art work nearby.",
          "The Donkin reserve with its Donkin memorial and the other new additions of artwork both on the reserve and on the steps down to the city centre are a testimonial to a city striving to encourage tourism.",
          "This place has a nice mixture of old and new to see. Old buildings like the Edward Hotel, the Grey Institute, the old Donkin houses, the Pyramid for Elizabeth and the lighthouse. As well as the new features like the big flag mast, Mandela and his voters, mosaic paving showing",
          "I loved the Donkin Reserve! There are so many beautiful and culturally rich things to see and experience here. The art and attention to detail is really special. Even though it is in the centre of the city, there is a sense of peace and tranquility here. Exquisite views (which I",
          "This historic site is situated in the heart of the city- but unfortunately in a very high crime area/ red light district of PE. Not safe to visit after sunset.",
          "Indeed the Donkin Reserve is one of the best treasures of PE. I had such a great time on a Saturday afternoon with my little sister, just hanging out in the beautiful park and its surroundings. One of the most interesting aspects to it is that you experience a severe sense of",
          "This place has the best view of Port Elizabeth and it has so much culture. The Donkin Reserve is the best place to walk around and to relax. You can either sit on the grass and look at the National flag or go to the tower and climb to the top. The best time to be here is for the",

          "The true heart of Port Elizabeth historically. built in celebration of the 1820 settlers landing and turning the area into the commercial hub it is today. Built by the city founder Sir Rufane Donkin to celebrate the life of his then late wife. \"In the memory of one the most",
          "Please visit our Donkin Reserve and enjoy the beginning of my beautiful PE. Lovely art works and some lovely history are on display here. The tourism board has offices and you will find the girls friendly and informative. The views over the old city are gorgeous. The area can be",
          "Having lived in PE for 23 years you'd think I'd have already been there and done that. Not the case. Came for a quick visit with friends from Plett and was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful views of town and the Campanile from the top.",
          "Every day people travel around Port Elizabeth and you cant go past the memorial without popping round.The views from there of the bay are beautiful and if you can take the short tour round.",
          "The Donkin reserve is located on Port Elizabeth heart and worths a visit. It is a very calm and peaceful place, floor is full filled with mosaics that tells the story of the country. Here are a lighthouse that can be visit and with a lot of information and we could appreciate",
          "We went on the Donkin and read the memorial plaque that was placed by a caring husband for his wife. You need to see this for yourself ! A climb up the lighthouse was a struggle but well worth it",

          "Took my visiting family from Disley, Cheshire around the Donkin Reserve! My wife was brought up in the first house in the Donkin cottages and went to her first school in the Grey Institute. I met her on the corner opposite the Grand and the Edward Hotels 33 years ago! It is the",

          "I don't know what to say. It was nice and original to see a pyramid surrounded with some kind of art I have not seen before. Besides you have a lovely view of Port Elizabeth. Nevertheless I was not shocked. It was nice, not very nice...",

          "This is a pleasant short trip to see something in Port Elizabeth. It offers good views of the surrounding area",
          "Up on the \"hill\" in Port Elizabeth, this offers great views of the city and harbor. I love the inscription on the pyramid by Sir Rufane Donkin. You can go up the lighthouse for even better views. It is a well-kept, clean location worth visiting.",

          "There was a time that this was not a safe spot to visit. one would often get harassed by drug dealers. I decided to try it again. what a change. well laid out paths, plenty of fellow visitors, even more Tourist Ambassadors walking around. It offers excellent views of the city",
          "The view from the top is really nice. Always seems to be windy from on top there. Its a STEEP climb so be fit and have the right shoes on.",

          "Great view + interesting cut out metal art that becomes spectacular on a cloudy day. Because of it being on a steep hill recommend older people to enter from the top. For safety I suggest visiting between 9am & 4pm while it is busy,",
          "Took our sister-and-brother-in-law from Australia for a city walk around, was so great to see the place had been cleaned up so nicely and felt safe walking around which is a huge plus for visitors. The Madiba storyline - interesting, the mosaic art - well done and of course",
          "Truly the most educational monument in Port Elizabeth. My Grandchild loved it when he visited The Donkin Reserve on a historical tour of Port Elizabeth.",
          "We were only in Port Elizabeth overnight, so googled things to do; this came out top. It was an incredibly windy day, so much so that the military were having a huge fight trying to lower the flag for safe keeping! We visited the lighthouse and although the view from the top",
          "This was a memorable walk nobody should miss The art was amazing and this is a reserve not to be visited without a good camera.",
          "We took our foreign guests to see the Donkin Reserve one lovely Sunday afternoon. We witnessed the large SA Flag being lowered - very moving actually - were everyone stood and watched in silence. The Mandela metal works was impressive as was the mosaic art in the paved area",
          "Wonderful old history of PE as you get into the city centre and 67 Mandela art works, it's like a park with coffee shop surrounded by old hotels and the Opera house plus galleries, places of interest. Beautiful views and no charge",
          "After living for five years in Port Elizabeth and returning to this city many times since we returned to Europe we always experience the Donkin as the place where it all started in 1820 when the Settlers arrived from the UK. Also the surrounding Victorian houses time you back to",
          "Definitely a sight for the history buffs but also some pretty monuments old and new. I love taking photos, and so enjoyed this area which also affords a great view over the city and harbour",
          "The old Donkin has undergone a major revival with impressive artworks bringing the precinct to life in an interactive way -\"well done to all involved!",
          "One truly needs to visit the reserve and marvel at the different artworks on the Route 67 heritage route. The reserve consists of the gardens, the lighthouse and a 10-meter high memorial pyramid. The pyramid was erected by Sir Rufane Donkin in memory of his late wife Elizabeth,",
          "The Donkin Reserve went through a neglected phase during the 80's and 90's, where not much attention was paid to the site, nor tourists' safety. Urban blight too, with a lack of proper maintenance, saw the Reserve littered, unkept and home to vagrants. I was so pleased to note",
          "This place is a hidden gem. There are lots of beautiful public artworks on display. The Lighthouse, the Pyramid and the metal sculptures are fantastic. In addition, you will find a wonderful coffee shop and a stunning view of the city.",
          "Historical monument to Lady Donkin. Also worth seeing is the mosaic tiles which are very well done. Really worth the visit.",
          "We always take visitors to Donkin. It is a bit tucked away and a lot of people do not know about it, but well worth the visit. A lot of money and effort has been spend by the municipality to upgrade the whole area. The views from the lighthouse is amazing and you can learn a lot",
          "Take some time to stop by this park. Lots of history here. Beautiful artwork. I recommend walking around the metal sculpture.",
          "As part of the history of Port Elizabeth, this is an imperative and compulsory stop when travelling in and around the city. Not only is the view great, the history of the area is important in understanding its relevance.",
          "it was a very relaxing afternoon. me and my family had a lot of fun. would go again in the near future.",
          "So glad we visited it this time. Beautiful views, and with the celebration of Nelson Mandela's life in art just a stone's throw away it was a real trat. I find the area to be safe, with many visitors during the dag. There are very historic buildings close by. Will be back.",
          "This area within the heart of Port Elizabeth is an interesting and beautiful urban space. The reserve commemorates Elizabeth Donkin, for whom the city is named. There are also contemporary art pieces celebrating Nelson Mandela. There is a park and the area is safe during the day",
          "The Donkin Reserve is a place steeped in history, memory and love as well as dedication of the People of South Africa to their ideals. It is also a nice view point on the port and the City. The Route 67 starts nearby. Several historic buildings are also near there. A park garden",
          "The Donkin Reserve truly is one of Port Elizabeth's iconic attractions. A great combination between old and new with the historic lighthouse and pyramid standing side by side with the Route 67 public art pieces. The view from the lighthouse must be one of the best in the city.",
          "You don't need that much time here but it is well worth the visit to see the memorial pyramid to Elizabeth Donkin in whose honour the city was named. Alongside to pyramid is the original lighthouse, and the other way there is a very very tall flagpole. We were told that an",
          "Since my last review, I've visited the Donkin Reserve several times and recently had a young Argentinian visitor who wasn't really interested in the beaches...he wanted history and buildings! Awesome! So we did a lot of the Rooute 67 and happily, it was a weekday when the Donkin",
          "It is so nice to wander around this monument and read up on the attraction . It is a good condition and is very accessible . It is an iconic place in PE and should be visited",
          "One of the few attractions PE has on offer, and worth the visit. Its not too far from the beach and hotels, stop by if you can",
          "The Donkin Reserve is a very well kept area of Port Elizabeth. It can be easily identified by the tall flag pole and flag. However the place has limited shade and can be unbearable hot for some visitors. However a low light time of the day, the reserve is quite a treasure to",
          "High over the city this vantage point, which also boasts the highest flag-pole in the Southern hemisphere, has a pleasant tea-shop and a visitor information centre.",
          "We made a brief visit to Donkin Reserve during our visit to Port Elizabeth. The sculpture of Nelson Mandela and other people is a good photo opportunity. Other interesting public art within the reserve includes the pyramid and different forms of street arm. The area is exposed",
          "Nice to spend time looking at all the Art Works on display . Unfortunately it is not safe to be on your own here as there is a criminal element around this area. Some lovely photo opportunites",
          "The Donkin Reserve area has been upgraded and has a beautiful historical walk. Great view of the city and the harbour. Take a picture with Mandela art work and feel the history of South Africa. Have a meal or coffee across the road. Would be great if more was done to attract",
          "This is a bit of a tricky review because of my personal history with the place... Now it is an interesting place to visit and if it's your first time in PE, it is a must. Unfortunately it is not very well 'cared for' but you can get a sense of the history by reading and",
          "I recently visited the Donkin Reserve and it was very nice the way it was set out overlooking the Port Elizabeth Bay Area. The Donkin also has a coffee shop and they have the best cuppacino in town i reckon. There is also a trail which leads down to the city which I did not take",
          "This is an open area in the historical heart of the city. There is so much history around the Donkin that you can almost feel it. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "This is such a gorgeous gorgeous piece of our heritage but the municipality has no idea how to maintain it. Art walk is so clever and the walkways are pretty. Just a pity that what is left of a beautiful \"park\" is just weed and stone. Story of Elizabeth Donkin is very romantic",
          "Wonderful views across the bay. Interesting sculptures, grassy area to relax, friendly locals. Easy parking. Go up the lighthouse - it's definitely worth the nominal fee and steep stairs.",
          "I have coffee at the coffee shop every 6 weeks while my wife is at the hairdresser. I sit, outside, facing the southern Beaches. the service and the coffee is great. The view is amazing on a clear day. It is a pity that there is so much smog. I have also climbed to the top",
          "We stopped by at the end of our two day visit to PE. The views of PE from up there, especially the harbour and the cranes were magnificent. The mosaic and other works of art where quite humbling, especially the Nelson Mandela piece. The general history on Donkin, his wife, etc.",
          "If you are a tourist in PE, this is definitely a place to visit to get some insights about the city. A beautiful view awaits you from the lighthouse and as a South African you can't help but feel proud when you see the largest flag in SA displaying beautifully in the PE wind.",
          "This is a good place to start your sightseeing of PE as there is a Visitor Centre and Coffee Shop. The lighthouse, built in 1861, stands proudly and Pyramid Memorial has a very touching inscription to Sir Rufane Donkin's wife, Elizabeth. The Great flag (12m X 8 m) flies from an",
          "While following the full Donkin Trail is a bit daunting, you can see a lot in a morning or afternoon and get a feel for the history of Port Elizabeth. Pick up the trail map and commentary in the Visitor's Centre, put on your walking shoes and hit the trail. Just spending an",
          "definitely a place to be on a sunny day, the little restaurant serves great coffee and scones with strawberry jam. the R5 to climb the lighthouse is well worth the view, not for the fainthearted and found the stairs to be quite tiring.",
          "Aside from the Donkin reserve being a historical site in Port Elizabeth. If you have small children, they will enjoy meandering on the vast green lawn leading up to site. One can also just relax and read a book. It is notoriously famous for muggers though, so only go if there",
          "Beautiful views with lots historical insights into the city. Views across the whole bay. lovely area to picnic and ake breathtaking photos."

        "wiki": "The Porsche Museum is an automobile museum in the Zuffenhausen district of Stuttgart, Germany on the site of carmaker Porsche.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original Porsche museum opened in 1976 in a side-road near the Porsche factory. It was a relatively small works museum with little parking space and it was only big enough to hold around 20 exhibits (in rotation).\nPorsche built the museum as a kind of \"rolling museum\" with rotating exhibits from a stock of 300 restored cars, many in pristine condition and still in full driving order. Originally there was discussion that the new museum would be built alongside a new Mercedes-Benz museum on former trade fair grounds in the Killesberg area of Stuttgart. After the new Mercedes-Benz Museum opened in the east of Stuttgart in 2006, Porsche went ahead with plans to upgrade and extend its museum in the northern district of Zuffenhausen next to the company headquarters. Originally costs were set at 60 million euros but days before the official opening ceremony on 29 January 2009, it was confirmed that the actual costs hit 100 million euros.Work on the concept for the new Porsche Museum began in 2003. A storyboard comprising relevant topics, exhibits and their presentation was drawn up and a permanent exhibition was designed.\n\n\n== The new museum ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe new Porsche museum stands on a conspicuous junction just outside Porsche Headquarters in Zuffenhausen. The display area covers 5600 square metres featuring over 80 exhibits, many rare cars and a variety of historical models.\nThe museum was designed by the architects Delugan Meissl Associated Architects. The exhibition spaces were designed by HG Merz who was also involved in the building of the award winning Mercedes-Benz Museum.On October 17, 2005 the construction of the museum was officially kicked off. The 8 December in 2008 the museum was handed over to the client and opened one month later, 28 January officially. Since 31 January 2009 it has opened its doors to visitors.The result is an exhibition that focuses firmly on the vehicles showcased. All ancillary architectural, media and typographic elements are designed to be unobtrusive and complement the cars.\nThe museum, which is as flexible as it is exclusive, functions as a home base for the vehicles.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\n\n== Selected exhibits ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of automobile museums\nMercedes-Benz Museum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nMcCowen, David (26 September 2014). \"Feature: The Porsche museum\". drive.com.au.

          "The Porsche museum was excellent and really enjoyed all of the history and great selection of old vehicles. The thing that you need to know is you need to call ahead or email them to make a reservation for the factory tour which will cost you about \u20ac10. The factory tour was",
          "Went with a colleague to look around the Porsche Museum. Unfortunately it was closed on the day we went (every Monday closed) so we opted to take the tour around the Factory instead. Worth noting that due to Covid-19 they were thinking of closing the Museum for an undefined",
          "An amazing museum for anyone interested in the history and development of one of the world's most iconic car manufacturers. Good multi-lingual audio guide included in admission price. Easily accessible by public transport (U-Bahn) from centre of Stuttgart. If you can, also take",
          "Amazing place that has many porsche cars varying from different models and many 911's. It was great to get very close to the Porsche Carerra GT",
          "Real nice exhibit and very affordable. Children loved playing in the simulator. I loved the explanations on technical innovations by Fredrick Porsche and his company. Audio tour for free.",
          "If you live for porche you should go History of travel much more at the Mercedes museum and at the porche museum mainly porches bit a thrilling experience",
          "If you are a Porche fan, this for sure is a place of your pilgrimage. It is not big (not so big as the Mercedes-Benz Museum in the same city), so you can well finish it in 2 hours. But it indeed collects samples of all cars developed by the Porche family. Here, besides those",
          "Went there with my 2 sons of 4 and 9 years old and had a great time!! There are 2 911\u2019s where you can sit behind the wheel, 2 racing gameplays, nice personnel and an awesome collection at display! Sadly the Sally porsche 911 from the Cars movie wasnt on display, because of a",
          "I've loved Porsche ever since I was a kid so to see the museum was amazing. So many incredible cars, and I love all the variants of the 911. I spent just over a hour here, but could have stayed for a long longer if I wasn't in so much of a rush. Well worth a visit of you love",
          "As a Porschephile it was a Holy experience for me. Without a doubt, Do the Private Tour. It was worth 10X the price. My guide was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about Porsches. He shared his enthusiasm with me and actually climbed onto the displays and allowed me to",
          "At 17.00 you can buy half price entrance tickets. Museum closes at 18.00 - really enough time - unless you are a great fan of the brand and you need to stop much time are every single car. Many great cars obviously, if you are in town, you may consider to go. Surely I won't",
          "Simply fabulous and the 911 factory tour is a must ( but book early). A couple of nice restaurants and a coffee shop are convenient too. Only complaint is that if you tell people not to take in mobile phones on factory tour - why isn\u2019t this policed? Volume on multimedia tour",
          "You'll want to buy a Porsche after visiting this museum. Go next door and price out the new ones at the dealership. Even the concept cars are on display and if you can tear yourself away from the model car track races, you'll learn alot about the inventors and designers.",
          "Incredible! Staff excellent, cars perfection. Exactly what you would expect from the best car manufacturer in the world. Alex Constantine England",
          "We came here with 30 minutes before closing and we bought tickets with only 2 euros each. Interresting museum if you like cars but not very big overall. Souvenirs shop at the entrance is available. Also they have a small restaurant.",

          "I did an amazing tour of the factory better than I thought it was going to be. Then I visited the museum. I was impressed at the collection displayed. All kinds of car you can only see in magazines, video, or movies I never believed I would be able to see them in person simply",
          "If you're into sports cars, the reason for your trip to Stuttgart has to be Porsche. No trip is complete without it. The museum is small compared to that of Mercedes but it still captures the heart and essence of the Porsche brand. You're given an audio guide as you start and",
          "Maybe not as impressive in terms of scale as the Mercedes Benz museum, but still very interesting and worth paying a visit. Very convenient location - meters away from an S-Bahn stop, the building is very beautiful too.",
          "Cool place if you are into cars, and not necessarily Porsche. There is a free underground car park. Entry is cheap. 4 Euro. Lots if cars the history of the product is explained. Also nice place to eat if you want.",
          "For a Porsche fanatic like me, this is a Mecca and must see. I need to say no more but come visit and see for yourselves!",
          "Excellent facilities, with **lots** of vintage racing cars and models on display. Compared to BMW Welt, Porsche was solely a museum! No current models on display, no interactive learning/educational displays. I assumed it was \"Porsche World' -- like BMW World in Munich. So in",
          "I absolutely love the journey the Porsche museum sends you through when you visit from its begins up until today with its crazy high end racer cars. They did an amazing job telling its story, showing you all they super cool cars created through the years, and it was pretty",

          "The Porsche Museum is kind of an obvious destination for tourists in Stuttgart. It's pretty cheap (8 Euro for adults; 4 Euro for seniors) and definitely worth the price. Lots of historic cars and car components in perfect condition. One nearly hundred-year-old car looked like it",
          "I'm not that into cars or particularly Porsche, but really enjoyed this museum. Very nice cars, cool interactive experiences, you can sit in 3 type of Porsche. It's a great couple of hours. We were enough to buy group tickets, but full price tickets are not expensive compared to",
          "It is well designed and well organized museum. Adult ticket costs 8\u20ac including audio guide. It starts from the 2th floor and you can see each item by walking on a cylindirical path. It was an amazing experience for me. It is (at least) 1-1,5 hours needed to visit this place",
          "I enjoyed this museum and it really provides a great history of Porsche. It I had time to visit only one car museum, I would choose the Mercedes museum, as its much larger and their is so much more history. Regardless, if you can go to both, do it, as it was very nice.",
          "We visited the Porsche Museum for the factory tour. To begin the tour, we met our guide at the front desk of the Porsche Museum. We had to turn in cell phones and cameras prior to beginning the tour. Additionally, they have lockers for which you'll need a 1 euro coin to operate.",
          "We came to Stuttgart to hire a 911 for the week, in late October. We chose the hardtop, Carrera 4S, with PDK, sport mode, adjustable suspension, and sports exhaust. The car specs were important for us, and we got exactly what we asked for. We left for Switzerland and Austria,",
          "this is the second time we have visited the first time was when this museum had first opened previously we had visited the old museum in the factory grounds this is a lovely open plan museum you have the complementary audio guides which you can scan each exhibit and it will",

          "The museum is excellent. But, what made our visit was having a guided tour in English. We turned out to be the only couple on the tour and our guide was Lin, I think. She is originally from Beijing and studied in Stuttgart and remained there to work. She took us through the",
          "Took my husband as a birthday surprise in July 2017. Also booked a Porsche Drive experience which was amazing! I wasn\u2019t really bothered about going to the museum beforehand but I was pleasantly surprised! It would be good if there was a bit more interaction or cars to sit in",
          "If you are a Porsche fan, this is a fantastic collect of Porsche\u2019s and a must go. New, old, street, race, historical.... a complete collection. But a warning- The person who designed the facility seems to have not understood what a \u201ccar person\u201d is so the museum facility is",
          "It is a very nice museum. Not very big but has lots of cars to see. Make sure to sign up for the factory tour in advance.",
          "Really interesting museum. Loved the current 917 exhibition. Lots of porsches to drool over and you can sit in a couple of cars. The cafe and coffee bar are reasonably priced and the food was nice. If you get time go on a tour of the factory for extra drooling",
          "Porsche cars are quite cool, makes you wonder why 80s designs are not produced anymore. But the story through the exhibition is definitely not as cool as the one you get at Mercedez.",
          "Yes we went to Stuttgart purely to go here for our annual boys trip. Best way as well in our \u2018old\u2019 Boxster driving through Germany to test her. The museum is great. When you arrive you see more Porsches then you have ever seen before as there is one of the biggest dealerships",
          "Our factory tour was on a Monday which meant the Museum was closed BUT as the directions said,the gate was opened and we parked in the garage. W got there early so we walked across the street to the dealership for awhile.Tour leader was excellent and we spent 3+ hours walking",
          "Very nice place with all Porsche models especially race cars, also riding one was a very interesting experience",
          "Visually quirky and interesting Museum building located opposite the Porsche car factory and Porsche showroom. Friendly and welcoming staff. A must visit for motorsport, petrolhead and Porsche fans alike. The only slight downer was we visited in August when the factory was",
          "Must see. Just returned from the Porsche Driving Experience Germany. E-ticket all the way and fall is the perfect time. Catch octoberfest, eat and drink like the locals. Only drawback is smoking.",
          "We spend all day in the museum, we loved the cars and the layout. Und could even sit in two exposed models.",
          "Intimate and full of great informations over autos. Nice models exposed and well maintained. Good environment and audio guide with photos, videos, data. I did the factory visit too and I recommend the experience (look for it by email to buy in advance).",
          "First let me say that I am not into cars. They are simply a way to get from point a to point b. Our son is obsessed with cars. My husband is somewhere in the middle. That said, I had an amazing time at the Porsche Museum. It is well laid out, interesting, perfectly presented,",
          "Beware you will NOT be able to enter the factory UNLESS you have Reservations FIVE weeks prior. The Restaurant food is terrible bad and so is the Service. The Shop is really deficient.",
          "Porsche-Museum you should visit this museum if you like cars it as a great history and you can learn a lot.",
          "As fantastic as the Porsche Museum is the factory tour was even more interesting. It was quite impressive to see how these great cars are made in the heart of Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. Our guide was technically knowledgeable, humorous, and dedicated to making our experience truly",
          "Interested in car races like Formula 1? Then a visit here is a MUST. You can see all the racing cars of Porsche, the winners in Le Mans' 24hours races, Indianapolis etc. But the Porsche engine is not only in racing cars, but even in tractors or police cars or fire engines. And",
          "This was a very cool museum for the Porsche lover from the impressive sculpture at the entrance and the museum layout that takes you from Porsche's beginnings all the way up to the new and gorgeous Taycan. We finished the day with a tasty snack and a nice cold drink from the",
          "The Porsche Museum is an automobile museum in the Zuffenhausen district of Stuttgart, Germany on the site of carmaker Porsche. Inside the Porsche historic cars is displayed and have a store shopping for buy gifts!",
          "Visited here whilst on a weekend break to the Cannstatter Volksfest. Excellent location wise, right next to the UBahn stop. Really well laid out museum with just enough exhibits to keep you occupied without getting bored with the same thing. All of the displays are well laid",
          "Very interesting especially regarding the history of F. Porsche and the early years before the Porsche company, the involvment in the Volkswagen ect. Surprised to learn that the first \"car\" he built was an electrically powered wooden carriage. But the exhibits after the",
          "Got a bit confused by the parking, the parking is under the museum, and for 4 euros you can validate the ticket at the museum entrance. Not overly busy, good access to all the nice vehicles, very well laid out. Not very many toilets inside for the size and volume of guests.",
          "We go by U Bahn. It is very convenient from Train. We had lunch at Coffee Shop. We are very exciting at Museums.",
          "Easy transportation Great architecture building Many cars to see 8\u20ac for a 60'-90' (maximum) visit - not sure of worth",
          "Beautifully done museum with a focus on Porsche motor sports and development of their most famous cars and technology. Interactive segments, special exhibits, gift shop, modern design, forward looking. We liked it much better than the Mercedes museum which had a much bigger",
          "After coming from Mercedes museum we received a discount on entrance at Porsche (if you have your Mercedes ticket). This museum was also great, really outlining the history of the brand and providing audio guidance. Not only does one see great cars but you learn so much about",
          "First off you can park in the garage and take the elevator right up to the museum. The cost to park was 4 Euro. Bring your ticket with you up to the museum and you can pay for it when you get your entrance tickets. There was a special display going on while we were there. It",
          "If your kids are not interested or your wife is not interested do not take them there. The place is like the mecca for Porsche fans. When you are in there you do not need any distractions. It is like being in another world . Its like Maverick going to Top Gun its the cream of",
          "Honestly, It's a good museum if cars are your thing. But with the Mercedes-Benz museum so close by, it's impossible to hold the two next to each other and not compare. Porsche doesn't have the same breadth of history to draw from, so that's one thing. However, I'd also say the",

          "The museum is extremely well managed (as you would expect) and is in the heart of the Porsche manufacturing complex. Train station drops you off right at it. For only 4 euros, you can easily burn a couple of hours. If you love Porsches, they are all here. If you don't know",
          "Everybody has heard of the car manufacturer of Porsche, this museum, which is celebrating it's 10th anniversary at the time of writing. This is great place to spend a few hrs, wondering around. The printed items are all in both German and English, also most staff are",
          "I am a huge fan of Porsche, so I was really excited when I figured out I had spare time. The building looks cool from the outside. The exhibits were OK. Basically it's telling the Porsche story beginning from Mr. Ferdinand's time. It shows you the historical car, some",
          "Booking the tour 2 weeks in advance and it was a problem for them to give us a date for English tour which we never got. Cars display was okay but nothing to shout about only bothered to take 3 photos. Lots of better things to do than visit this place.",
          "This place is absolutely amazing for anyone interested in automobiles. The history of the company is very well captured in the cars and memorabilia display. The museum has an open plan structure. You can expect to find all the different models of Porsche on display. There are a",
          "Have been coming to Stuttgart for many years but this was the first time we had an opportunity to see the Porsche Museum. Really worth it. I hadn't appreciated that Porsche is essentially a post-WWII company. If you like seeing racing cars, its a must see. I am not a car guy per",
          "We spent 3 hours here and enjoyed every moment. The cars are well set out and the audio guide extremely good and informative. It is so easy to get there too which was an added bonus. A day well spent.",
          "Don't get me wrong- the exhibition itself it's quite wide and informing, but at every step you feel like you are being convinced, that this is THE MOST powerful engine of the 70s, that this team was THE FASTEST at Le Mans, and that the Porsche was, is and will be the absolutely",
          "Being and having been the proud owner of a 911 1969 and a912 1966 I loved the place, got there early, plenty of parking, very short line for tickets., don\u2019t forget discount if you\u2019re over 60. Staff around the displays where keen to talk to you and the displays where beautiful",
          "If you are into cars it's the place to go. See the history and many variations of Porsches. You will also find out how Porsche was involved with WW ll",
          "I came here for the first time, but I can't tell you how wonderful this place is, from Old Porshe to the evolution of new ones.",
          "Awesome museum. I liked it a lot than the Mercedes one. You get a 50% discount if you have a day train ticket. So the museum price is only 4\u20ac. Quite a deal. You will be awestruck with different porsche models and you can stand next to it and click pictures as if you own it.",
          "As a fan of all things motoring and as we were doing a Euro road trip, we thankfully made a pit stop in Stuttgart. I know there is a Mercedes museum, but I had to choose one or the other. Thankfully I made the right choice as this was a brilliant museum. As a Volkswagen",
          "We have driven all the way from Frankfurt to Porsche Musuem in Stuttgart for around 2 hours (195 km), Its worth it without a doubt, I was impressed to see the history of Porsche and how they started, you can see all the old Porsche Cars and all these fast machines produced by",
          "An interesting range of cars to look at and good videos telling the story of Porsche very comprehensively. There was a lovely interactive bit where you could sit in some of the cars and play a racing sim. Like the Mercedes museum there was an audio guide to listen to as you",
          "Great building, cool cars. However, very small and minimized exhibition. Even the shop is very small... Mercedes museum is much better...",
          "Parking was easy and there was no line to get in. We spent a hour there. Lots of great cars and a good story behind the entire place. I wouldn\u2019t go to far out of your way to see this unless you are a huge Porsche fan.",
          "Interesting place. A lot of cars from the beginning until today. Very detailed audio guide in multiple languages.",
          "Rented a Panamera from the Porsche museum was the highlight of our Europe trip. Zooming down the A8 to Munich and back was one of the best driving experience we ever had, and it's just within 500km of the allowed distance in the package. Car was almost new in perfect",
          "We visited the Porsche, Mercedes and BMW museums while in Germany. Our favorite was the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart. If you have only time for one car museum in Stuttgart and do not have a favored brand, go to the Mercedes-Benz museum. Now if you have the time (really",
          "if you love cars, this is the museum for you! I wish I could drive every car here. Iconic design Porsche is the most pure sports car ever in the history of cars! old too new, they have everything on display and the design of the museum itself is a testament to Porsche and",
          "We visited here today and we all enjoyed it. We all learnt so much and the kids enjoyed all the interactive stuff. It was just a shame that the shop was so expensive as the kids would have loved a souvenir but mugs, golf balls etc were a crazy price!",
          "Small museum in a large building and for the amount of profit they do, truly disappointing. A lineup of cars, a few sad sounds effects, and then of course a huge gift shop! There is a promotion for 20% discount if one visits the Mercedes museum (which is beautiful and no",
          "Although smaller than the Mercedes museum it\u2019s still good. No need to drive as the S Bahn stops right outside. The building itself is impressive and houses a great display of cars. Easy to navigate around with clear explanations on each vehilcle. A great visit.",
          "Visited the Porcshe museum with my partner and son whilst on holiday on Stuttgart and opted for the audio guides. We were impressed with the amount of vehicles on display in such a small area however it was poorly laid out with no way of really knowing what year range you were",
          "Three of the family could visit the museum. One had to stay driving in the car. Porsche Museum recommended special parking for larger cars. That parking was way around the building and in a extremely narrow lane, NOT at all suitable for larger cars. Se picture. It is one way",
          "So it is raining all day I get to Stuttgart on my motorcycle from the UK soaked I follow signs down into there CP, go up the lift buy an entry ticket \u20ac8 not expensive then they ask where I've parked and add \u20ac4 which is a bit of a cheek as they use part of the CP for there",
          "We rented a car in Munich and drove out to Stuttgart to visit the Porsche museum and Mercedes museum. Both are excellent! The Porsche museum took us about 1.5 hours, and is a must see if you're in Stuttgart, as well as Mercedes!",
          "hour and a half maybe; ten minutes of history; unless you are really into racing or a car guy/gal; not a big museum; parking underneath; high end restaurant serves American Prime Beef; interesting and candid assessment of WWII and Nazi involvement; MB Museum was much larger and",
          "You don't need to be a petrolhead to enjoy the Porsche Museum, the iconic cars are works of art! A must-see for visitors to Stuttgart, tickets very reasonably priced at 8 euros per adult.",
          "Loved the museum and we thought it was a perfect size and location for us! We enjoyed not only learning the history of Porsche but also seeing the different models and great looking cars!",
          "I liked it. I really didn\u2019t like Stuttgart that much, no Uber to get around, be ready because mostly all businesses refuse credit card payment. Not the museum museum is good.",
          "Actually this museum is a must visit for all automobile fans. Amazing experience seeing all the vintage cars and visiting their history.",
          "A very cool walk through the technological advances at the hands of Porsche. If you're in Stuttgart, even if you're not a car enthusiast, I recommend going.",
          "As a owner of a 911, the museum is a must see. Even more so is the Factory Tour we went on. A fantastic day that I will never forget.",
          "If you love cars and you love Porsche this will be your Disneyland! There's all sorts of great info about the cars and plenty of different models/types on display. The tour of the factory was very reasonably priced and very well-organised. Though I will say, it ran nearly an",
          "If you're into cars and happened to be in Stuttgart, then dont miss out on visiting the museum. Cars from all time periods and even super cars, i was amazed. Tired and hungry, just sit at the restaurant. Before entering i thought, gonna be there for 10 minute's, but ending",
          "My title should say it all. If you like cars and Porsche, go here. I am personally a BMW fan and have been to multiple automobile museums (including BMW) and this one is by far the best (Mercedes is a very close second followed by BMW in third). The best part is if you go to",
          "We went in a family trip and the kids wanted to see fast cars, so we took them there, and they loved it. They even had a VR experience unfortunately only for 18 and older, but also had aracing game for everyone. which obvioulsy the boys enjoyed. fully recommend for families and",
          "The new museum is fantastic. Really stylish and full of every type of Porsche. Lots of facilities with two restaurants, snack bar and lots of toilets. Reasonable entry cost and a must for every Porsche enthusiast. Give yourself at least two hours, more if possible.",
          "Went and visit this museum and was surprised by the whole thing, from the building structure to what\u2019s inside! Only thing is their caf\u00e9 could be a lot better. However when we rocked up and I tried really hard to get myself and a mate into the warehouse tour and we were very",
          "As a relatively small museum, they have packed a lot in. I went there to meet the legendary Urban Outlaw, Magnus Walker, who is every bit the Porsche warrior you'd expect. The museum itself is compact, but tells relates the history of the brand in logical and well set out",
          "This was an inspiring museum demonstrating the history of Porsche and all the models over the years. Even if you are not a Porsche enthusiast you will leave salivating how beautiful these cars are.",
          "It is not as big as one would expect. There is currently a promotion happening in coolaboration with Mercedes-Benz Museum. You can get a 25% discount on entrence fee if you visit both museums. The parking garage is 4 EUR.",
          "Enjoyed a visit with a tour group from my son\u2019s school. Visually appealing, friendly staff. We enjoyed reading about the history and liked the interactive displays.",
          "The building itself it is worth to be visited. It is not a huge museum that can be in fact be visited in 45 min but if you are a car lover you cannot miss it . They go from the very first PORSCHE units to the most modern ones . Do not miss the 356 spider or the emblematic 917 .",
          "From the beginning of vehicle development to recent vehicles including FAST cars. There's almost more eye candy here than one can handle. Don't miss it.",
          "Porsche museum is very good....if you are a car lover.....for me the restaurant was very good! My husband loved the 2 hours spent here.",
          "I ve seen all three car museums Mercedes BMW and Porsche museums They are all to be visited. A great history over there It is good that you may have a photo in a Porsche",
          "A lovely selection of Porsche from their creation. There are examples of all the classics and racing cars from 1898! The canteen was disappointing. And the gift shop was a non event. Parking can be quite a walk.",
          "Very nice museum that covers history up to relevant timeframe. I felt that the size of the museum is right. Not too big, and not too small. There are some amazing cars on display here, and I really liked all the racing history. The Porsche shop is also very good, with all",
          "We loved visiting the Porsche museum. Nice cars and you can spend quite some time enjoying the walk around. It's not as big as other museums, but it had enough to look at. The shop was a bit expensive, but what can you expect. We paid 49 euros for a t-shirt and 65 euros for a",
          "A fantastic representation of the history of Porsche with many models to view up close and personal.",
          "Very entertaining and educational Museum. If you love cars, you must stop here. You get to sit in some 2019 models, and there is an option to drive one. If you are in Stuttgart, you must stop here.",
          "I went there while in Stuttgart with my wife and really enjoyed the experience I thought it very good value for money and being a motoring enthusiast and Porsche owner I took my time looking at all the exhibits I took 2.5 hours while my wife took half the time and then sat in",
          "We had a great time at the Porsche museum last week. It is smaller than the Mercedes-Benz museum but just as beautiful and fun. Porsche has so much style, gorgeous. Apparently they have a huge inventory of cars so the exhibit changes often. We were able to go through in about an",
          "We enjoyed the visit, if driving be careful the gps doesn\u2019t take you to the staff car park as our did. We ate at the cafe which was pretty average and bit pricy",
          "Even if you are only a moderate car buff, the Porsche Museum is a \"must see\" when in the Stuttgart area. The company has a fascinating history. The audio devices that they provide offer a self-guided tour experience in your own language.",
          "Been to Lamborghini, and Ferrari. The Porsche one is by far the best. Fantastic architecture and the collection represents the full Porsche line-up and lineage. Reasonably priced parking and a cheap entry fee. Spent a full 4 hours here and could have lingered for longer. It was",
          "We visited this after the Mercedes Benz Museum. My husband loves Porsche so he was in heaven. I liked the racing history presented. You can spend couple of hours.",
          "The museum is truly amazing for anyone into Porsches. Beautiful building, easy to get to, with great staff. But what really floated my boat was the factory tour. OMG! Simply amazing and even for my Wife, whom I dragged there kicking and screaming. Porsche is soooo kind to let",
          "If you are a petrolhead like us then this place is the centre of the world. The must,must do is the factory tour that you need to precook. For only \u20ac12.50 you get a tour of the factory on a live running production line and a look around the museum. The production line is the",
          "I went to museum on a saturday afternoon and was busy. Exhibition is great and large, well explained. You will need at least 2 hours moving fast to pick all details. Porsche offers also a tour to the factory (reservartion in advance by email)",
          "This could not be closer to the S Bahn station! Really friendly staff who gave us 50% off for arriving by public transport (it cost 4 euros each). We had brought tickets from the merc museum as I\u2019d read you get 25% off, but this was a much better deal! Contained a good amount",
          "Honestly I expected much more. Nice building especially the exterior. The number of cars is really small compared to the Mercedes ones and the cost of the ticket higher. If you are really a fun of Porsche then this is a must ...",
          "I have read a lot about Porsche but decided to visit the museum and do a Porsche Factory Tour. This was by far the best and most organized guided tour of an incredible factory. From the moment we were received to the thank you from our guide at the end of the tour. The Museum",
          "This museum is interesting enough. But if you are between this and the Mercedes museum, then go to the second one which is really awesome. If you are a Porsche fan, Porsche museum won\u2019t disappoint you. It\u2019s really good and the architecture is great.",
          "This museum is a must see for any car fan, and especially for the fans of one the most amazing cars of the all, the Porsche. World class exhibits and interactive displays tell the story of Ferdinand Porsche and how the company came to be. The museum includes a nice restaurant",
          "First of all, the museum is beautiful with a wide collection of cars throughout the years. If you are really into Porsche and curious about the whole production process, take the factory tour! You will see a variety of production areas with a close up view and the final",
          "Nice place to visit if you like cars. Museum is not really big but be prepared to spend there for couple of hours. Entrance fee is only 8 eur and really worth it. Easy access by undergound.",
          "First of all the museum is very easy to get to as it effectively has its own S Bahn station which is adjacent to the museum. The museum is also large and so can swallow up a large number of visitors so it doesn't seem too crowded. The exhibits chronicle the history of Porsche,",
          "One of the most spectacular car museums in the world. Extremely easy to get to - I went via the metro train on the S6 (Brown Line) from Stuttgart to Neuwirtshaus (Porscheplatz). You step off the train and there is the museum. It was opened in 2009 & the building has a",
          "Porsche museum is great for enthusiasts but also very good for non-petrolheads. We visited it and the Mercedes museum on same day which gives benefit of a discount on entry fee. Mercedes one does more on the history of the car in general as well as Mercedes specific. Porsche",
          "Definitely a must see for any car enthusiast while visiting Stuttgart. The Porsche complex (museum and factory) have their own train stop right in front, so is extremely easy and accessible. The museum itself had many milestone/historic Porsche's inside and was a wonderful",
          "The Porsche Museum is very easy to get to by train. Buy an all day pass and get 50% off the Porsche Museum and Porsche Factory Tour. The total cost for 2 people was 20 euros, a bargain. The Museum is well laid out with lots of history and cars. Book ahead for the factory",
          "The English audio display handset didn't work for about half the exhibits. I even traded out the handheld unit once to see if that was the issue. Same problem. If you want to go on the factory tour there is an 8 week waiting list. Too bad. 20 euro for two tickets and parking.",
          "By-far the best of Stuttgart. You just fall-in love with this place the moment you come out of station. The three car monument in front of the Museum is out of this world. Once you enter, you know what a person lives for in this world. The best collection of cars that you one",
          "I took guests from India and China to this impressive location. Its a walk through car manufacturing and var racing history they will never forget. Its a perfect place to spend an afternoon. A location, visitors to Germany and Stuttgart will never forget!",
          "This was our second visit. Both times were different but awesome at the same time. The second visit we got to experience the virtual tour of Mission E electric concept car. The display of the 70 anniversary was really impressive. Will come back if we get the chance.",

          "Neatly organized with lots of impressive cars. History starts really with the \"Kugelporsche\", aka the VW Beetle. The museum guides you through decades of development, from the 356 in its different variations, over Tractors, racing and rally cars. And of course the 911 and all",
          "Everything a Porsche lover can expect to find is here. Dozens of emblematic models spanning the almost 90 years of Ferdinand Porsche\u2019s car design adventure. A definite must see in Stuttgart!",

          "A great way to spend a rainy day. The multimedia displays appeal to all learning styles and are easy to follow even for younger audiences. The virtual experiences and being able to sit in actual Porsche vehicles are definite bonuses! I enjoyed the historical context of the",
          "By arriving at the museum you\u2019ll see the architectural miracle of the building. It seems like it\u2019s floating. I was literally looking at it with my mouth wide open! As you\u2019re entering the exhibition, you are watching the history and the developing of the firm. You will have the",
          "The Museum is not only for Porche lovers - it is a fascinating place to visit if you love cars. The lovely cars, and the information about them, makes for an informative, but pleasurable experience.The restaurant is also not bad for a quick snack and something to drink. A place",

          "Ok, cars a cool but the thought of a car museum doesn't really get me excited. But sometimes, you the have to compromise. Hahaha! Afterall, he had done a teddy museum the previous day for the kids (and me). Anyway, getting there by train from the HBF is super simple. One train",
          "If you like there sporty cars you will love it here. The story of Ferdinand and Ferry and FA Porsche was endearing, the evolution of brand and cars..we Enjoyed but everyone in our family has one. We Did think the building architecture and the decade by decade breakdown was",

          "Even if you are not a fun of sport cars, you will be excited by the Porche Museum. You can spend around 2-3 hours seeing a quite big collection of sport cars and not only. There are also tractors, military cars and others. Moreover, the augmented reality experience was a plus.",
          "This was a great stop on our trip from Munich to Prague. The self-guided tour was about an hour or so. Just the right amount of time. Nice headsets for different languages. Nice place to eat also for lunch.",

          "I am thrilled that we stopped by the museum on our visit to Germany. The building design alone is worth seeing. They did a great job on showing the history and the art of the Porsche brand. Make sure you stop here when in the area.",
          "We had a great experience up close to the production lines at the Porsche Factory Tour. We walked around the lines missing the AGV (auto guided vehicles) and watching the production workers put together the cars. We covered the assembly line, the engine line and the upholstery",
          "We went to this historic place during our vacations in Germany. Indeed hat a great time in the Porsche museum with lots of attractions and some really rare cars!

          "Keep in mind I am not a car-lover... I thought this was a fine museum with a lot of brilliant cars, worth a visit if you have the time and are interested. But if you're tight on time and/or money, then don't feel too bad about cutting this out and head straight to the Mercedes",
          "Interesting history with good selection of cars. The restaurant was very good, but very expensive, so be prepared to spend.",
          "This is a unique place for the automotive lovers !!! All the original models are really nice in an environment absolutely in line with Porsche style",
          "Visited museum and showroom. If you like speed and stylish cars then this is the right place, Muesum has lots of concept and racing cars, the best part is Muesum building is morden and stylish like their cars. 1. Don't forget to collect free magazine at the entrance. 2. You",
          "Fantastic Museum for Learning Porsche great tradition and innovations. I really love the cars exhibition and also the car model created for the Disney movie Cars.",
          "Very interesting museum. Shows cars from beginning to brand new. A must visit for all even those that are not car enthusiasts.",
          "Highly recommended it, for the people who loves cars. The most interesting thing for me is statue next to the Museum with the cars on the top of the monument.",
          "We managed to secure a next day factory tour while staying down in Freiburg. The staff where very welcoming and the tour guide very much engaging with those who where obvious enthusiasts, in fact he was a graduate on fast track training which gave us even more insight ! The",
          "Well worth a visit when in Stuttgart. Goes through history of Porsche, and showcase range of cars through the years including motor racing ones. Well laid out, easy to get to (more or less next to a S bahn station), couple of cafes on site. Well worth the visit..",
          "I like new cars and in this Museum they have a lot of those. Staff was very nice and polite. The Display and the collection were fantastic.",
          "28e for the three adults (anyone over 14 is an adult) the 12 year old was free. The kids (both girls) basically sat and played on their devices on the WiFi ... Hubby really enjoyed all the exhibits and now wants a Porsche ! I enjoyed the history:). Even if you are not a car",
          "When you are in Stuttgart you should visit both Porsche and Mercedes museums. I would recommend first to go to Porsche and afterward to Mercedes.",
          "Do not miss this, especially if you're a huge Auto fan. But even if not (like me), you will definitely appreciate the beauty of the design in the different models through the years. It's definitely time well-spent.",
          "Rich with history and vehicles from all eras throughout the Porsche evolution. Interactive exhibits for younger children and teenagers. The family ticket (\u20ac20 for 2 ad, 2 ch) included parking in the undercover car park. Audio tours are offered for free in German or English and",
          "It is a nice museum indeed, but If you have to choose between this one and the Mercedes museum - pick the other one. This one is less impressive and less organized.",
          "Great little museum if you are a Porsche lover \ud83d\ude0d Lots of cars to see and although you can\u2019t touch them there is one that the children (and adults) can sit in and have pictures taken in. Although not as fancy as the Merc museum there is a tour that you can book on to see",
          "Incredible history on display in this beautiful museum. You dont have to be a car lover to enjoy this. good for kids",
          "Perfect for an afternoon and for all ages. Feast your eyes on Porsches over the past century, and even get to try a simulator. Porsche 918 Spyder a modern highlight. Nice cafe and shop.",
          "We were impressed with the collection of rare Porsche cars. One of the centerpieces was a futuristic body built by Ferdinand Porsche in 1939 made all of aluminum. The museum provides audio guides for self-tours. There is a video documentary on Porsche's life which is",
          "This museum is amazing, the visitor can know all the Porsche history, from the early days to now. It is possible to see many race cars. I recommend to anyone, especially who love cars and engineering. If you go early in the morning, there are just a few people inside.",
          "Not much of a museum. Rather a great collection of porsches. Not much said about the history or pleasent inside information. We spent there less than an hour. I think it says enough.",
          "I have been to this museum a few days ago with my partner. Very nice exhibition with nice models presented. The explanations are good as well but being in the 21st century, I believe that it should be much more oriented \u201cinteractive\u201d and make it a true experience. Good enough",
          "As a Porsche F\u00e3 and Car Enthusiast, i really enjoy this museum...altough i found it rather small when compared with other car museum...",
          "While in Stuttgart to visit the Christmas markets, my husband wanted to also visit the Porsche factory and museum. We made reservations before we left the States to ensure we had a spot on the tour (we had heard how difficult it was to get a tour). Even though I'm not a fan of",
          "The Porsche museum is generally nice, very nice building, very fancy and the cars look great. It's small compared to the Mercedes-Benz museum, so there's also less content to explore there and learn about. I think you have to really be a fan of cars though in order to appreciate",
          "Just outside Stuttgart, fairly easy to get to via U-Bahn is the spectacular Porsche Museum building. We had a lovely warm welcome and discount offered with a three day railcard. The entrance fee is good value for money. Audio was ok but sadly not all the displays offered enough",
          "We visit this museum approximately once yearly because we have friends and family from abroad who visit us here and it is all the time part of our hospitality and showing Stuttgart to them... I am not biggest fan of cars, but it is interesting to see great mixture of the past",
          "Allow 3 hours to walk this museum. It spirals up from the oldest cars to the newest, with race cars on the left and street cars on the right. There are also Porsche tractors, jeeps, and more. Along the way, the included audio tour explains the history. It does include",
          "A way through the history of the company, with innumerable racing cars. Good, if you are a fan of them; if not, you may get tired. Interesting design of the buidling, easily accesible with public transport (just next to the stop of the local train, the S-Bahn).",
          "This museum is a Porsche lovers dream. It starts from the history for Porsche and covers everything from the start to todays current models. The cars on display are simply amazing to look at. The audio tour tells you everything you need to know about what you are viewing.",
          "Vroom, vroom, vroom, fun! This was an overwhelming exciting time. If you enjoy cars, most especially Porsche, this is a great experience. Wonderful museum.",
          "The family went to the museum and the report back was that it was very interesting but not really child friendly as they could not touch or look at anything - adult toy show really",
          "Well organized museum Would arrange for a factory tour at same time- must be done pre visit For something with the Porsche name the entire experience was very reasonably priced",
          "The museum itself (\u20ac8 adults, \u20ac4 concession) is easy to digest and is well worth a visit. The real highlight however is the tour of the factory buildings surrounding the museum, which requires booking online in advance (\u20ac6) and runs for about 2 hours. We were guided by a",
          "Here you will see the full history of Porsche cars, right from the very beginning to present day, Plenty of cars on display and enough to see and learn about the history of this famous car brand,Stunning architecture and exhibits, really easy to walk around and get photos",
          "As the macho name Porsche, has placed its name perfectly in the section of automobiles with a combination of old and new era vehicles. The elegance of each car brought huge smile on my face. Hats off Porsche.",
          "Visited here with my family at the end of November. What a fantastic place. If you are a Porsche fan then this is the place to be. If you hate them, go elsewhere. Here you will see the full history of Porsche cars, right from the very beginnings to present day. Next time I come",
          "Very interesting primarily focused on racing would not require more than 2 3 hrs so you can do in an afternoon if you are not interested in race cars and have tight schedule go for Mercedes Benz better",
          "Well, words really cannot describe this experience if you are an enthusiast who loves cars! But I will try, this museum is one stop place to know how Porsche evolved so many decades and one can see all generations (rather most of them) of their cars ever produced with some",
          "Take the S6 or S60 from Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof and travel approx 15 minutes by train to visit this museum. You will not be disappointed (as a car lover). Plenty of cars on display and enough to see and learn about the history of this famous car brand from Zuffenhausen. Entry is",
          "It's a very nice experience about the Porsche history and their fabulous cars. However, diferently of Mercedes Museum, this place is totally focused on cars, so if you love them, you will enjoy it.",
          "Stunning architecture and exhibits, really easy to walk around and get photos because the lighting is perfect and the are no big barriers in the way. Always things going on here, maybe avoid on a national holiday because of how busy it was. Overall surprised with the pricing on",
          "Nice and easy visit, walk around and admire the cars. It is easy access and parking, makes you dream...",
          "Even if you're not a fan of the brand, there's really cool stuff to see. Lots of interesting car designs. They go really in depth into the history and early engineering experiments. Lots of cars on display, really nicely restored and the exhibition space is well done. The",
          "Will take comparatively less time than Mercedes museum but is also very good and informative. Lots of cars of different models and all have the same expensive look, love at first sight.",
          "This was an amazing trip for us all. The factory tour was spectacular allowing you to see everything from engine manufacture to the finished products. A highly knowledgeable and professional guide who was clearly a Porsche fan - like the rest of us in the group. The museum",
          "We visited the museum and had a factory tour. I bought a new Porsche in Leipzig & this was a great experience visiting the factory & the museum. Parking is free under the museum, they give you a validated ticket. The cars on exhibit change every few days so wishing 6 months",
          "I wish I was a motor lover when I visited; however, unfortunately, I wasn't. Saying that, I think this place was rather educational for me",
          "A bit of an anticlimax after visiting the Mercedes museum, because nothing really compares to that. Nonetheless the Porsche Museum is nice, if nowhere near as big. (Of course the history is not as long.) Plus, if you have the necessary money, you can rent a car for a couple of",
          "Love the fact that they change the cars at the museum regularly. We had visited the year before but the displays were totally different. Did the factory tour too which is sensational. Although there were parts of it closed on this occasion as a new car was going around the line",
          "For all the Folks who are Porsche Fan (I'd rather say, For all the Folks who are Car Fan); its must Visit Museum in Stuttgart. Special Discount if you are already been to Mercedez Benz Museum before coming here... . :) At least when I Visited it was like that... . . Audio",
          "Went with my father in law last week and we throughly enjoyed the museum. The staff were courteous and friendly, the museum is well laid out and the place is spotless. The cafe is really clean and very good value. The shop was limited in what it sold and was very expensive. The",
          "I always enjoy visiting the Porsche Museum. The displays are well presented and the information touch tablets by most of the display offer a large amount of information to those really interested in the specifics of that display. The gift shop is tremendous with the selection of",
          "We spent a couple hours here last weekend. It is an excellent review of the Porsche history. They have made some spectacular cars and they are all on display here!!",
          "I've been a Porsche person for most of my life, so my opinion might be skewed. Not many cars on display, but most of the cars they had were impressive. Doesn't compete with the Mercedes Museum. The gift shop leaves a lot to be desired. Laid out poorly and could not find",
          "Found this museum to be a nicer format than the Mercedes museum. Every car here is still driven, they have a viewing area that allows you to see into their workshop as well. If you are lucky enough to be there when they fire up one of the classic 917\u2019s in the shop it can be",
          "One of the highlights of our trip. Had the best food in Stuttgart at all three restaurants. The art sculpture our front is worth the trip. Lots to see. Great gift shops. A must for any Porsche fan. Also toured the plant and it was amazing.",
          "If like me you like cars and bikes, this is a well presented museum and history of Porsche, there is free secure underground parking, get your ticket stamped when paying the entrance fee, the displays are excellently lit, which is great for making photographs, i cannot think of",
          "Easy to get to on public transport and the cars are presented beautifully in a very elegant space. Very reasonably priced and no extra charge for the audio guide (though it was a bit crackly at times). Well worth a visit, even if you're not a Porsche tragic. Our kids enjoyed it",
          "This museum was okay. I was there for my husband and my friends. The kids enjoyed the interactive features, and my husband loved seeing the different Porsche models. I just walked around and read some stuff. There were a few interesting bits for a non-car buff, but not much.",
          "We visited both the Mercedes and Porsche, if you have time, it's worth going to both, but if you have time for only one, the Mercedes museum is much larger and adds a lot of historical info as well as the auto history.",
          "Be prepared to spent at least 1-1.6 hours here if you are going to see all the displays of the Porsche cars, bike and the commercial vehicles and parts. The history journey is interesting. Book early for a guided tour in different languages. As we turned up impromptu, we only",
          "Convenient (but not well marked) under the museum. Inexpensive. Smaller than expected. Beautifully presented cars with some interactive exhibits. Excellent cafe for coffee and cake. We spent about 2 hours in the museum.",
          "Ok.. so first of all.. its a small museum. I dont even think its complete. But... its a really nice place and you get to see a lot of sports cars. Different models and timelines.. so yeah. Its a nice place. Sadly.. you dont really get to learn a lot about porsche in this",
          "The museum was well structured and the self guided touring electronic component was average at best the history and displays are amazing",
          "What a great place to spend some time with our two sons that are just getting into cars of their own. The museum has something for all ages really early cars for the enthusiasts to the sports cars for all of us that want a new toy to keep us young.",
          "If you are a car fan (and in particular if you are a Porsche fan) then this is a must see attraction, I just wish I had booked a museum tour to get the most from it. I spent three hours in the museum and loved every minute!",
          "If you just want to look ar great cars the Porsche Museum is for you. Not a lot of history of the industry, but great looking cars.",
          "We took the guided factory tour as well as went through the museum. No recording devices allowed on the factory tour but well worth the time. Very interesting. The museum itself has a nice cafe and gift shop on the first floor. Ride the escalator up to see the cars. Take",
          "great display and easy to get to via train. great shop and helpful staff. factory tour worth the trip also.",
          "Everybody when compare Porsche Museum with Mercedes Museum said that Mercedes is better, but I disagree! If someone asked me I should say: Depends... Depends what you want to see inside of a place which talk about car. If you would like to see the Porsche cars, from the old to",
          "It could not be easier to get here, the train stops right outside the museum, showroom & factory. If you are into Porsche or sports cars, then this is a must see. Also has shop & cafe.",
          "Really worth a visit. Great collection of vintage Porches, and the company's history. Visit the restaurant on top floor. One of Stuttgart's finest.",
          "I should preface this review by admitting that I am a total 'Porsche Tragic', and this was something of a pilgrimage for me. So I am going to be biased in my personal experience! If you aren't that into Porsche, or cars generally, I suspect your experience will vary greatly!",
          "For any Porsche fan, this is mecca, a real must see. Although a static museum, there is plenty of interactive displays, including a driving simulator. The cars on display are rotated regularly, so I will likely return to see what else they have hidden in their archives. The only",
          "Visit was good. audioguide is well done and convenient to use in front of displayed cars. Cars are displayed in a very nice museum. Architecture of the building is clear",
          "If you love cars and you are in Stuttgart you need to see the museum. This is a great attractions, it's a must.",
          "Not a huge museum but a good number of cars on show, a beautiful building and interesting information about the history",
          "If you love Porsche, it's a place to visit, they display many famous Porsche cars inside. They also have virtual experience car you get to ride which was fun!",
          "This was a great experience! I loved the setup of the museum. It really flowed and you never felt like you were lost or missing something. You can purchase a ticket for 8 Euro which includes an audio guide (offered in multiple languages). Then you are free to explore the museum",
          "What an inexpensive, well laid out museum. Really enjoyable, informative, and has something to offer even the non petrol heads. While a homage to the Porsche generations, I feel the museum does gloss over Porsche's part in the support of the nazi museum, which should rather",
          "As a lifelong German car enthusiast this was an amazing experience. A great collection of porsches across all eras. I had limited time as i was only able to spend a few hours before catching a flight but plan in advance and you can do a 2 hour tour of the factory as well (need",
          "As a Porsche fanatic I found the museum a fantastic experience. We had a great day looking at cars ..so rare they cannot be purchased in any place it the world.The history of the Porsche founders was amazing understanding where Ferdinand came from with no mechanical background.",
          "Absolutely well worth a visit, and make sure you have dinner at Christophorus restaurant, a real treat",
          "The Porche Museum in Stuttgart is a beautiful sight for your eyes. The building is a pleasure to see and the exhibition is well organized. From Porche tractors to Porche Police cars you could spend an entire day there. While there make sure that you go to the top floor where",
          "We loved the tour and Julia's knowledge was unbelievable. She made the tour even more interesting with her wonderful character! Thank you Julia for a job well done!!",
          "the Porsche museum is a must visit if you have even a slight interest in cars. Its great to see all the displays and staff are on hand to answer and questions/ explain anything to you!",
          "Interesting exhibits, but children get easily bored with the displays even with audio guides. Activities to engage children are on a fixed schedule so be sure to check the time of those activities before hand.",
          "Well worth the hype. My husband is a big Porsche fan and owns 2 of them. Walking through the museum also was very nostalgic as he remembered many of the cars when the were out. Reasonably priced and nice options to grab a bit to eat and a nice drink. We drove from Munich and",
          "The entry fee was not expensive and the museum takes you on a nostalgic trip through the life of the Porsche. The building is very modern with a Porsche inspired sculpture in front. There is a nice underground car park with large spaces which carries a charge. Lots of",
          "I've had the pleasure of owning quite a few German cars over the years, and to quote an advertisement from the '80's: \"Porsche... There is no substitute!\" This place is not to be missed by anyone with even a passing interest in cars, technology, engineering, or Architecture.",
          "Not a big museum it's more just about Porsche in comparison to Benz museum. Again more posh cars it's completely different to Benz museum.",
          "It's fun to see the people that pay about 200 euros for driving in one of the Porsches. The museum highlights the history of Porsche, but compared to the Mercedes Museum it's a bit small. If you go to both you can get a discount if you show your ticket at the other museum. My",
          "Not a major fan of cars but a cool place to visit. Shows you how Porsche has developed over time. If you want to have the Porsche driving experience you will need to book well in advance.",
          "I am not a big fun of Porsche design, but this visit changed it to the better. I was also very much impressed with the legacy of Ferdinand and Freddy Porsche - they left the mark much wider than just this brand with contribution to Daimler and VW, not speaking of other",
          "We loved the Porsche Museum. We drove through the windy roads through The Black Forrest. Many of the cars had mini stories about them. There was an area showing Videos of the racers with their stories. If you like cars, don't miss this.",
          "Don't need to spend too long here, not that wheelchair friendly, needed to wait for staff to show us how to get up. Need to book if you want to have lunch in the resturant",
          "The museum is terrific. Very reasonable and the audio guide was great. Took 2 teenagers and they loved it. We were there about 2 hours. Excellent museum",
          "Great museum even if you don't own a Porsche! A little over two hours was enough time to see everything, although if your a Porsche fan you could probably spend all day here!",
          "If you are staying for a short time in Stuttgart, then this place is a must. The fees are reasonable we where a group of 10, they wont charge for kids under 14 years, students get a special discount along with seniors, we paid 48euro for all of us. There is plenty of history",
          "The Porsche museum is smaller than Mercedes museum also in Stuttgart and you can see some Porsche models new and old but it does not pay a lot to the history of Porsche brand, especially older models which made the brand special and it has no interaction with visitors and",
          "That's an amazing iconic car's museum to learn about Porsche and the price for one ticket is very affordable. 8 euros",
          "Loved this, superb cars, amazing interesting museum. Told a fascinating story of the iconic car. Fun to spot your favourite.",
          "Love the history of Porsche. Lots of great cars to look at. New dealership across the street if your so moved. Definitely worth the trip.",
          "To be honest I found it smaller than expected. Some cars are interesting, especially the racing ones but half is street cars which I found only mildly interesting. The Mercedes collection in Stuttgart was way more impressive. We went through in about an hour, found that",
          "It rained this morning and the kids nagged us so long until we agreed to come here. They have a great time, it's still a fantastic museum, despite its age.",
          "I went to the museum with my two sons, one of which is a car fanatic. The whole place from the design of the building,the layout and of course the car's are all exemplary. It was very reaasonbly priced to get in, even the cafe wasn't over priced as is often the case with a",

          "Good value with under 14s free and 10Euros for adults. Lots for the Porsche enthusiast. Good cafe at the end. Clean, modern and informative museum. Can be done in 2-3 hours",
          "We drove to the Musem, as parking here is free if validated at the ticket desk. Although very busy the flow in an out were well matched and we had no problem parking quickly. The entire site is immaculately clean, even the car park. On entry we took the elevator up to the ticket",
          "The Porsche museum. What can I say its museum dedicated to the Porsche brand. As a motorsport enthusiast I absolutely loved my time there. They have a large collection which is frequently rotated according to the staff. They had examples of everything from the earliest days",
          "I am a regular visitor to Stuttgart and visited the old, original museum on a number of occasions and this new one 4 x times As stated by other visitors, it does NOT have the VARIED appeal of the Mercedes Museum but if you love Porsches it certainly covers their achievements",
          "Every single Porsche was in display at this museum. I think more interactive or \"different\" activities could be placed.",
          "What an incredible museum for car lovers and the like. Open and airy, this museum has quite an incredible display of automobiles..",
          "I am not a car enthusiast, went because my husband and son wanted to go. The cars themselves were of little interest, but even i appreciated that for basically one type of car the displays and varieties were excellent. Compared to Mercedes a few days before Porsche was bright,",
          "Excellent value for money and on Le Mans weekend amazing value and a great half day !!! Why make me write more... how annoying....",
          "Beautiful museum, we wanted to see the factory but closed for summer. Highly recommend the museum . Lots of history",
          "Went with my wife and her family. Spent a few hours there and if you go here first and then the Mercedes, you'll save a little more because both offer a 10% discount with a ticket from the other and Mercedes is a little more expensive. Porsche had a number of beautiful and",
          "Fantastic museum with just the right blend of cars, history, engineering and racing. The building has a modern and striking design and the cars were beautifully lit ad presented. We used the audio guide, but actually there were alot of information on signs in both german and",
          "A must stop to see the and understand the history and pedigree of the Porsche brand. Way laid out to take you through the history and loved the engine simulator. Will look to do the factory tour next time when hopefully we will have more time",
          "Interesting and good value for Porsche fans and those interested in cars. Located in a stunning building and well laid out with free audio guides included in the \u20ac8 entrance fee. Takes about 1 hour to walk around. Lots of extra things to entertain children too. Easy to reach",
          "Beautiful building , cars, displays, layout . Everything is done to perfection. The workshop down stairs is cleaner than our kitchen at home !! The only thing is the gift shop - lower the prices and you would sell out easily. I dont know why paces like this (and it does seem",

          "We had a great beginning and rented a Carrera 911 for a day. Pick up was very professional. Driving the car was an amazing experience. However 11 am the next day the oil warming went on and we were asked to return to the garage. We returned it an hour early after not being able",
          "Being a car lover, and really liking Porsche, although I'll possibly never have one, I wanted to see the Museum. We visited after the Mercedes one, and couldn't help but compare. It's unfair to say Porsche is a one trick pony, but a 911 with a turbo and without a turbo and one",
          "This is a brilliant car museum, logically laid out and with a free audio guide, offered in several languages. The museum tells the story of the development of the Porsche motor car and more. The Porsche brand even includes tractors! There are lots of cars to see and the",
          "Ok: So I know that most super cars are Italian... but I'm a Porsche fan, and I consider that Porsche cars are not just hundreds of HP on four wheels, but a sophisticated machinery, made under German specs and design - that's why I definitely enjoyed strolling around the many",
          "Smaller than Mercedes museum - less to view but cleaner viewing. Definately Destination for car lovers",
          "The museum is located in the center of Stuttgart city can easily get access with DE Bahn (train). It was my first time to travel to Stuttgart for work, thus I was so excited visiting the city and one of my colleague recommended me to go here. It was such a fun trip to the",
          "Actually, I didn't expect the visit to Porsche Museum would be so enjoyable. I am not a museum person while travelling, as I go for more natural trials. I took my 7-year old nephew who goes crazy for cars, to Porsche place, and found the place amazing and super-comfortable to",
          "If you're interested in cars then this is the place for you. This is a great day out and the museum is covered in pristine Porsche cars from over the years. I'd recommend this to anyone visiting Stuttgart.",
          "A very nice museum with a fair number of cars but there is a lack of a clear structure as it is basically cars in a large room. Might have been better with the audio guide. It's a nice touch though that you can sit in a few of the cars and the location next to the train station",
          "I had been looking forward to visiting the museum for some time. I don't own a Porsche, but after touring the museum and factory, there might be one in my future. Porsche has done it in fine style. The building is an architectural marvel. Schedule a factory tour then tour the",

          "You can see the evolution of the Porsche cars through the years with displays of each car. You won't see any other brands which is great or monotonous depending on the type of fan you are of the brand.",

          "Super nice places near to Mercedes museum.",

          "If you love Porsche this museum is a must see.  Lots of interesting tidbits and we really enjoyed the flow of the place by how the exhibits were set up.  Nice gift shop, and there is even a little cafe for a snack or even a beer.  Our only complaint was that it was sooooo hot inside.  Wear layers just in case!",
          "Porsche Museum is the best place to visit in Stuttgart! Not only for car lovers, but for the others who would like to see something different. Everything is perfect inside (and outside)",
          "Smaller than I expected, but still very nice to visit if you're a car fan. Information next to the cars is very extensive and the whole museum is gorgeously designed (expected from a brand as Porsche of course). It is very spacious and \u2026",
          "Really nice museum, but if your kids are very young then it might be difficult for you to go through the audio books and understand the entire journey of Porsche as a company. \nI liked the test of the accelerator peddle and the acoustics \u2026",

Half price entry if you show your valid train ticket. Good place to eat too - a choice of restaurants. Easy to get to from Stuttgart train station.",

          "Must visit when you in Stuttgart, it\u2019s not that huge , but it\u2019s interesting with all Porsche cars from 100 years , when you can enjoy the history of this legend car , after 5 pm the entry will be 50 discounted which is 5 euro instead of 10 euro , also it is 2 minute walk from metro station",
          "If you like Porsches you must come to visit.... I personally would add more interactive features and a shop that sell one of a kind parts (race tyers, broken spoilers, broken engines, bumpers, etc...) and special parts (carbon fiber parts, race seats, etc...).",
          "I felt scorned. The exhibition is awesome, but expected much better service from a brand like Porsche. Nearby there is a good Italian called Franca e Franco which I really recommend!",

          "Clearly one of the best Car museum's I visited. You expect a lot and you get it. Also quite children friendly.",
          "The smallest museum of German automotive companies. After a while you see 911 or 911 and yet another 911. If you have not so much time to spend then  worth visiting. Otherwise Mercedes-Benz museum is better in my opinion.",
          "I enjoyed this museum but it didn\u2019t help that I went here literally right after visiting the Mercedes Benz museum on the other side of town. Maybe take this review with a grain of salt because of this. I\u2019m any event, it\u2019s much smaller and \u2026",
          "Cool place to see the history of Porsche. It costs about 8 euro to get in. You get a small phone and eat piece that allows you to have a computer guided tour through the museum. There are cars from historic races, as well as iconic cars from Porsche\u2019s history.",
          "Not as big or as informative as BMW or Benz museums. Staff are rude and rushing.\nHowever, there is a beautiful selection of iconic race cars and road cars all the way to 2010s.",
          "Good price. 8\u20ac p.p. or 4\u20ac for students. If you get the Audioguide it'll probably take you a solid 1.5h but if you just want to see the cars you'll be done in half an hour.",
          "Smaller than the Mercedes-Benz Museum but more interactive displays that you can actually play with can be found.  Interior of the museum was nicely designed.  You will probably learn what matters to a Porsche design after visiting the museum.",

          "More than 80 automobiles and 200 exhibits chronicle Porsche\u2019s car-making history. Sections of the museum are devoted to Porsche standards, such as speed, capability and dependability. From late-May to mid-July, join Porsche in commemorating \u2026",

          "Amazing array of cars, very affordable price, and great design of the museum",
          "Not as good as Mercedes but still an excellent experience and great value. What I liked most about mercedes was the story flow from the beginning to now and beyond....Porsche was more sporadic in its story jumping around between periods. \u2026",

          "Great museum to learn about the Porsche company, the founders and the brand. A few rare Porsches.

The parking lot is very convenient, and has a lot of nice new Porsche in it as well.",
          "Let's start with the nice architecture of the building, continue with the very nice exhibits in which you can be very close (at the most of them at least) even to get inside for a picture ( there were 3 models for that purpose).

          "Reasonable priced Museum with all the important Porsche cars of each era.",
          "I loved every minute of it. It is a little confusing at first, because you do not know where to go and what you want to see, but if you follow the years you will see everything. I loved the fact that you can get so close to any of the cars. My biggest regret is that the 1 millionth Porsche 911 will never see the road.",
          "The Porsche Museum is an experience worthy of the marque it serves. Here you'll see the full history of Porsche, from the 356s of a little unknown company, 911s that put them on the map, and the racing cars that made the brand iconic. It's \u2026",

          "Great experience and well worth a visit. Smaller than Mercedes museum but more physical cars to see. Focus on the racing history and story of Porsche.

          "Great museum you must visit while in Stuttgart. History of Porsche the founder father and son, and all his great racing cars from the beginning of the century. Restaurant and coffee shop are great and prices good.",

          "Great place - one of the best museums I've been so far. Much better than Ferrari museum in Modena which is like silly kindergarten compared to university. Wish there were more information about each car, history and technical data but still - this is the benchmark",
          "This is a fairly small museum that would be best enjoyed by fans of Porsche. There is a fair bit of boasting and bragging about the brand in the exhibits and not much to keep the regular person entertained.",
          "The Porsche museum surpassed all expectations.  The contributions of Ferdinand Porsche and his company were presented in such a respectful and deeply impressive way.  The opportunity to see these vehicles and to honor the racing and innovation pedigree of Porsche are worth the price of admission many times over.",
          "It is really impressive, it is very worth visiting",
          "Unique museum but I wish they offered more information about the business side of the company and its' history. 95% of the material is about the mechanics of the car so unless that is your passion, it might get boring quick. It also often \u2026",

          "Amazing museum filled with the greatest creations from all time.\nThe building is very modern and really clean like you would expect in germany. \nThey have a big parking garage with a lot of space. The entrance & parking tickets are actually \u2026",
          "The Porsche museum is definitely one of my favorite attractions to visit when I am in Stuttgart! The place is amazing and the cars shown are rotated every few months, I always buy the combo ticket to visit the Mercedes Benz museum as well. It\u2019s worth the visit for all car enthusiasts.",

          "It is a lovely place specially if you love cars! The car simulation was pretty amazing too, you would actually tast the feeling of riding a Porsche. You would also learn a lot about Porsche's history, it is sich a refreshing experience.",

          "My son and I spent four hours bliss. And when I tell my is 12 years old, you should understand that four hours of joint interest is the definition of bliss. Porsche are very clever they have three cars available (Panamera, 911 Cab and GT3 \u2026",
          "This place was super cool even if you're not a car enthusiast",
          "Driving experiences can be acquired here, at the Museum. Hours and hours of exploration of the history of the Porsche marque, the racing pedigree, the automotive passion for excellence, and every model, every evolution, and every ounce of engineering and design can be extracted from this place and this experience.",
          "Interesting museum. Modern building. You can take a close look to cars and everything related to them. There is loads of information given about each model, you can buy audio guide and listen to each vehicle story, after that you can pleasure yourself in the restaurant in the first floor.",

          "A great place to visit for every motor enthusiasts.",
          "What a great place to learn about history of Porsche. So many dream cars from the past! There is a student ticket price for all you students, 4 euro if am not mistaken just show your uni ID-pass. It was a nice 2 hour journey loved it and took so many pictures of cars , some of them are art.",

          "Great for a quick visit! You could stay for a long time if you did all the audio points and displays. The audio guide was interesting for a few quick facts and stories.",
          "Feels like a big, shiny advert of Porsche. And that's a bit dissapointing. \nDon't get me wrong- the exhibition itself it's quite wide and informing, but at every step you feel like you are being convinced, that this is THE MOST powerful \u2026",
          "Very entertaining and interesting experience, time flies quickly when you're there!\nMost cars are not to be touched which is understandable but there is a platform where you can get in some of the new models and geta feel of the interior.\nThere is also a simulation driving game that can be played.",
          "good brief description of Porsche's museum",
          "Amazing display...find Tilman for a personal tour.",
          "Porschephiles beware....you will be here for hours.  Make sure you pre-schedule a factory tour while you are there.",

          "Well worth a visit if you're in the Stuttgart area, or driving past Stuttgart (as I was) as it's quite on the outskirts of the city.

          "Simply Porsch-the best of the best",
          "Great, beautiful cars well worth the visit, disappointment at not having 928s or 928s4  only 2 in the whole place then over coffee downstairs we spied one 928 in the garage, mainly shows racing cars.",
          "Absolutely lovely time here. Lots of cool history, the guided tour is nice and the lanyard as a gift is a nice touch. My only feedback would be to move the 959 and GT1 to more accessible spots for better viewing. The museum shop is also a tad cheaper xompared to the Mercedes museum. Magnet at Mercedes was 7\u00a3 vs 2\u00a3 at Porsche",
          "Place deserved for any recommendation!",
          "This place was super clean, fun and informative. Plan to spend the entire afternoon to get through the museum.",

          "Good museum. Ate in the restaurant beforehand where the food was excellent! Lots of cars to look around. I've given 4 stars only because I think the Mercedes museum is better as it explains the history more clearly. I still recommend the Porsche museum though",

Unfortunately I was not able to take the factory tour, that would have been a great experience.",

        "wiki": "Schlossplatz is the largest square in Stuttgart Mitte and home to the Neues Schloss which was built between 1746 and 1807. From its construction until the mid-1800s it was used as a military parade ground and not open to general public use. It stands next to two other popular squares in Stuttgart: Karlsplatz to the south and Schillerplatz to the south west. The K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe (King Street) bisects the plaza from north to south.\nThe Neues Schloss Palace and grounds have been public property since 1918.Along with much of Stuttgart Mitte, Neues Schloss was heavily damaged during the Allied Bombing of World War II and the building was restored from 1958-1964 with a modernized interior that houses the ministries of Culture and the Treasury for the government of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.Until the 1960s the King Street that bisects the plaza carried auto and truck traffic. Since that time the Stuttgart underground has built an underground station and tunnels were built to redirect traffic away from the plaza and K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe.The entire square was last fully renovated in 1977 to mark the staging of the Bundesgartenschau (State Garden Show) in Stuttgart. The lawns and flowerbeds were renewed in 2006 following the staging of the 2006 World Cup Finals.\n\n\n== Public transport ==\nSchlossplatz lies almost directly on the B27 road.\nBus routes 42 and 44, all 17 night buses, the U5, U6, U7, U12 and U15 lines of the Stuttgart underground stop directly on Schlossplatz.\n\n\n== Events ==\nEvery year Schlossplatz is home to major outdoor events such as open-air concerts, children's fairs and parts of the Weihnachten market including an outdoor ice rink. During the 2006 World Cup Finals the square regularly held more than 40,000 spectators who watched live matches on 3 huge screens.\nSchlossplatz featured the United Buddy Bears exhibition in summer 2008 - an array of 144 two metre-high sculptures, each designed by a different artist, touring the world as a symbol of cultural understanding, tolerance and mutual trust.\n\n\n== Other images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSchlossplatz panorama \u2013 Interactive 360\u00b0 Panorama\n[1] Stuttgart Tourism website page on the Neues Schloss\n[2] Stuttgart Tourism website page on the Schlossplatz.",

        "wiki": "For the Templer settlement, see Wilhelma, PalestineWilhelma  is a zoological-botanical garden in Stuttgart in the Bad Cannstatt district in the north of the city on the grounds of a historic castle. Wilhelma Zoo is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, seeing more than 2 million visitors annually.The Zoo and Botanical Garden have been staffed since 1846. The Moorish Revival style echoing the Alhambra have been maintained and supplemented since 1960. Today, the zoo has an area of about 30 hectares (0.30 km2), houses around 11,500 animals from around the world composed of roughly 1,200 species and roughly 6000 plants from all climates. Of Germany's zoos, Wilhelma's collection ranks second to the Berlin Zoological Garden. In addition to the public garden, Wilhelma also has a branch office located in Fellbach, where the zoo keeps its stallions.Wilhelma receives gorilla juveniles rejected by their mother and reared by the zookeepers. At age 2-3, the gorillas are sent back to their original zoo(s).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Modern Wilhelma ===\n\nIn 1829, the property the zoo stood near the mineral springs on the Castle Rosenstein estate. Then Duke William I of W\u00fcrttemberg decided to build a royal bathhouse in the gardens. The Duke decided that the bathhouse should be built in the Moorish style in the same fashion as the Alhambra in the Spanish province of Granada, with an attached Orangery. Unfortunately, construction ground to a halt in 1816 due to economic woes caused by the Year Without Summer, so Wilhelma became just another summer residence of the Dukes and later Kings of W\u00fcrttemberg. Ludwig von Zanth was hired in 1837 to design and construct the Duke's bathhouse.\n1842 saw the completion of the first few buildings of the Duke's bathhouse and the site received the name Wilhelma. The imaginative von Zanth knew how to fire up the Duke's mind and thus was able to complete the Duke's summer villa, which consisted of a residential building, a domed hall and two neighboring greenhouses, each with a corner pavilion. In 1846, the marriage between Charles I of W\u00fcrttemberg and Olga Nikolaevna of Russia was celebrated at Wilhelma, which by now had a banquet hall, two main building with several courtrooms, several gazebos, greenhouses and a large park. The cottage would be finished 20 years later.\n\n\n=== Beginning of Modern Wilhelma ===\nThe abdication of King in 1918 saw Wilhelma pass into the possession of the city of Stuttgart and state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. To this day it has been maintained by the Ministry of Finances. Wilhelma was opened to the public in 1919 as a botanical garden. A significant part of the zoo's income was the orchid collection, which brought in money by selling offspring from the garden (a practice at that time unique in Germany). The Imperial Garden Show of 1939 took place in Stuttgart at Wilhelma.Wilhelma was badly damaged during World War Two Allied bombing raids during the night of October 19 and 20, 1944. The Garden and Orangery suffered extensive damage; the plants that had not been moved prior to prevent their destruction were either destroyed or heavily damaged. The then director of the gardens, Albert Sch\u00f6chle wanted to restore the gardens but also had an idea to once again incorporate animals on the property.\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\n1949 saw the reopening ceremony that featured an aquarium. In 1950 a bird exhibit featuring cassowaries, a pheasant, rheas, ostriches, and birds of paradise was unveiled at Wilhelma. This exhibition was followed by the \"Animals of the German Fairy Tale\" in the same year. It featured such animals as brown bears, lions, various snakes including anacondas and pythons, and dinosaurs, giant turtles, and crocodiles. Another exhibit, \"Animals of the Plains of Africa,\" once again featured lions, crocodiles, antelopes, waterbucks, zebras, wildebeests, and giraffes. The \"Indian Jungle Exhibit\" was the most successful exhibit in the entire history of Wilhelma. The display included elephants, tigers, leopards, Asiatic black bears, and Macaques. Even though the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's Ministry of Finances ordered the animals from those exhibits removed, the order was never carried out. 1965 saw the founding of the Association of Friends and Supporters of Wilhelma.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\n1960 was a good year for Wilhelma; the Stuttgart Council of Ministers approved expansions of the zoo, and this was approved by the Landtag of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg 1961. New additions to the zoo included the renovation of King Wilhelm's Moorish villa into the exhibit for nocturnal animals in 1962, the construction of a new modern building and an aquarium in 1967, and buildings and exhibits for big cats, rhinos, and hippos in 1968. Then director Albert Sch\u00f6chle retired in 1970 and was replaced by Wilbert Neugebauer. Under Neugebauer, a building for the zoo's monkeys completed in 1973, South American plants in 1977, hoofed African animals in 1982, Sub Tropics exhibit in 1981, and Youngstock House in 1982. Biologist Dieter Jauch became the third director in 1989, previously working as the curator of the aquarium. In Jauch's tenure, the previous system for bears and climbing animals was revised in 1991, the zoo's demonstration farm was completed in 1993, and a new aviary for the zoo's penguins and kangaroo enclosure were completed in the same year. Wilhelma's Amazon House was finished in 2000, the insectarium in 2001, the Bongo exhibit was expanded in 2003, Crocodile Hall was renovated in 2006, the Elephant enclosure was renovated in 2012, the meerkat hall was finished in 2013, and the African Apes Hall was opened that same year. Further work by Jauch included a new outdoor terrarium and the expansion of the bison enclosure in 2013. Thomas K\u00f6lpin became director in 2014. His tenure saw the conclusion of the renovation of the old palace into the nocturnal animals hall (1962\u20132014) with the aim to build an entirely new building for the zoo's nocturnal animals in Elephant Park, and the finishing of the small animals house (1968\u20132014).\n\n\n=== Current use ===\nBy 1993, Wilhelma reached its current size. A new ape house was opened in May 2013 (construction cost 22 million euros). The redesigned exterior of the elephant enclosure was completed in April 2012. To make room for even more elephants, the rhinos will be moving to their previous enclosure. A new hippo plant on the Neckar with a new pedestrian crossing is in development. A collaboration with the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n and the National Museum of Natural History on this topic is being discussed. Construction will connect Wilhelma to Stuttgart 21 and B10 tunnel; Wilhelma will serve as a railroad stop on the B10 route. Construction is to begin in September 2015. Another 20 year bill granting funds for further expansion to Wilhelma was put up for consideration by the Ministry of Finances was approved July 2015.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\n\n=== Pachyderms ===\nThe Elephant and Rhino houses were completed in 1968, and ropes were later installed in 1990 to replace the chains. The grounds of both buildings were redesigned in 2012 to include trees and an animal friendly scrub basin, increasing its total size to 830 square metres (8,900 sq ft). In addition, a clay wallows and two basins with interchangeable substrates (e.g. bark mulch, gravel.) were added. Currently, there are two living elephants at Wilhelma: Pama (1966) and Vella (1967). Previous elephants include Vilja, the oldest living elephant in Europe, died July 10, 2010 (cause of death is thought to be circulatory collapse), and Molly, whom was euthanized in July 2011 at the age of about 45 years. Other elephants at the zoo include the African elephant Jumbo and, briefly, an Asian bull elephant sent by the Indian state as a gift to Stuttgart. Another construction project, announced in a speech, that will begin in 2020 is in the planning stages.Wilhelma's rhinos, housed in the same building as the elephants, include:Bruno, the bull, who was raised in Cologne, and until 2019 Sani who was given to Stuttgart by the Nepalese state as a gift in 1993. Together, they made up the current breeding pair. Before them, Wilhelma's Rhino breeding pair were Nanda and Puri.\nThe Tapir House, built in the Expansion era in 1968, housed the pygmy hippo bull, Hannibal, the hippos Rosi and Maikand some warthogs. The building houses today malayan tapirs and  babirusas. \n\n\n=== Ungulates ===\nThe plant complex for African ungulates which includes the giraffe house, was opened 1980th Today there live zebras, giraffes, kudus, okapi, Dorcas gazelle, Marabou stork and Somali wild ass. Wilhelma has been very successful in the breeding of  giraffes, Somali wild asses, bongos, okapi, bontebok and zebras. Since 1989, a total of 12 okapi have arrived at Wilhelma. In the giraffe house there are not only the indoor enclosure of giraffe and okapi, but also the home of Congo peacocks, Fennec foxes, short-eared elephant shrews and weaver birds. Former residents include Grant's zebras, shoebills, porcupines, klipspringers, waterbucks, warthogs and numerous antelopes.The \"Ranch\" that borders the Tapir House, new Ape House, and excavation site of the tunnel to Castle Rosenstein, was built as a temporary holding area in the 1980s. It houses takins and the zoo's bison, and an onager.\n\n\n=== Primates ===\n\nThe old Ape House, opened in 1973, was one of the most modern of its kind at the time. The building's design, since copied by numerous other zoos and again mimicked in the new ape house, was characterized by features like the carousel-style design of the enclosure and the tiles that line them and the specialized support disks that allowed increased force distribution. The last two chimpanzees at Wilhelma were acquired in the summer of 2010 due to European Endangered Species Programme drive begun at Veszpr\u00e9m. Since the opening of the new ape house, the old house has been used exclusively for the zoo's orangutans. In 2011, it was announced that the zoo wished to remodel the enclosures of the orangutans, lutungs and gibbons.\nWhen the old ape house (built in 1973) no longer met international standards, Wilhelma had to build a new ape house. In Spring of 2010, the project began to not only meet international standards, but to also include housing for gorillas and bonobos in an outdoor area. The new building, 13 times the size of the original structure at 4,500 square metres (48,000 sq ft), was opened to the public on May 14, 2013. Construction of the New Ape House wound up costing the zoo about 22 million euros, 70% more than the original 9.5 million euros financed towards the project. The unfortunate deaths of two bonobos thanks to malfunctioning components in the ventilation system have called the construction quality of the building into question.The Monkey facility, opened in 1973, now houses both gibbons and lutungs. Here, Wilhelma's breeding program for the Slim monkey is remarkable among other zoos in the world at 37 new pups. 2015 saw some remodeling done to the gibbons enclosure for visitor convenience. The building has housed Proboscis monkeys, Lion-tailed macaques, Drills, Doucs, and Spider and Capuchin monkeys.\nSince 1975, two other structures for (originally) housing primates were reconstructed. The larger of the two now houses Geladas, hyraxes, and Barbary sheep. The other still houses Japanese macaques.\n\n\n=== Birds ===\nThe first major expansion to Wilhelma's collection of birds began with the Sub Tropics Aviary in 1981 that houses kookaburras, Marbled ducks, Northern bald ibises, numerous species of parrot. A special feature of the aviaries is the only New Zealand kaka outside of New Zealand and the first successful breeding of a Kea in Germany. Due to the strain put on the historic wall of the Sub Tropic Aviary by the New Ape House, a new project for a larger aviary is pending.\nThere are several aviaries behind Damascene Hall that were once used for Pheasantry when Wilhelma was still a palace for the King of W\u00fcrttemberg. In the post war period, these were used for housing small predatory animals including Canines, small cats, and civets. Since the restoration of the aviaries in the 1990s, they now hold native birds such as partridges, Eurasian bullfinchs, sparrows, and various pigeon species. In 2015, a modification was made to these aviaries to house capercaillies for Wilhelma's in situ participation of Species protection in the Black Forest region.For the 1993 World Horticultural Exposition, a new enclosure for African penguins (who had been at Wilhelma since 1953) to replace their old habitat in the Garden's ponds near the Moorish villa adjacent to the bird aviary. There also were located Humboldt, Rockhopper, Gentoo, and King penguins. Public feedings occur daily.\nIn 1993, an aviary for birds from all over the world was constructed. Included are Black storks, ibises, Great hornbills, and an Asian and Australian community aviary that contains a Microbat exhibit and feeding kitchen.Wilhelma's collection of cranes began with a bird exhibition in 1950: Redcrowned, Blue, and White-naped cranes and also a Hawaiian goose joined Wilhelma. Birds that used to have a presence at the zoo include other types of cranes, shoebills, geese, and curiously a Brush kangaroo.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe aquarium staff was responsible for inadvertently breeding a strain of Caulerpa taxifolia or \"Killer Algae,\" a highly invasive species of algae which has had \"severe negative consequences for biodiversity\".\nWilhelma Zoo is Europe's only large combined zoological and botanical garden.\nThe upper section of the zoo includes an impressive stand of sequoia trees.\nThe botanical gardens contain Europe's biggest magnolia grove.\nWilhelma adjoins a public park to its west laid out in the 'English landscape style' of rolling grass and informal groups of trees; this perfectly complements the landscape of the zoo.\nWilhelma has a branch department in Fellbach where it keeps Stallions.\nWilhelma is the only state owned zoo in Germany.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of botanical gardens in Germany\n\n\n== References ==\nWarning: Most of these notes are in German.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWilhelma on zooinstitutes.com",

          "We went to visit the zoo with our 4 year olds. All the signs and maps are in German which makes it slightly tourist unfriendly. When we got to a tiger lying on a steel shelf in a white tiled cage we turned around and left. Coming from Africa I just found it far to cruel",

          "I'm not sure what I expected. The grounds are lovely but the poor animals have hardly any room at all. I was quite thankful a lot of animal houses appeared to be empty and so not locked in a cage so small it was awful. Where there were animals they looked so bored. Best",
          "City centre zoos have a reputation for being small, cramped and under-invested. Wilhelma was a pleasant surprise with a wide selection of well-cared for animals in an enormous parkland setting. All seemed happy in their environs, and there is clearly a great deal of ongoing",

          "Built many years ago the way zoos were built it is extremely popular with children. The botanical garden is part of the complex and is my favorite on a sunny spring or fall day. Both can be seen in half a day",
          "To start, let me just say to plan on making this a full day trip, because there is a lot to see there. Near the ticket counter, there is a map that you can grab of the zoo that shows you where all of the exhibits are located, and the route that the zoo suggests for you to take",
          "Wilhelma is a zoological and botanical garden in one. There are green houses with cactuses, tropical vegetation and technical plants of exotic regions. Animals are kept in precisely designed plots with their natural vegetation. All premises contains detailed description for",

          "Visited the zoo in December 2015 during our stay in Stuttgart entry fee is cheap for the size of the zoo. Had a wide variety of animals and a lovely garden area to walk through.",
          "Many to see, not too crawded, family friendly zoo. Good design of round trip, just follow the map and you will not anything, relax day!",
          "Great day out, lots to see in the zoo and the gardens are really pretty to walk round. Lots of places to stop for drinks, most of which serve beer!! Good price to get in and easy to get to by train!",
          "Great for an afternoon, so much to see and very well maintained. We just arrived in Stuttgart from an international flight. This was a perfect thing to do to adjust into vacation. Very clean, lots to see, nice stroll threw the botanical gardens is a good way to relax!",
          "Really big zoo, the biggest I have ever seen! Animals seem to be very well treated and happy, which makes me like it even more. Recommended!",
          "Who does not like a zoo. This is the main one in the city and it is fun.. Good for kids and grownups. All the animals are here and people too. So enjoy it on a rainy day and the crowds will be less.",
          "One of the best Zoos I've ever visited. It was a family trip with our 5 year old son and three of us enjoyed the day at the fullest. It's a huge area and we wlked the whole day. They have restaurants at three different corners and food quality is really good. Food were not pricy",
          "This zoo is just huge! You have to walk through a really big park to visit all the animals, aquarium, snakes etc. I like that there is so much free space, not only for the visitors but also for the animals. I recommend visiting the zoo early autumn or late spring, in winter it's",
          "Of all the zoos I have visited this is by far the worst. Admittedly the gardens and the surroundings are beautiful, however the animals enclosures are unbelievably small. Especially with regards to the leopards, the cages were tiny and they had no room to move/swim. The",
          "It has many animals like all zoos but they have used the existing palace and gardens giving this zoo tremendous charm and character. Wonderful way to spend a day. Only downside is that it goes rather straight so if you are seeing everything in one day, after you reach then you",
          "The Botanical Garden is truly beautiful and the zoo is a good size. Just very sad to see the condition of the animals cages. The leopard and tiger enclosures are tiny",
          "Lovely zoo great day out with family very relaxing not just a day out its a fun day out lots of activities for children.",
          "Even though I saw many Zoos around the world I highly recommend this one. The reasons are: whether or not you are interest in animals, it is just a lovely place to walk around. The focus is on many species which are threatened with extinction. Last but not least it is also a",
          "I've been visiting this zoo for close to thirty years now, and each time I am impressed. The variety of animals, gardens, greenhouses and landscaping is simply awesome. I am usually unimpressed by aquariums, but the one at Wilhelma just fantastic. On top of this, the, the",

          "My boyfriend and I had a great time at Wilhelma, it is a great place to walk, go through the botanical garden which holds plants from different parts of the world and visit the animals. For us, the best part was the polar bear!! When you get there you can check on the plan",
          "one of the most beautiful Zoo's. Best time when no school vacation or weekends. Beautiful old greenhouses with great atmosphere and exotic birds. Located in an old castle area. During spring time fantastic magnolia blooming trees.",
          "Visited here on our trip to Stuttgart and it was a lovely day out. Very good prices. Think it works out around \u00a311 per person which is very good value for money! It would be ideal for a full day out with a picnic as there's loads of grass areas to sit down and chill. There's",

          "We absolutely fell head over heels in love with this beautiful place! Though at times a bit challenging to navigate with a stroller, the stunning gardens prompted a few toe tickling games of 'where's the baby', and gelato assisted rests. The seal show was loads of fun just as",

          "Visited here with family and had a great time - so much to see and really enjoyed the fact the place was also a botanical garden. The zoo/gardens are very well maintained and clean. Lots of great indoor and outdoor exhibits which were nice as it did rain while we were there.",
          "Space reserved for some big animals like Hippo, elephants are ridiculous. Instead of having a great day outside, turns out to be miserable due to animal conditions. I will never come back. I really hope they renovate the park and give better structure to them. I was shocked to",
          "Nice zoo.. many different animals, good to go if have children or even if you do not have. Good location, easy to go, the trail leaves you next to the zoo. There is a park very nice beside the zoo, you can run, ride a bike or just walk. You can expend all the day in both places.",
          "Nice garden and animals in the down town. Great for relax and all day trip. Parking inside a area. Atc.",
          "A really nice stop in Stuttgart if you want to get further out of the city. The zoo is okay, as like most zoo's the size of the animal enclosures are questionable but otherwise we had a nice experience there. You can't access the zoo or gardens separately - it's an all in 1",
          "Great zoo with beautiful gardens and lots of animals. Easily accessible from public transportation. Best in the early spring when the flowers are blooming.",
          "This zoo is terrific. Actually it's much more than a zoo. The botanical garden is impressive as well.",
          "We took two kids (ages 8 and 10), to the zoo in Stuttgart on a Monday when our first option -- tours of the Porsche or Mercedes Museums -- got nixed due to them both being closed on Mondays. (It was a not our travel agent's finest hour!) At any rate, the zoo is terrific -- lots",

          "I did take few years to live in Stuttgart until i visited the zoo and i can only think why i didn't come earlier!! Zoo is larger than it looks outside, spacious, well maintaned, pretty and variety of animals impessive!! I really enjoyed my visit and will surely go again!!",
          "Lovely 19th? Century architecture. Glasshouses packed full of healthy exotic flora. I am not normally keen on zoos, but the animals we saw appeared content and in good condition. Wonderful displays.",

          "Spent am afternoon here. Highly recommended. We had no idea how vast this place was until after entering so would advise a full day to see it properly. Very reasonably priced and loads to see and do.",
          "We were here on a busy weekend day and found it a little overwhelming. The animals are in small enclosures, the catering is not wonderful and over busy (take a picnic). Tripsdrill only an hour away is a better place to see animals. It may be better when less busy but in our view",
          "very beautiful place.. you will need a lot of hours to see all the places .. another positive is that the place is very very clean...",
          "Be prepare to wear comfortable shoes coz you gonna walk a lot to see everything..very good for everyone specially for kids",
          "The zoo is nice. Especially the plant houses are really pretty with a relaxing atmosphere. Some of the animal houses are to small and from the sixties, but overall also the animals are nice to see.",
          "Stuttgart's zoo is really pretty stunning. Beautiful botanical gardens and so many animals to see that it's honestly hard to do it all in one day. Wear comfortable shoes, as it is rather hilly. If you Google the zoo's website, you can see information in both English and German.",
          "We visited this zoo in September 2015. It was a nice place to visit - the gardens were particularly beautiful and there a wide range of animals to see. However, we felt that many of these animals were kept in poor conditions. The elephants in particular had a small enclosure for",
          "it was an amazing place, the variety of animals and birds was phenomenal. I thought the Elephants and Rhinos had space that looked too limited, but all the rest had excellent areas. It may be that the Elephants had enough space, but just my opinion. I spent far longer than",
          "We had a nice sunny day for our visit... With the gardens looking lovely. There were big crowds, but the place is big enough to cope. We found some of the animal enclosures terrible... Lots of concrete, small confined spaces and unhappy looking animals... The latter commented",
          "The zoo is highly accessible via the U14 from downtown central station (15min ride) or U13 from other locations. Alternatively, you could walk there from downtown via the Schlossgarten park (about 45 min). If it is a nice day and you feel like enjoying your day walking, this is",
          "Very easy to get to on U14 line from Stuttgart. It was dull and wet when I went but still a good visit with lots to see. Some exhibits are inside so I could get out of the rain. They provide a map with a walking tour that covers the main sites. This has numbered waypoints, but",
          "As world travelers this zoo was just ok. The grounds are nice and clean and the area is spacious. For a zoo in a big city, I thought the animals were limited. I would not make this a point to visit when in Stuttgart.",
          "A nicely laid out zoo and botanical gardens in one complex. Just a short U Bahn ride from the city centre a lovely place to spend a few hours. Apart from the usual zoo animals there are beautifully laid out gardens and greenhouses.",
          "If you wanna go not just to a zoo but also a beautiful garden and park - this is the place. You can find there some rarely animals like the okapi (a giraffe with short-necked giraffe) or a great house only for the apes. You can find also huge and different park areas with",
          "This place is really worth the money. Tickets are relatively inexpensive and it will take you all day to explore.",

          "I went with my child one Sunday morning. It is not a good day to visit a zoo but we had fun and we saw something interresing",
          "This is a very good zoo. They have most of the animals ranging from polar bear to bangal tiger, to one horn rhino. Also, there is one small amazon valley, in which they try to create environment similar to amazon jungle.",
          "It is somewhen in the back, upper part - from where you go to the big animals. But you will hear it throughout the whole part. And the park, btw, is made in mauritanian style, which I find really beautiful mixed with art nouveau. Go there in a sunny day, you will not be",

          "This place is great. You can see the beauty of nature all around the world. The animals are well cared and the staff is great. You have to take a day off to see the entire zoo. It is the best zoo I've ever seen.",
          "The Wilhelma is one of the top zoos and botanical gardens in Europe! In the green houses, birds and tropical plants are integrated. In the Amazonian house birds, bats and the Iguana roam and fly free while the monkeys, anaconda, caiman have their own area. In the newest",
          "Great place to test cameras and catch great animals :-) It is a rather large area so take some time with you. Really impressive is the Buttlerfly House",
          "Always worth visiting! For families I recomend using the \"upper\" entrance that leads directly to the farm/kids zoo (and the nearby new primate area - although I would rather like to have safe places for them in nature than in the zoo). One will also pass Milka-Pyramide where",
          "I saw another review complain about the 11 euro admission fee, so I was a little worried about going. I didn't need to be. It's a lovely place and probably worth twice the admission fee. More than enough animals, and you do get very close to a number of them. It's very easy to",
          "The zoo is easy to get to and has a excellent variety of exotic animals. Its a great place for a nice easy Sunday afternoon to walk off lunch.",
          "I went there alone to spent the day and it was just amazing. Though it was a little colder that day it did not take away from the fun and the beauty of the place. The botanical gardens are just beautiful and having the Moorish revival style grounds just added to the experience.",

          "I visited Wilhelma with my three year old son in December 2015 whilst on holiday. We had a fantastic day. Wilhelma has so much to see, we were there for about five hours! It covers quite a vast area, so be prepared to walk lots. However, you wouldn't notice as there is",
          "Great zoo and gardens, very family oriented and space for buggies etc.. Germans know their stuff and bring it to perfection here, not only building cars or motorways but they need some help in the restaurant business, as the service was the pits!, that's why 4/5. Went for lunch",
          "It's an old zoo (I think it was built in the early 1900's) that has largely withstood the test of time. The landscape is beautiful, there are elegant old greenhouses and the exhibits are for the most part excellent. I am a particular fan of their aviaries, rainforest house,",

          "I had absolutely nothing to do on a rainy day in November, so I decided to visit the Wilhelma. It was a great day. You don't really have to spend a lot of time outside unless you want to. The greenhouses are wonderful, and so are the animals. A fair-priced restaurant is there",
          "We visited this zoo on Saturday as a group of three adults and two small kids, and we had a great day! It wasn't too busy considering it was a Saturday, and we got to see most of the animals. Some of the animal enclosures are a little dated- I don't agree with polar bears",
          "I grew up in the region and remember this as one of my favorite places from childhood; it is still worth going there, especially the greenhouses with wonderful plants and cactus conservatories; I can conjure up memories full of sounds and smells and wonderful birds",

          "This is a garden that was build by King Wilhelm as a copy of an english royal garden. Since then they have collected hundreds of plants and animals and made it a unique beutiful place to go especially during summertime. It is good for family singles and couples as everyone will",
          "A large zoo with many of the animals and creatures that you would see in a large zoo back in the USA. The botanical gardens are very nice and if your into plants and flowers, its a must see in Stuttgart. Within the city center of Stuttgart with parking and public trans access.",

          "I go to this zoo once or twice a year. My favorite is the butterfly room in spring - amazing for both kids and grownups alike! It's a great place for kids, with a petting zoo off to the side, and the new building for the apes and bonobos is beautiful, where you can often see the",

          "the park is reached easily by a short train ride from the main train station in stuttgart. it has the perfect combination of a botanical garden and a zoo. the landscape architect of this park deserves every possible award. if you are in stuttgart on a sunday morning, when most",
          "I have never seem such clean zoo. I don't know how they did that, but the places has many flowers and it doesn't smell like a regular zoo. Very nice place to visit, not only to see the animals, but also for the gardens. It really worth the visit. Just go!",
          "The Wilhelma Park combines a nice place to walk around and see lots of exotic animals in safe and realistic settings, seals, African elephants, giraffes, monkeys, reptiles and big cats. The combination of botanical gardens and plant displays in the same area is a good idea--the",

          "Have just returned from a trip to Stuttgart, and I've got to say, the zoo was the highlight of the trip. It was good value for money, it cost 16 euros, but we were there for 7 hours, and the food and drink prices were very reasonable. It outshines any UK I've ever been to,",
          "This zoo is huge! So much to see from plants to animals to fish to insects, and all of it's spectacular! The animals have so much room to move around, and the zoo is constantly expanding to make their inhabitants more comfortable. And, unlike many zoos I've been to we were able",
          "The territory of the zoo is not that big, but the number of different species is really huge. We spent the whole day there and I'm not sure we had a look at everything. Some plants and animals are pretty \"normal\", but there is also a lot of very unusual and amazing creatures!",

          "This is a very nice zoo but I think it is the botanical garden that makes it so special. Even during a late winter visit there is so much too see, and at this time of year, there aren't any crowds. The animals seemed happier than those at some zoos I've visited. By far my",
          "This is a great day out for all types of travellers. So many animals and such beautiful gardens, it's definitely worth a visit! If you're just with adults, I'd allow at least 3 hours to see it all comfortably (with kids probably longer- there's so much stuff for them to do!).",

          "The zoo is nicely laid out, although be prepared for a bit of a walk, as the exhibits twine up and around some rather steep hills. The antique buildings and gardens are breathtaking and very well kept up. The aquarium is also very nicely put together, and is right inside the",

          "This is a fantastic zoo but the gardens are even better. Wilhelma is a good way for a family to spend the day surrounded by beautifully maintained hedgerows and world-class animal exhibits. While there is food available in the park, feel free to bring your own lunch, snacks,",

          "The Zoo in Stuttgart is not heavily advertised, but in my opinion they do not get much better. The location is part of an old palace garden, with many of the old buildings, I always want to call it a menagerie because of this. The animals here seem much more active than some",
          "The Zoo has beautiful gardens, the animals are treated well, relatively big spaces (ok, not 10miles x 10miles for the tiger). I hate zoos, but this one was really amazing and enjoyable. The bird house is really interesting, you can walk inside, it is covered with nets.",

          "Every time we are in Stuttgart we visit. The beautiful gardens, the Farm. the Childrens play area including good value donkey rides",
          "Very varied species of animals and lots of play areas for the children. Food in the restaurants is of moderate quality",
          "The zoo was great and the botanical gardens were definitely interesting. However, we went on a day which wasn't particularly nice - a bit gloomy. Halfway through the zoo walk, it started raining and that sort of ended the fun. I'm not one for wandering around looking at animals",
          "It\u00b4s always nice to visti this zoo, the attractions are prepared nicely all the time, kept clear and fairly affordable entrance fees. Especailly in summer time you can enjoy the garden like layout, with relaxing areas.",
          "The zoo overall was great. Good location, nice setup - you could easily spend a whole day there with your kids. Unfortunately, we went on a very hot day and majority of the large animals were hiding so my kids didn\u00b4t get to see much. They should put some areas for the animals",
          "It's a lot of fun. It's hilly though, so bring your walking shoes. Not \"uniquely Stuttgart\", but a great zoo for sure.",
          "I am a bit of a lover of zoos - it's a great way to spend a morning or afternoon when on holidays and you get to see loads of interesting things. This zoo is the best I have been to - even better than Singapore. The bird displays were superb - being a bit of a birder - and",
          "This is one of the best zoos We have been to. The animals were active and the viewing areas were adequate. The gardens and greenhouses were the best part...absolutely beautiful. The only thing that could have made our visit better would have been a map! There were \"road",

          "If you are interested in plants and animals, and if you enjoy strolling through a nicely modelled park the Stuttgart zoo is worth a trip for you. We (in this case four adults and two small children) spent five hours there - and we do not regret a single moment. To see",
          "The children love going to the Wilhelma, so do we! It is a large zoo built on a slope with lots of space for the animals and visitors. There are monkeys, urangutans, elephants, leopards, etc. At the top of the zoo there is a more farm-like petting zoo where children can go",
          "Definitely not a international tourist attraction. Good for locals to have a nice walk or to spend sometime in the week end I have visited game reserve in Africa and hence the zoo doesn't impress. Landscaping shall be improved",
          "I very much enjoyed a day's visit to the zoo with my adult daughter. As expected, it was mostly young German families with children visiting on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The highlights to me were the monkeys, birds and fish. The monkeys were playful and the birds were",

          "We liked the botanical garden setting and the Moorish themed glasshouses and small buildings. There was plenty of places to sit for a rest or picnic. The zoo was well maintained and most pens were landscaped and reasonably roomy but some areas needed updating such as the bird",
          "It's a zoo combined with an emperor themed garden. Fact is, this zoo was built by an emperor in Stuttgart. It's a gorgeous place for an afternoon stroll and the animals are plenty to look at - especially the Pelican lake and the polar bear pool. This is a great day trip for",
          "This Zoo is a beautiful attraction. A family of four will cost you 30 euros. Parking for 5 hrs costs 5 euros and we were very close to the entrance. Please wear comfortable shoes, there's a lot to see. We first stop at this large botanical garden. Lots of flowers, trees, cactus,",
          "We have been to this zoo a number of times and never tire of it. Although it is not particularly large, it has plenty to keep young children entertained and I would say you can easily get around and see everything in a day. There are also quite a few indoor sections, which",

          "They have lots of animals. What else to say, hey hey hey?",

          "We love going to this zoo. I have two young children and a double stroller that we get around in. The zoo is very spacious, plenty of lawns for my 2 year old to run around on and for us to have a picnic whenever a break is needed. The animals are easy to see and the cages",
          "If you love plants fabulous. One lovely local or exotic plant after another. If you like animals mostly great e.g budgies have a covered garden area in which you can take a walk just a brilliant idea. Butterflies a huge glass house perfect. Quite newly build monkey island.",

          "After visiting several \"world-class\" zoos, I was not too eager to visit this one. I was wrong. This was a great way to spend the day and get some fresh air. The zoo is spread out in an amazing botanical garden. There are several things to make sure you do and/or see, from",

          "Weirdly enough I have been to 5 zoos in all my life. This one takes first place. I think its the design of the zoo that helps it stand out. Use what you have and display the animals in the most real way possible. without making it look like they are all just trapped in a cage.",
          "Visited in Mid November. It was only a 3 min walk from the Wilhelma s-bahn stop. It was 8 Euros each to get in and we spent the entire day strolling through the zoo and the gardens at our leisure. We stopped in for a bite at the zoo's greenhouse cafe. Can be enjoyed by couples",
          "Historical palace gardens make for a great Zoo. Fantastic place to take a walk and enjoy some of Stuttgart's history.",
          "Another reason to knock it down was the price. 12 euro per adult, 6 euro for kids. It's a decent sized zoo, very well layed-out. Quite a bit of hills but nothing unmanagable for the average person. Parking was in a garage across the street. Fixed price of 3,50 euro. I was",
          "We arrived at Wilhelma at about 11am and just managed to get around everything by closing time at 4pm. It is a great zoo, so open, you can see the animals very clearly, we spent ages at the merekat enclosure as they were being adorable and were climbing the trees so they were",

          "A lot to see, learn, and experience. Beautiful animals from across the globe. The variety of sections and micro ecosystems are well designed and attractive. One day is not enough. I will come there again, but maybe next time outside any school holiday period.",

          "Great Zoo! Perfect place for kids to know about wildlife. They also have special section for small kids. Parking might be issue as this place is very popular. Try to take train if it is possible. Animals are well taken care off. Lions are a really amazing view. Gorillas are also speciality.",
          "Great experience! I visited the Zoo twice, but I' ll do it again for sure. Stuning botanical offer and wildlife selection. Huge grass fields for sitting and resting,high  number  of playgrounds for children and enough check points for food and drinks! An excellent place for families with children",
          "Always worth it. I enjoy the botanical part more.  Because of winter many animals not seen and lots of construction.  Go very early before the kids arrive.  Very tranquil",

          "Great place to take the family.",
          "The zoo is big and has a nice collection of animals. It is one of the hottest attractions in Stuttgart.\n\nTipps: \n- The map on the boards is to up to date. I stead, use the map in the brochures next to the entrance. The are accurate and up \u2026",
          "A bit confused, stretched and empty. Few, hidden and far between animals, enormous hilly expanses to walk, low on amenities and navigation logic. But the zoo is, in fact, tacked on top of a botanic park, so there is not much sense to the zoo part.",
          "Great little zoo in Stuttgart, clean and easy to walk in. Good option to spend few hours in your trip. More so if you are with kids.",
          "So cool and beautiful",

It is better to visit on summer since some animals are taken away during winter time.",
          "November towards the rest of winter is definitely not the best time to visit the zoo. A lot of areas were under construction and a lot of animals didn't seem to be in their places. It was especially disappointing not being able to see the \u2026",
          "Lovet place to see the animals and for the little ones to have fun",
          "The garden is impressive overall but I was very dissapointed by the fact that in this eormous place, the second biggest zoo after Berlin Garden you can't find a single English translation of the description. Also the orientation signs are not very explicit and helpful.",
          "Great zoo, some of the animals were not able to be seen but this was in January. The Lions were the best, looked amazing and sounded even better when they ROARED!!!",
          "Best zoo I've been to. They should all be like this. Beautiful gardens as well if that rocks your boat.",
          "Unexpectedly good zoo. A lot of wonderful green houses with beautiful architecture. The only disappointment was when the ticket machine \"ate\" our money, we couldn't get neither return nor sufficient ticket value to get inside, staff \u2026",
          "Evening ticket is a farce: 15 euro, and you barely have 2 hours, before two thirds of the animals are inaccessible. Although the park closes at 8, all closed spaces already close between 6:30 and 7:00, with animals being locked inside.",
          "Wilhelma is a large, well laid out zoo with a wide selection of animals, interspersed with beautiful gardens. It's a great way to spend a day with kids during the summer vacation or the weekend. The directons and descriptions are in German \u2026",
          "This is such a unique and wonderful place to come visit. I recommend this place to people who just want to have a relaxing day and want to see all the wonderful animals this zoo provides. \n\nThe zoo is clean and the animals look well taken \u2026",

          "Great zoo, so many animals, lovely children playgrounds, but there are only few snacks canteens and just 1 restaurant i guess",
          "Go there only when the weather is nice. The maps were only in german so. Cheap parking. The animals are upstairs. The plants and aquarium are downstairs",

The ticket is maybe expensive at first sight, but as soon as you get in there you'll understand why this is the price - everything is perfectly maintained. There is also a great restaurant and cafeteria.",
          "If you are into history and around the neighborhood, make a stop at this palace. It has got a long history and how it was used during worold war. I still wonder if the fountain was originally designed in 17th century or was a later addition during 20th century. There plenty of lemon trees in the garden, curious why.",

Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F).

Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg.

The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium.

Ludwigsburg Palace in the nearby town of Ludwigsburg is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.\nAs a result of Stuttgart's long history of viticulture (Even today there are vineyards less than 500 m (1,640 ft) from the Main Station), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the \"St\u00e4ffele\") around the city, equivalent to approximately 20 km (12 mi) of steps. Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond. For example, Gaisburger Marsch is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart's Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.\n\nIn October 2009 the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced that the European Union was to officially recognise the pasta dish Maultaschen as a \"regional specialty\", thus marking its significance to the cultural heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.In 1993 Stuttgart hosted the International Garden Show in the suburb of Killesberg. In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the Football World Cup. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.

It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy W\u00fcrttemberg until 1806, the W\u00fcrttemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen W\u00fcrttemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart.

The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Some of its most prominent companies include Daimler AG, Porsche, Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sika \u2013 all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.\nStuttgart is home to Germany's ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nThe city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg after Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and Freiburg.

Friedrich Schiller and the city's most famous Classicist architect, Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, were among its many esteemed alumni.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nThe first Waldorf School (also known as Rudolf Steiner School) was founded here in 1919 by the director of the Waldorf Astoria tobacco factory, Emil Molt, and Austrian social thinker Rudolf Steiner, a comprehensive school following Steiner's educational principles of anthroposophy and humanistic ideals. Today, four of these schools are located in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== International School ===\nSince 1985 Stuttgart is home to the International School of Stuttgart, one of fewer than 100 schools worldwide that offer all three International Baccalaureate programs- the IB Primary Years (Early Learning to Grade 5), IB Middle Years (Grade 6 to 10), IB Diploma (grades 11\u201312). The International School of Stuttgart is accredited by both the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.\n\n\n== Media and publishing ==\nOne of the headquarters of the public S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR; Southwest Broadcasting) channels (several radio and one TV channel; regional focus on the southwestern German States of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate) is located in Stuttgart (the other ones being Baden-Baden and Mainz).

The Reclam Verlag is located in nearby Ditzingen.\nThe newspapers Stuttgarter Zeitung (StZ; regional, with significant supra-regional, national and international sections) and Stuttgarter Nachrichten (StN; regional) are published here as well as a number of smaller, local papers such as Cannstatter Zeitung.\nAs is the case wherever the US military is stationed, there is an American Forces Network (AFN) station. It transmits on FM on 102.3 MHz from Fernmeldeturm Frauenkopf and on AM on 1143 kHz from Hirschlanden transmitter.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFollowing the suit of other German cities such as Berlin, Cologne and Hanover, on 1 March 2008 a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) came into effect in Stuttgart with the aim of improving air quality. This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (Umweltzone), including vehicles from abroad.\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\n\nStuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a 'U' symbol, which stands for Untergrundbahn (underground rail). Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfenbahnen AG (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the Stuttgart S-Bahn, using tracks supplied by the national Deutsche Bahn AG (DB).\nA peculiarity of Stuttgart is the Zahnradbahn, a rack railway that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch. It is the only urban rack railway in Germany. Stuttgart also has a Standseilbahn, a funicular railway that operates in the Heslach area and the forest cemetery (Waldfriedhof).

The local rail networks (see above) operate underneath the terminus.Stuttgart also has its own rail freight centre with marshalling yards and a container terminal in the Obert\u00fcrkheim area of Hedelfingen.\n\n\n=== Rail: The Stuttgart 21 project ===\nAfter years of political debate and controversy, plans were approved in October 2007 to convert the existing above-ground main train station to an underground through station. The Stuttgart 21 project will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart's enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and should be completed in 2020.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Stuttgart Airport (German: Flughafen Stuttgart, IATA airport code STR), an international airport approximately 13 km (8 mi) south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns. It takes 30 minutes to reach the airport from the city center using S-Bahn lines S2 or S3. Stuttgart airport is Germany's only international airport with one runway.

The Autobahn A831 is a short spur entering the southern side of Stuttgart.\n\nBesides these Autobahns, Stuttgart is served by a large number of expressways, many of which are built to Autobahn standards, and were once intended to carry an A-number. Important expressways like B10, B14, B27 and B29 connect Stuttgart with its suburbs. Due to the hilly surroundings, there are many road tunnels in and around Stuttgart.

          "The world\u2019s first tv tower is a good short activity to do whilst in Stuttgart. Interesting and fantastic views. Would recommend!",
          "We took Uber and arrived at this hill. The tower has 150 meters height, nice restaurant at the top. Not so expensive... nice experience.",
          "watch out with the weather when you go, when i went it was so windy i was afraid walk around freely. also the restaurant downstairs is very german and very quick but the staff is meh. the cafe upstairs in a fun place to grab a cup of tea. overall id say is a bit over-rated, the",
          "Coming here is simply a \"must\"! Working at Stuttgart from 217 meters height, is just amazing and It you get a sunny day, it is even better!",
          "We arrived at the attraction via bus, and I believe there's also a tram which you can take. To get to the attraction, you take a small walk through a wooded area, and then arrive at the tower itself. At the bottom of the tower, there appears to be a restaurant although this was",
          "There is amazing view to Berlin. In addition there is a lot of information on the desk next to the windows. You could read it if you want to. However, even without reading, there is nice place for taking pictures.",
          "Good view from the top and its very high. Staff were not friendly, and it was very busy but worth a visit for the experience.",
          "We went at late night , relatively empty , the feeling was nice , though there were not that much to see up there",
          "This was certainly worth the FREE admission with my StuttCard. It wasn't as easy to find from public transport as I had expected. There's actually a path through the woods to get to this (in one direction) and the sign pointing that way is a little small. Anyway, whiz up to the",
          "My wife and I visited this tower. I thought it was a little bit expensive for what it was. However, Stuttgart in general was a bit expensive. The view was nice, but nothing all that special.",
          "Located just out of the main city (I walked, 40 mins, but train and bus are close by) the tower provides a 360 degree view over the city and the surrounding area. There is a lift to take you to the top.",
          "Beautiful view. But, one staff from the restaurant, treated me horribly. Because I was speaking English and not German. Visit Germany, was always my dream. But been treated like S#*T... was very sad experience, I even cry. Just a quick tip, if you don't like tourists, don't work",
          "Stunning views of Stuttgart and surrounding areas from the top of this viewing tower. It's hard to believe that this was the first of its kind! The speedy lift takes you up the 150m in just 36 seconds. Definitely worth the trip.",
          "We went in the afternoon and it was a great view. The wind was blowing pretty good up top, so bring a jacket. Ate a quick bite at the cafe, which was nice as well.",
          "Wonderful views and great opportunity to really appreciate the beauty of the region. The white sausages were so good.",
          "I recommend to everyone who is in Stuttgart to visit Fernsehturm, it has beautiful view all around the building, also has coffee bar at the rop of the builder where I was drinking Hot Chocolate because I was there in the winter.. Also recommend to bring a warm jacket even if",
          "Great place to have an amazing city view. I would suggest going there about 40 minutes before sunset and it gets really crowded. Worth the wait as it gives a privileged view if Stuttgart and a beautiful sunset view.",
          "Amazing view and good food at the cafe on the top of the tower. The price (9 euros) is a little expensive, but you can have a discount showing a student card. Very recommended",
          "This tower is the first of its kind in the world and is about 150m in height. There is a lift that takes you up to the viewing gallery. The tower is open late so you can get great night view of Stuttgart. The greenery around the tower is remarkable. There is a nice cafe at the",
          "I am not a fan of heights but I was talked into going up in this building (which was really a radio tower). I was pleasantly surprised that I had no apprehension at all (which is good for someone who does not like heights. I was very glad I went. The view was fantastic you",
          "We went in the evening, which afforded some great views. Taking the above ground metro to there allows for some nice views through some pretty neighborhoods as well. It's a short walk along some pathways to get to the visitors' center at the base; the signage is pretty well",
          "Went up the tower when it opens at 10am. Full sunshine and great views from the top. Friendly staff on the reception and in the lift who speak English too. Can even see above the clouds at the top. You might not be able to get a seat in the cafe if you go at a busy time and the",
          "First tv tower in world and it\u2019s really nice. You can go to the top of it and enjoy a great view of Stuttgart. It might be a nice place to see night view but as it was raining we skipped it. Definitely one of the things to visit in Stuttgart",
          "Very nice page to visit with kids. It has great views and several restaurants on premises. Very easy to get in and out- and not very crowded. U-Bahn 29 goes there and it is very short stroll to get to the place.",
          "As expected the view from this tower were amazing. The lift gets to the top quickly although everyone looks at each other in silence. At \u20ac9 I felt it was a little expensive but we stayed for about an hour watching a balloon float by and the aircraft takeoff. The U15 stops about",
          "We walked to this iconic building from Stuttgart( about 4 miles). The walk in parts was very steep ( 22% incline), we walked through shopping precincts, residential areas (with some amazing houses) and some serene and peaceful forest ( with beautiful flora and fauna). When you",
          "Visited this place on a cold January evening! The place was full of ice. The elevator took us to the top deck in few minutes. Very windy at the top. Gives a wonderful view of Stuttgart...Roads, lights, vehicles, people and lots of snow all around! Must visit place but visit in",
          "I (we) were so pleased with the service (I believe he is from Albania). He took the time and explained the menu and wine.",
          "One stop I highly recommend is a visit to the TV tower in Stuttgart. It is the first TV tower in Germany built in 1957. It provides an eye-watering view of Stuttgart - best is to go at sunset and spend some time on the observation platform, then after the sun sets go down one",
          "It was about 10:30 pm at night when I was returning with my wife. As soon as you exit the Fernsehturm, there's a 400 m patch through the woods that leads you to the train station (Ruhbank). It was completely dark with no street lamps and when we were in the middle of it, we saw",
          "The views from the top of the tower were worth the trip by public transport. The viewing platforms gives a 360 degree view of Stuttgart city and the surrounding area. On a clear day you can see the football stadium and other large landmarks. The cafe at the top was extremely",
          "We visited the coffee bar at TV tower last week, but unfortunately I need to say that we were very disappointed. We had negative experience with the waiter, which I would like to describe below. When we came to the bar, there was one man leaving his table asking us whether we",
          "The views from the top are to die for. Rug up though, the day we went was cold enough to freeze your cheeks off. If you want to eat at the restaurant at the top, book ahead! If you dont, the restaurant at the bottom is great, just without the views.",
          "Fantastic views across the city from the 150m high viewing point, which highlight the mix of old and modern buildings throughout the area, and the areas of forestation interlinked with the suburbs of the city, but a bit expensive at \u20ac9 for a few minutes of taking photos.",
          "Go on a pretty day. We were there on May 1, a German Holiday, but the crowd was not bad at all. Beautiful views. Fascinating gift shop that also houses displays on the original construction. Good food at the restaurant at the base.",
          "Stuttgart is home to the world's very first television tower & Fernsehturm is definitely worth a visit. Located on a hill in the suburb of Degerloch, it is made of reinforced concrete, came into operation after a construction period of only 20 months, & is one of the city's most",
          "We took the on/off tour bus in Stuttgart and walked to the tower. We visited the cafe, had delicious cappuccinos and shared a pastry. Yum! Lovely day and great memories with my dad who took me to visit the city where I was born.",
          "Great experience - no waiting times for tickets and elevator, stunning view from the platform, long opening hours, cafe below the platform with excellent surround view and friendly service. Super helpful team - we had an elderly handicapped person with us. It is really worth the",
          "The tower offer a panoramic view of stuttgart. Its the first tower in the world so we have to visit it. Its good place for having a walk near.",
          "Great views, good food and some history lessons too. On the windows are comparisons to other observation towers around the world. This is one of the first in the line. With the view of the hills and valleys you can also see why a high tower was needed to reach everyone.",
          "Visited on a slightly cloudy December afternoon, but that didn\u2019t affect the experience. Views were still good and the food in the restaurant is excellent!",
          "Well worth a visit. Amazing views. We were so lucky the day we visited, weather was perfect. Cafe very reasonably priced for drinks. Handy to have a lift to the viewing platforms.",
          "Really amazing view :). Of course in the good weather, because witg fog or rain you won\u2019t see much. Nice gift shop downstair. Only problem is that dogs are not allowed :(",
          "The tower is easily accessed on the Stuttgart tram system, needless to say a little off the beaten track, but only a few meters from the tram stop. I took a party of a-level students with a colleague. Took a little persuading but had to drag them out afterwards. Thankfully",
          "In my personal opinion, if You are in Stuttgart for longer than week - it's one of must see. But to be honest, the main reason to ride to the top of Fersehturm is weather. I was there few times, both in good and bad weather, and if the visibility is not good, it is not worth it",
          "It\u00b4s not really an attraction. It\u00b4s a tower. There is view from it and nothing to look at. It is also quite expensive if you consider what are you getting for the money.",
          "Decided to take the trip at the last minute. It had rained the night before but had clear skies today. It was so cold and windy at the top. Nice view from every angle. Highly recommended",
          "It's a rather imposing structure enabling a nice view of Stuttgart. Unforttunately the coffee shop at the top offers averige tourist fare and the gift shoppe is not recomended!",
          "Went up in January and had viewing deck to ourselves. Could be because is was really cold and snowing so had no real view but was fun. A little expensive at 9euro a head for what it is though",
          "The actual observation decks are outdoors, and if the weather is a bit sour on the ground, it will be worse on top. Consider the weather before going up as it's 9 Euros each. We didn't have an alternative day so we went anyway. If you're taking the train, there's a little walk",
          "Visited on a slightly cloudy and foggy day, but we could still see surroundings. There is a great cafe serving breakfast and lunch over there which is worth visiting.",
          "Brilliant views of Stuttgart and the surrounding area, plus a very nice cafe in the top of the tower with fabulous window tables to enjoy the view from. Hadn't realised before going that the top of the tower is outside, with two levels, and then you can come down to the warmth",
          "The world's first ever TV tower. Definitely worth the trip via train and a short forest walk. Great views of the area.",
          "We paid the 9 euros each knowing the weather was not going to allow us the usual great views. Sad that our day was foggy. However, we did go in the lovely cafe at the top for a nice hot drink.",
          "It is really very high. \u0131f am i right it must be 250 m something like that. We visited there at night. During the night you can only see the lights of city . It was cold and windy . The elevator was good and very fast. We had a cup of coffee after the cold and wind at the",
          "A must visit...especially if you are interested in building and construction as it's the first tower to be constructed using reinforced concrete ;-) and of course view from the top is so amazing. You just have to see it.",
          "We have been there after the reopening for the first time with our children. The elevator is fast. The view over Stuttgart \"Kessel\" is fatastic. You have a great view over the cityand the german landscape in many directions. Especially to the Black forest witch is going to the",
          "Unfortunately we headed to the tower just as it began to snow so there was no view go see by the time we got to the top! So we decided to go to the cafe for tea and cHe instead. Here we encountered a rather aggressive waitress who misunderstood \u2018cappuccino cake\u2019 for a cappuccino",
          "My sister took me on a little adventure while on a visit to Stuttgart. We went to the TV tower. I know that doesn't sound very exciting, but it was much more than just a metal pole. Firstly, there is the walk from the bahn to get to the tower, a lovely meandering path. I",
          "We were lucky that the weather was so good! Normally Stuttgart doesn\u2019t get this sun in winter so the views were amazing!",
          "visited the tv tower last week. the walk to the tower is surrounded with trees and greenery. very peaceful. upon entry, you would then have to purchase a ticket and take the lift up to the top. the lift is very fast. at the top, you can get a very good view of the city. if you",
          "Had a day that was beautiful and went to the Television tower it was a clear day and the view was amazing.",
          "Take the funicular tram from Marienplatz and a lovely stroll through the suburbs and arrive at this iconic 1956 building. the view and the coofee and cake from the top is outstanding.",
          "You arrive to the top via elevator in 30sec, view platphorme is at 150m. Tower with antenna is 214 m tall, built in 1956. Very windy but view and experience is well worth it ! Also there is restaurant and cafe at 146m ! Must see in Stuttgart !",
          "Well for sure it\u2019s a place where you have a great access for the city But to reach you need to walk a bit trough the woods, in the end it\u2019s worthy of course. If you are in Stuttgart should consider visiting",
          "Such a fun thing to go see while in Stuttgart. Took the train to the top of the hill and then walked about 10 minutes through a walkpath and finally was at the base of the tower. It's HUGE! Visitor's Center was nice with lots of fun souvenirs. Ride to the top was an unbelievable",
          "Such a nice view over Stuttgart and it\u2019s surroundings. I used the metro and from station a nice walking trail through a nice forest to the tower. Worth a visit. You can plan half a day, walking through forest, to the tower top, a coffee at the cafe on tower top and then back.",
          "the first TV tower of its kind worldwide and still standing strong after all these years. An overpriced shop and fantastic views in all directions included",
          "Great view across the city so worth going up just for that. Not only are you over 500 feet up on the observation platform but the tower in on a hill as well. Many German cities have similar towers but this one was the first (not only in Germany but the first in the world) There",
          "Great place to be visited in Stuttgart. The surround is really great to walk. You can have a nice view from Stuttgart and areas around. Also a nice place to be visited with kids and for the whole family. A really a must in Stuttgart. Great time !",
          "Lovely good value trip. Was a long walk from the town but well worth it for the views. Coffee and apple strudel was nice too. If you visit Stuttgart it\u2019s deffo worth a visit.",
          "Goes very high. Higher than expected. Had plenty of walking space. I have been to a few that were too crowded to take a good picture but this place, even though there were a lot of people, was big enough.",
          "This is the best tower view spot that I\u2019ve seen. Very cool maps encircle the landing and are repeated in the windows of the cafe where you can get nice cakes, coffee, and brews.",
          "This is a must stop t see the entire area of Stuttgart. The views and being outside at that height was beautiful.",
          "Amazing view of the city! The coffee up in the top is great! Me and my wife was thrilled about the view and will be back in the summer!",
          "Since we married in October 2017 on top the Stuttgart television tower, we come to visit the first television tower in the word frequently. On top you have a great view all over Stuttgart - with good view you can see the Black Forest or the schw\u00e4bische Alb. It\u2019s always worth to",
          "A great visit to the fernsehturm - TV tower. It was a tad hazy when I visited, but the view was still really good. Given the folds in the topography of Stuttgart, there were a few surprises from this high point as to the actual relationships between various points. Some",
          "The view from the top of the tv tower is spectacular however it was a little disappointing in that once you have walked around the viewing platform the visit is all but over. I travelled with my wife and two kids and was quite disappointed in the homophobic attitude at this",
          "This tower really allows one to see the whole of Stuttgart. It is just over 216 meters high and was the first tower built using reinforced concrete. The price is about 7 euro for an adult and kids under 5 are free. It sports a cafe and a restaurant. Our party enjoyed a beer and",
          "We arrive around 13:00 was very warm and windy just the perfect weather we\u2019ve payed for the ticket \u20ac7 per person . We went up with a lift that is moving 250 meters per 5 seconds . The guy is explains you about this but he is not doing it in English . When you reach at the top",
          "Cheap entrance fee and nice city view from the tower. They have a large parking lot next to a beautiful park when you arrive to go up the tower. Pay the entrance fee and go into the the elevator. A lot of room up there and they also have a restaurant.",
          "Very nice view over the city of Stuttgart, definitely worth visiting. Despite the nice view, the bistro was disappointing.The waiter was very unfriedly and rude to the kids on the table beneath.",
          "We enjoyed a visit here whilst at the local beer festival. You take a short tram ride and then a nice stroll through woodland, that is well sign posted. The history of this tower is interesting, it' is the first TV tower in the world. Although it is a lot smaller than most that",
          "Now it's seems not so tall, but still, it's the first one. You can't miss to visit it when you're in stuttgart. You'll have beautiful view in sunset time \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d",
          "A true landmark of the region and with its well protected external observatory and the Panorama Cafe' is a must see of Stuttgart with good weather it offers a view of a good part of the region . Moreover reaching it from I be in Stations U7 U15 is a nice walk amid a wood of nice",
          "the view there is really amazing you can see everything , i feel so relaxed when i am in high like this",
          "The view from top is amazing. It is good to come evening and enjoy the cafe below so can see both of day time, sunset, and night time. It is pretty windy on top since it is all outdoor. Be prepared.",
          "One place not to miss is the TV tower. We also ate lunch there and enjoyed it very much. Don't forget to goto the upper level of the tower.",
          "The first European Television Tower to be erected is still functional as a viewing platform for tourists. Beautiful city views are available as you walk around either of the two 360\u00b0 platforms. On a clear day, one can see the Black Forest of Germany off in the distance. There",
          "This is among the must visit place in Stuttgart. You get a birds eye view of the entire city and can't get enough of it. There is a restaurant too at the top. The entry ticket is about 7 euro per person.Its very windy at the top somake sure you carry a jacket with you.",
          "Great views of Stuttgart and the surrounding area. Worth a visit if you have a stuttcard but over priced otherwise.",
          "Went on a Sunday evening. The viewing deck itself is not big but the views are stunning. There is a stairway to the upper deck which will offer unblocked view for pictures.",
          "During our Stay in Stuttgart we visited the TV Tower. The Lift brings you to 150m height where you have a spectacular view over Stuttgart. Not much else to do there.",
          "Ist's worth visiting this Tower. Entrance fee is ok and the Panorama Cafe is fantastic! The food is delicious and affordable price. Accessible with Bus ang train.",
          "We visited in the morning and it's a good time because is not crowded. Plan it on a sunny day because view is fantastic in all directions, you see the whole city and Swab Alps. The bar on top has normal prices for Germany, esspreso in 2.20 eur.",
          "It's beautiful place.weather is hot and all is clear and we see all city with eyes and around lot of green city",
          "The tower is historically significant for Stuttgart. Our hotel had its image in the wallpaper in the rooms even. Sadly, we visited on a rainy and windy evening, had to walk through a pitch dark path through a wood to get there and back from the tram stop and saw very little due",
          "Only for the view, you get to see from up there it is sooo worth to go. We had coffee and cake there. Their coffee is ok and the cakes were ok as well. Nothing special for me at least foodwise.",
          "Visited on a foggy day. The staff was nice. The prices in the caf\u00e9 on top are reasonable. The view was spectacular, no matter the weather.",
          "The TV tower is absolutely majestic and stands tall in Stuttgart, it has a huge significance in the history of the city. A tour to the top makes for a great view and photographs. The souvenir shop is also good where you can pick up a few souvenirs of the city as well as the",
          "It was winter and quite cold, but the view was completely worth it. The stunning city of Stuttgart is a wonder to behold. The elevator up to the top was incredibly quick without the feeling of \"losing your stomach\" that you would feel on most amusement park rides. This is",
          "Very high means very windy and cold...the view is really impressive and also the construction itself.",
          "One of the first of its kind, this tv tower is definitely iconic and wel worth a visit. Having been lucky enough to visit other viewing platforms such as the sky tree/Tokyo in comparison, the Stuttgart TV tower seems more organic, utilitarian not as cosmetic and plush as others",
          "I visited this place on Jan 1st 2018. we can reach to Fernsehturm with in 30 min from Stuttgart hafenbahnhof . Entry ticket fare is 7 euros. Fernsehturm is the first communication tower in the world. After 8PM entry ticket price is 4 euros. There are two lifts available to reach",
          "We were visiting Stuttgart on business, and had free time on a Saturday. We asked some of the locals where we should go and they suggested the television tower. They were right! The tower provides a great 360\u00b0 view of the area around Stuttgart. We checked out both of the",
          "Highest point above Stuttgart giving a marvelous view on the city and its surroundings. A highlight in daylight and at night. There is also a restaurant in the top",
          "Great date activity, go up during the day and at night, they\u2019re both really awesome experiences. It gets a bit cold up there though!",
          "Great views over Stuttgart and the surrounding countryside - even if Stuttgart is not the most attractive city getting a view from up high is good. The coffee shop at the top of the tower was OK too.",
          "Been with a group of 12 friends to the top of the TV tower under the heavy cold breezes. Excited to be part of one of its kind TV tower in the world. A 360 degree glance of Stuttgart and a hot coffee in the restaurant made our evening wonderful",
          "The cafe was nice and the views were beautiful, with views both of the town as well as of nature! We were blown away! (Almost literally).",
          "It\u2019s convenient to take public transportation there. We climbed up the tower, which was windy and cold up there. We loved the night view there. Beautiful scenery and fresh air made our night special.",
          "Last summer, I went visiting a friend of mine who I met in Dublin during my year abroad. He lives in Germany now and he was my tour guide around Stuttagrt for three days. From all the activities that we've done during those days, the Television Tower was without hesitation my",
          "Visited the television tower for something to do and to check it off our list. There was plenty of parking. The people who worked there spoke English, no problem. You take the elevator up to see almost 360\u00b0 views. We actually sat down and ate some dessert afterwards and then",
          "Very interesting place to visit! A great view of the city. The wind was blowing at the top at 50kms per hour, although it was a sunny day a jacket is a must!",
          "We went on a slightly hazy day. Recommend wearing a Jacket, cold up there in the wind. The Restaurant was let down by having only person serving in the afternoon and he seemed rather stretched.",
          "Really nice view and must have when visiting Stuttgart. Of course, when the weather is beautiful, it is more pleasant experience. I was there recently with my family and the only thing which was a bit annoying was traffic - you cannot really see everything what you want, no free",
          "A trip up the TV tower in Stuttgart is something I would recommend but more for the history. Elevators are a bit cramped but they move very quickly. And the viewing platform at the top can be very windy. I wouldn't recommend it for younger than 6 or 7. There is, however a nice",
          "Leonhardts restaurant at the top is overrated. The view is lovely the breakfast ok. Had the breakfast for two and had to ask for items missing twice, salad was not very fresh. Buns were not very fresh. The coffee was good! A rush of guest came in, but that shouldn't have",
          "With the Fernsehturm such an iconic sight in Berlin it was high on my list of places to visit. With so much to see & do in the city I decided to use the long opening hours to my advantage and buy a late night ticket for an aerial view of Berlin. Pre-booking was definitely",
          "The Television tower offers beautiful views of the city. It's not too expensive, and the restaurant with panoramic views is not too pricy either.",
          "the Fernsehturm was closed for a few years. I am so glad it is open again and my husband and I went this year. 50 years ago we went for coffee and cake on our wedding day to the tower",
          "We visited television tower during a rainy day, so we couldn't enjoy our stay as we were planing. However it was a little expensive, the quality of the plates and the service was great. Visit this place only when the weather is good.",
          "We tried to visit stuttgart tower, I made a mistake by confusing the discounted times, then the staff just said \"we can either pay full price or go.\" Which may not be the right reply, we looked at the ticket prices and wanted to get tickets-2 students, 1 adult-as my husband and",
          "Apparently all other viewing towers worldwide were based in the design of this one in Stuttgart. You are whisked up high very quickly in the small elevator but the views over the city are quite breathtaking. Well worth a visit and the entry price isn't too bad either.",
          "Well it's a landmark dotting Stuttgart's horizon and can be fun with young ones. Easily accessible by bus and U bhan. The ticket costs 7 Euro per adult and 4 Euros for kids above 5 years.But if it's summer then it's preferable to take the Abend ticket which costs 4.5 Euro per",
          "I wouldn't normally choose to go up a television tower but it was included in my 3 day Stuttcard tourist ticket. The tower is a short work from a train station and bus stop. There are two levels where you can walk around and enjoy the view or take photos. I was with a friend who",
          "It's off the beaten track and you possibly wouldn't spend more than an hour or so there but, it's well worth the visit. Stuttgart's transport system makes it easy to get to the tower. We visited Marienplatz first and then got on the rack train (included in your three day pass)",
          "This was my highlight of a 3 week tour to Stuttgart...the secret is to go at sunset. We went at 20:30 in middel May. To experience Stuttgart from above with a beautiful sunset to seal the deal was just lovely. We also had a beer and a coffee and it was priced relatively fine",
          "We went there after 2days in Stuttgart, so it was nice to see everything we visited from bird's perspective. It's a pity that there are no info panels on the top, so you can only guess what is on horizon. All in all, I'd go there if you have enough time and you have free tickets",
          "It is a tourist destination well worth the trip. You can take the train or go by car. There are two palaces to eat and a big play ground for kids.",
          "Take the tram to here for wonderful views of the city and beyond. Nice little cafe too. Friendly staff.",
          "Views from the top of the TV tower are amazing! Just some advice though -- bring a jacket or coat up with you as it can be extremely windy at the top. Our ears got blocked from the rapid pressure changes as the lift travels up and down very quickly.",
          "It is a nice way to see the city of Stuttgart from above. The restaurant up th\u00e9re is also veey good with veey good prices. You can enjoy the view while having a drink or something to eat. Also appropriate fir faimlies with small kids. I loved it You can enter for 7 Euros as",
          "While sitting at the Sky Bar, we saw the tower and decided to visit. Adults are just 7\u20ac, a steal for the amazing view! An elevator takes you to the top and there are two levels for viewing all of Stuttgart and the surrounding area. Parking is free.",
          "In Stuttgart there is a televison tower that will provide fabulous views of the surrounding countryside with a nice little cafe atop. Only 5 euros provide the round trip a spectacular vistas - 360 degree views. A worthwhile visit.",
          "Recommend to visiting this place to everyone. Absolutely wonderful landscapes! Also you can find special offers - sunset tickets \"good night\" cost only 4 \u20ac, starting from 8 pm. It is windy on the top of the tower.",
          "For a rush, a great view, a romantic date, this is an easy win. Only 7 euros to ride the elevator to the top and there are great views there. The caf\u00e9 inside is small but very nice, and the coffee and desserts were excellent. In my prime, this would have been an ideal place",
          "A great view from the top. A bit crowded on the viewing platfome, but we could still get around. Well organized",
          "This is a must if you visit Stuttgart. Great view from the top and a nice little cafe with panoramic windows that provides a nice place to sit, drink, and look over the city.",
          "Of interest for people with a touch for modern architectical solutions. The mothed of building such type of tv towers is presented in a godd way. Up on the top you can walk around and have a good view over Stuttgart area. Do it on a day with good weather.",
          "We decided to walk to this from Stuttgart one evening (spur of the moment). All I can say is its far and up a steep hill!!! It took us the best part of an hour to walk up there and it was dark by the time we got there. That said I still enjoyed viewing the city at night and the",
          "This TV tower was the first one of its type. Therefore, it is not so special. The view is atractive when you know the suroundings of Stuttgart, otherwhise it is just a view over a valley. It is not cheap and not extraordinary. After a certain time, the entry is half price!",
          "Beautiful view over the city and the area. It's only 7 euro for an adult, 4 euro for a student. Kids go up there for free. Also there's a really nice and affordable cafe on top.",
          "Nice vie i er the city. Has a souvenir shop, the panorama- Cafe was Ok. Sadly there was a female worker that wasnt very Kind. She was stressed without any reason. And also has no patience to the guests.",
          "Beautiful views of the city of Stuttgart and the surrounding area. However, the walk to the tower, the brief history of the tower on the ground floor, and the tower restaurant are not very impressive. Perhaps if we visited at sunset, or if it were a clear day, we would have been",
          "We are there to visit television tower and the night city of Stuttgart with Valeria, Ulrike and Shiva, really beautiful well maintain. One of the best place to visit while you are in Stuttgart. Thank you Valeria for your time to show us this amazing place.",
          "On a clear day the views the Fernsehturm offers are simply beautiful. You can see across the entire City, and enjoy something to eat or drink at the restaurant below the viewing platform. Highly recommend, don't miss this!!",
          "The Stuttgart TV tower was the first whisch was built in a one \"piece solution\". You can visit the tower almost all over the year. You have a great view over the City of Stuttgart and at good weather conditions you cann even see the black forest.",
          "Went up on a Friday evening to see a magnificent view of the city. The price was OK and we also stopped for a drink at the restaurant. Only difficulty was the path from the train was a bit dark so was a little afraid of tripping or running into something. Great visit",
          "Visited here with my colleagues. Was a Sunday afternoon. Was a nice place to be to. Had a nice view of the entire city from top. A liitle queue was there for the tickets. Takes 7 Euros to go the top. The tower is unique in the sense that it is unlike all the other famous",
          "What you see is what you get - one of the highest towers in Germany that offers spectacular views over all the surrounding scenery, you can literally see for miles around the country. It's not too expensive to take the lift up and definitely worth the money. There's also a bar",
          "We visited in October half term on a wet day. We arrived at opening and had to queue for about 20 minutes before going in. We were a party of three, 2 adults and a 5 year old. We enjoyed the lift to the top and the views, despite the weather. It was fairly quiet at the top of",
          "The lift takes you all the way to the top (thank goodness) and there is another platform via steps when you get to the top. There is also a restaurant/cafe at the top which was full so can't advise. The views from the top are amazing. Well worth a visit.",
          "Worth an hour of your time on a clear day. Great views! 7-8 dollars to take the elevator to the top.",
          "Definitely worth a visit! Just over \u20ac10 (maybe \u20ac15, can't remember) and gives fantastic views of the city. We went at night and it was brilliant and could see for miles. With a bar and restaurant at the top it was so good. We stayed at Alexanderplatz, but if not the S-Bahn",
          "We visited the TV tower at the beginning of February and with google maps showing only a two mile walk we decided that was the best idea. 45 minutes later we arrived at the tv tower and honestly the pain of the steep hills was worth it for the views and walk through the forest.",
          "Take time out from the city and come and visit this place. Its well connected by the U train service, don't be put off because it's not marked on the tourist maps you get from the tourist information centre. We took the U7 from the city centre as it has slightly less stops.",
          "Well Stuttgart is not really beautiful from high up here. I do not recommend the extra drive to the tower.",
          "This is the oldest TV tower in the world. The view is nice, you'll get to see both the city (from a fair distance, however) and the surroundings. The lines can be long, but tend to move fairly quickly. The cafe above is rather cramped, and not particularly spectacular, while",
          "Visited in January during the week so didn't queue at all, reasonably priced 13 euro per adult for the observation deck. (25% off with the Berlin welcome pass). Quick check through security as can be expected and up into the lift. The lift has a partial glass ceiling so you can",
          "From up the tower you have the most amazing view over Stuttgart. This is absolutely THE place to visit when it's good weather",
          "Great views of the city from the top of the tower, but very little information on the way up. If you don't use the WiFi and get the free app, there's barely any information.",
          "What an astounding view from the top. You can see most of the Stuttgart area from the viewing areas. Restaurant at the top though was understaffed and overpriced. Not worth money. Go and enjoy the view and skip the restaurant.",
          "We really enjoyed our trip to the television tower. You can see for miles and it has descriptions of where you are looking out to all the way around. There is a gift shop and also a beer garden where we had lunch. Very nice drive up to. We would recommend this trip to any",
          "View form the tower is super. I realy enjoy it. City is big and there is a lot to see. Two days isnt enough to see everything",
          "We visited here as part of a trip to stuttgart. The views are amazing and it's great value at 7 euros per person. It's accessible via the tram network. Worth a visit to have a drink in the highest bar in stuttgart",
          "Worth the time and price of admission, although we probably only spent 20 minutes looking around. The cafe below was great, especially in cold weather, I think we enjoyed the view from there even better, especially while sipping on a little something. The playground at the",
          "You have to walk about half km when you get to the local station, but the views are good. The cafe was ok, but was nice to get out of the cold!",
          "We spent a morning going to this TV tower, and we were very happy with the experience. The views of the city and surrounding countryside were spectacular. After taking the elevator to the observation deck on a very chilly day, we had a leisurely breakfast in the lovely and",
          "A great look out over the area. It's only a short train ride from the centre of Stuttgart and it was lovely to pass by other areas of the city. The tower is set in a lovely woodland area not far from the train stop. It only costs a small amount to ride the tower to the top which",
          "There you can find a nice view of Stuttgart. When I was there it was really windy what made me do a faster visit but it was really nice. They also have a nice bar up there!",
          "Finally the TV tower is open to the public again after some renovation work. Make sure you are prepared to some wind! It is always worth a visit and provides extraordinary views over Stuttgart and the surrounding.",
          "If you like to see the whole Stuttgart, this is the right place to visit. Summer must be nice while Autumn is already quite cold (with wind) up there. It's delightful to have a coffee in the restaurant on top before finishing the visit.",
          "In Degerloch a short subway ride away. The worlds first TV tower built of concrete. Panoramic view from the cafe on top is magnificent. Well worth the visit",
          "A very nice experience. Staff were pleasant and helpful and the experience only costs 7 euros. The TV tower is easily reached by metro and a lift to the top floors doesn't take long. Two floors at the top allow stunning views across the region and Stuttgart. A restaurant floor",
          "Very beautiful located on the hills of stuttgart this was the first tv tower of its kind. It looks beautiful and you have wonderful view over stuttgart and the region. The hace a cafe up there to enjoy the view and have a snack and drink",
          "Wow!! Indeed! The views from the Tower were spectacular and make you realise how lovely and green Stuttgart is... We took the scenic tram route to the Tower Station and followed a group of people who looked like they knew where they were going! (Through a forest to get to the",
          "Always, I see the Tower it is a little historical for me. You have a wonderful round view over Stuttgart and the Region.You see the Airport, the wine hillsand other nice landmarks. If your not interested in the view, you can also go in the cafe and enjoy a cake and a coffee,",
          "It\u00b4s a bit expensive to get up there but once you enjoy view you\u00b4re most likely to forget about this. So interesting to see the town from a bird\u00b4s eye view.",
          "If you wish to obtain an awesome view of Berlin, there are better ways to spend your Euros - or even not. The Reichstag dome is free and the Berliner Dom is just a few Euros. The Fernsehturm is EXPENSIVE. Whilst there are boards explaining what you're looking at, you'll have",
          "This is a must visit attraction . It is not far from Stuttgart mitte just 20 minutes by U Bahn , U 7 Ruhbank . The area is fantastic and full of green. It is not expensive only 7 \u20ac per adult. The view from the top is stunning and breathtaking. I bought the ticket from there",
          "For the few Euros entry fee, a magnificent view of the city is available. Cafe prices are surprisingly reasonable.",
          "We were lucky to have no waiting time for the elevator. A very windy day, but stunning views. We enjoyed our lunch, good local dishes to choose from. Friendly staff. A nice feature are all the distances given to close and far away places.",
          "Spend some time walking around the open observation decks and you'll get a truly unique view of Stuttgart and the surrounding area. There are small panels describing what is off in the distance in each direction, which was helpful in identifying nearby local landmarks, but also",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Fernsehturm with some fabulous views of Stuttgart and the surrounding towns and countryside. Located in a nice area of the city and is a pleasant walk up to the tower. Would definitely recommend a visit for any tourist to Stuttgart.",
          "It is not the highest, but the very first TV Tower. It is not the fastest Elevator, nor is the Restaurant turning around. But you can stay outside on the terrace and from the top of the hill you have a wonderful view. Come early, otherwise it might be crowded.",
          "When visiting any city for the first time, it's good to get your bearings. This is the place to start in Stuttgart. 360\u00b0 view of the city and surrounding countryside. Small fee to ride up to two observation decks. Snacks and souvenirs available. Ample free parking. Easy to find",

          "From the tower you will see some nice views of the city and surroudings. I can't imagine that there are spectaculair views at night because the tower is pretty much out of town. The is a little restaurant just under the viewingplatforms with the same views but without the",

          "I went here in the evening, and had some great views around sunset. You can see the city slowly come to life as all the lights come on at night time. The food is ok at the top of the tower, but the service is slow. While I was there, there were only 2 waiters, and it was busy.",

          "The TV tower is a great attraction to Stuttgart! I am very happy the re-opened it after 2 years of being closed. The view during the day and night are both must-sees. You can also enjoy a drink or meal from the cafe at the top, a nice way to enjoy and view Stuttgart.",
          "I have seen just outside'cause it's closed until January 30th, 2016. It's amazing, 200 metres tall, I went to the tower in night time, it was foggy and the tower was huge and beautiful through the fog. Outstanding position, uphill. It dominates all the town. To be visited when",
          "When you're on top, there is a nice view over the city. But there are steel girders between the windows, which makes the view less.. It was nice to see Berlin from the top, but it wasn't worth it.",
          "Queuing inevitable as this is a very popular attraction. I would recommend visiting towards the end of your visit to Berlin so you can recognise some of the sights you have visited. Not too good for photos through the dusty glass and some of the orienteering pictures of what",
          "The waiting queue was way too long just to see Berlin from above. Even though I was on holiday I could not afford waiting for almost 3 hours to get to the top. At least you are clearly informed about your waiting time.",
          "Worth the wait but you can pre book a time so you are not waiting on busy days. There is security screening of bags and people before accessing the lifts. The lifts move at high speed and manned by friendly staff. You can book the restaurant as well but pricy. On the viewing",
          "A trip up this testament to Soviet occupation is well worth it to get an overview of West and East Berlin. The usual rubbish gift shop, a bar and an expensive revolving restaurant are also here if you want them.",
          "Although it is now currently closed a great time for a visit by a brighter time and pleasant time for a drink or meal at a high level !",
          "Last minute decision to go up the tower - I have vertigo so didn't want to think about it too much!! Lift is so quick (and internal thankfully) that you don't realise how far up you have traveled. The view from the viewing gallery is stupendous. A full 360 view of Berlin and way",
          "Located in the center of Alexanderplatz this attraction gives you a 360 birds eye view on the city of Berlin and the horizon. It is quite enjoyable on clear days are you can see beyond the city. The price is correct (though maybe a bit expensive) for the standard lines.",
          "The tower offers you an elevator to go up and have a view of the city. It goes really high, but you also need a good day to be able to have nice views.",
          "The lift was really quick. We had a cocktail up in the bar but didn't do the restaurant. It was a cloudy day so we didn't have much of a view. When you pay downstairs, you can ask the cashier what's the view like and he will show you on his screen, the camera view from up top,",
          "The tower was totally worth the visit. However the first day I went (a nice sunny day) we had to wait over two hours just to get in and it was almost dark. We tried again earlier the next day. We had to wait the same two hours but we got up earlier. Unfortunately there was fog",

          "Its a nice place outside Stuttgart, with a impressive view over the sourroundings. It has a nice restaurant, even if it might be a little difficult getting a table there. If you got some time, I would recommend walking to this place from the city centre, as you will get a nice",

          "The tower provides a great view of the Stuttgart area. It is interesting how \u201cgreen\u201d the city is. The directions to world and regional cities is interesting, but in the end, you are only here for the view. The cafe at the top is nice, and the prices are reasonable. Recommend",
          "Nice park around, easy to reach it, but the best is the coffe restaurant on the floor below the top. Enjoying a beer looking Stuttgart from the top is a must.",
          "The first TV tower in the world was built in Stuttgart. Unfortunately it is closed due to fire safety reasons. A schedule for reopening was not made by the administration.",
          "Unfortunately, the TV tower was closed. I was lucky enough to go up last Sept (2012). The views were great, the food service at the top wasn't. But then again, you are there for the views, not the food. Having a drink (whether it was coffee or cocktail), the cost was a",
          "This place has a great view of Stuttgart and is mostly surrounded by wine grapes. It's worth the view (and it can be windy up there!) at least once if you're in Stuttgart.",
          "I have visited the stuttgart television tower many times over the years, partly because my husband's father was one of the men involved in building it and partly because of the amazing view over Stuttgart.",
          "Great views but pick a sunny day. The 360-degree bronze relief of the vincinity and horizon was especially fun. The menu and coffee were adequate.",
          "I ve been there last year and the view was excellent. But the city council closed the tower in april 2013 due to safety regulations. Maybe they open it again. It is definitely a good place to go if you have some free time.",
          "My boyfriend and I truly enjoyed the views from this tower. It was a bit crowded and hard to do a solo photo-op without strangers in the background. However, it is a must to see the whole city of Stuttgart. Truly breathtaking views. There is a small cafe that offers snacks",
          "closed due to safety regulations.(no fire escape plan) I have heard this is because in case of a fire that there is no way to evacuate everyone.The city has plenty of money to resolve this so perhaps it may open again in the near future.",
          "You should climb in this television tower for a great panorama over the city and you can also dine at the rotating restaurants on the top platform.",
          "Can you believe it? This Tower was constructed back in 1954. Stills looks technologically advanced. It's a must visit in Stuttgart. View from the top is awesome. There is a restaurant also at top.",
          "Okay, but can be done much better. For example they can have a map around the top of the tower showing all of the sites you can view from the tower.",
          "This offers a great view of the city. It is also cool that they put a lot of famous cities on the map so you can get directionized with where you are looking. Wanted to stop in the cafe for a beer, but was closing.",
          "Must visit place if you are in Stuttgart. I went there in the morning and was lucky to have sun after weeks which made views fabulous. Place is windy and you have to have your coat along when you go up. It is tricky to get there if you are using S / U BAN trains. You have to",
          "For \u20ac5 entry I think this is excellent value for the best views across Stuttgart and beyond to the Black Forest.",
          "Quite interesting! The first tv tower on the world. The view from the top is huge. The tower' s technical description and its history are quite interesting. You have to pay for the elevator. But it is cheap On the top there is a pretty coffe shop. Enjoy it!",
          "The television tower is well worth a visit. The views from the top are spectacular, great photo opportunities!",
          "You should wait for a really sunny day to see the horizon. 5E fee is acceptable, but not really a bergain.",
          "The TV tower is a great place to get a spectacular panoramic view of Stuttgart and its surroundings. Entry is not unreasonably priced, the ride to the top with an elevator takes a couple of minutes and its all worth the view. There is a panoramic cafe beneath the observation",
          "Came here to enjoy the view and celebrate a friends birthday. We enjoyed both. Dinner was at the \"Unten\" restaurant, but we also had drinks at the \"Oben\" bar. Although pricey the atmosphere was welcoming and the food was very good. I would consider coming here again for",
          "Great view and place to have a cappuccino overlooking Stuttgart. Lots of great hiking trails around the base of the tower as well.",
          "This TV Tower was the 1st build with a fat base of concrete and than up in the sky. Every tower that was build later is constructed like the Fernsehturm. It is old but still very elegant - like the fine old Mercedes or Porsche that where build at the same time. Make sure you go",
          "Ok folks, the biggest criteria to go to the TV tower is weather plays an important role and well i am not talking about the rains, its the clouds which can play spoilsport. Plan your visit to this TV tower on a sunny day and go an hour before sunset so that you can view the city",
          "It\u2019s not particularly easy to reach the TV Tower, especially as when we visited Stuttgart had experienced the snowiest October weather for decades. However we began at Marienplatz and took the Stuttgart Rack Railway (Zahnradbahn Stuttgart) up the hill getting off at the second",
          "A 20 minute ride from central station (hauptbahnhof) takes you to the stop for this attraction. However, you still need a 10 minute walk through an unlit wood to get to the tower. No issues during the day, but very dark at night. Its quite safe, but could be unnerving for some.",
          "You need to make a long trip to the television tower and in my opinions the views from top are not breathtaking. The tower is too far away from the city centre to see historic buildings well; generally the view is a bit chaotic and without outstanding points. The viewing",
          "Worth a visit if you're in Stuttgart and have an hour or so to kill. 5 Euros gets you a ticket to the viewing platform for amazing views and photo opportunities. Go on a clear day! The tower is sited in a wooded area and has a pleasant bar/restaurant at its foot with outside",
          "Not the easiest to locate without a map, which sounds odd as you'd think a tall tv tower would be easy to find, but the rough guide doesn't make it clear that it is a fair trek from the Zacke to the tower, at least 15 minute walk, and is hidden by dense wooded areas that",
          "So the song goes and a visit here you really can. The day we went was a little bit windy but throughly enjoyable. You can always finish off on colder days with a nice hot drink in the cafe just below the viewing deck.",
          "I enjoyed my visit here. There is also a bar at the top in addition to a restaurant and beer garden at the bottom. The views were beautiful - especially at sunset.",
          "I went with local friends after dark and really enjoyed the view. I think however going before the sun sets would be a good idea - the upper platform has a guide to what you are looking at that's not easily visible by night.",
          "It's one of the main attractions and well, you have been to one such Tower, you have been to all of them is my opinion. It's really only about the outlooks over the whole Stuttgart. If this is something you value go for a view, otherwise keep your money and have a beer in the",
          "I try to take all my visitors to the top of the Stuttgart TV Tower. In comparison to similar experiences around the world, the Stuttgart tower is good value for money and entry is a simple process. The views from the top are outstanding and made even better by the fact that",
          "Very nice landscape blick from turm. The seccond best look is from TeeHouse (and it s for free), but TvTurm of course is special. It s worth it, if go there with StutCart for half price.",
          "The views from the top are breath taking, make sure you hav a jacket as the winds can be strong.",
          "Access is easy to find, good parking possibilities. Small shop but the best is the breathtaking view over Stuttgart. Great opportunity for taking photographs.",
          "Nice quick tour for the family. Costs was 16 euros for a family of 4. You can do the entire tour in less than an hour. Visibility was great, and we toured during light rain. You felt secure with the 4 feet of safety bars around you. Nice cafe located at the top and restaurant",
          "Not for me! I didn't bother to get close to the Fernsehturm, for my money when you have seen one you have seen them all. This one does occupy the skyline and unless you want to rise to a height then its easy to give it a miss.",
          "I was in Stuffgart on the weekend of a transit strike. That doesn't dissuade me as I prefer to walk wherever I can. We chose to walk from city centre to the TV tower - despite the unfounded warnings from the locals. I guess their concern was that the trek is mostly uphill, and",
          "Or so it seems. The TV Tower in Degerloch up on the ridge overlooking the city of Stuttgart in a must see simply for the 360 degree view of the lay of the Schwabian landscape. Grab a bockwurst mit brotchen und senf, take your place in the observation tower and observe the world",
          "Obvious comment but to get the most out of the tower it needs to be a clear day. There is not much else around the tower, some woods if you fancy a little walk but really just the tower itself. There is parking available, we didnt have a problem but it didnt look to be a very",
          "Nice view, however there isn't much more than a pretzel and a cup of coffee at the top. Nice for a quick trip up and down the elevator.",
          "It is only really worth visiting the tv tower if it is a clear day and not too windy. The lookout tower is located a speedy lift journey up above Stuttgart. The views are great: you can see the planes taking off and landing, landmarks in the center of town and also the Fildern",
          "An absolutely beautiful view of the city at night. Have a drink here. The atmosphere is zero. But the view is tremendous. And the drinks are great",
          "The view is amazing and the food not bad, Service was friendly though , Food, Service, Atmosphere, Value is goooooood",
          "If you are doing the Hop On Hop Off bus then it is well worth stopping here and going up the tower. The views from the top are excellent.",
          "Awesome views of the city, the valley and the many smaller towns in the area. Well worth time time.",
          "On a clear day, this provides the best view of Stuttgart and the surrounding area. Very quick ride via elevator to the top viewing deck and restaurant. Stopped for coffee really enjoyed the visit - plan to return and bring visitors to Stuttgart, well worth the time.",
          "was great to be on the top, we had good weather and the far sight was phenomenal. Also the waiting times at the lift are absolute ok. Don't think you will get a free table in the little coffee ..... :-)",
          "the train ride takes about 25 minutes from the main station and then its at least about a 10 minute walk to the tower. It was well worth it, factor in time to get a drink or snack at the restaurant there. the views were wonderful. we were very glad we made the trip!",
          "We went in the morning during December so it is pretty chilly up. Make sure to bring a jacket. I went with my husband and five year old daughter. Make sure to bring some Euro up with you if you like to collect pressed coins. We took some great pictures up top and it was not very",
          "You have a good view of the area from on top, it's not as classy as the CN Tower in Toronto, the Space Needle in Seattle or the Tower of America in San Antonio, but it'll do. It's cheaper to go up to the top in a group.",
          "After so many amazing views from castles, Hillsides and the Alps this was such a let down!! The views are really poor. Not sure what the draw is here. I took one of our houseguests as a mini-sight and wished we had just done Konigstrasse or a cafe instead.",
          "We visited on a very grey day but the views were still stunning. he winds on the outsie viewing platform were incredibly strong. I weigh 100 kg and it was physically pushing me backwards - so hang on to little kids and light people. Very safe though - built by Germans. A little",
          "If you have time - it's some 20 minutes from the city centre by tram - the Ferneshturm is a good place to visit. It provides nice views from the Stuttgart region - be aware that it is a bit far from the city so what you get is mostly a view from its surrounding suburbs. There's",
          "Not only is this a historical TV tower but the view into Stuttgart and the region make the trip to the TV tower worth a detour from downtown. If you are in Stuttgart for a few days then a trip to the TV tower should be on your list of this to do. Accessible by the U-Bahn system",
          "The TV Tower provides you with a great view of Stuttgart and the surrounding area. The area around the tower offers nice hiking. The tower was bought by a local radio station last year and they are struggling to find a way to keep the restaurant and cafe at the top in",
          "I don't understand how so many people can like this tower. It's terribly simple and not worth the 5\u20ac you have to pay go there. The caf\u00e9 has a terribly inadequate menu and looks really shabby. It's really small - and the view isn't that much better than in the Hauptbahnhof or",
          "They are currently renovating the restaurant at the top of the tower, but the biergarten at the base is nice in warm weather. The price is a little much, but it's a nice way to spend an afternoon and the view is beautiful. I recommend going on a clear day so that you can get",
          "Not a lot open on Monday's so I went here to see the TV tower. It is odd that is seems so empty, but once I went in they were having an event with name tags and such, it was lunch time so most of them were out side on the trials. No one spoke much English so I mimed my way in",
          "After seeing that the TV Tower was number 8 on the list here I decided to go and visit last Thursday, 25th March. After spending my 5 Euros to go up I was severely disappointed. The restaurant is now closed due to lack of patrons, and the caf\u00e9, if you can call it that is",
          "I and two friends went to the TV tower last week... Tram line 15 takes you straight there and the entry fee is only 3 euros A lift takes you all the way to the top of the tower and it is amazing. You can see airplanes landing/taking off from Stuttgart airtport, and you see for",
          "The Stuttgart Television Broadcast Tower (Fernsehturm) is definitely worth a visit. Located on a hill in the suburb of Degerloch, the tower's observation platform provides an unequalled view of the city environs of Stuttgart to the north and west, the Swabian Alb to the east,"

          "In a very large plaza sits this palace from centuries ago. The palace looks very modern possibly from the reconstruction. At night, not too many strolling about the entrance. So thus, no one entering otherwise we would have gone in. I am reading it's not open to the general public, only to special people or groups.",
          "Best view over Stuttgart. Food and hospitality in need of improvement.",
          "This place was amazing even in rainy weather, the views are stunning when you're above the clouds. The ride up was also great with the fast elevator in just 35 seconds 150 meters.",

          "Very nice view of the city. A little windy up there. Be prepared with 1\u20ac coins if you want to use the binoculars at the top. Also there's a machine up there that makes coins imprinted with the tower (that needs 1\u20ac as pay and 5 cent coin which it stamps the tower on).",
          "A little difficult to walk to from the team, particularly in the dark at night. The views were decent enough.",
          "It's a nice place to visit. Especially if it's for sunset or sunrise. The entirety of Stuttgart is a view to behold at sunset.",

          "Good hot chocolate in the restaurant.",
          "It really is a magnificent view. It cost me \u20ac9 to take the ride up. Looking out over the land is beautiful and I enjoyed it. There is a cafe there, I ordered a chai tea latte and a slice of cake. Both were very good.",
          "Not much exited... Nice forest walk...",

          "Stuttgart landmark. Must go & see. There is a nice restaurant at the entrance.",

          "Wonderful view over the city of Stuttgart. Good food, the tuna is recommendable.",
          "We took the U-Bahn up but jumped out earlier so that we could walk the rest of the way through the first to get there. Was a great decision! Beautiful path through nature. Once getting there we were disappointed at the already long queue and quite expensive price to go up for the viewing. Still a great view of Stuggi.",
          "This was a fun experience to finish off a trip to Stuttgart. Great view, it was a little stormy but it was very stormy on the observation deck. Nice little restaurant up top and fun items in the gift shop.",

          "Nice, it cost 9\u20ac",
          "Nice views from here - but it's pretty open to any winds - so be careful. Didn't have a chance to visit restaurant - but should be interesting. You will need to use you existing ticket to exit deck - so do not loose it",
          "It's not like Paris but if you like to get view of the city it may be a good place to have a look. And the sunset",
          "Super cool place. They won't let you go up the stairs to the top, but that's okay. I lived the cafe, and it wasn't that full with great views.",

          "It is nice place .. but it was close .. I dont know why",

          "Been at the TV tower the first time again after 20 years and was impressed! It was awesome. I regretted not visiting for so long as the view up there is so nice. \nSpent 1 hour up there and it wasn't really relaxed with less people than expected.\nHighly recommend a visit of the world's first TV tower",
          "A place you have to visit while in Stuttgart! Great view, a little bit windy on 150 meters, but 3 meter below there is a restaurant with great unfiltered beer - not so cheap tho. Entry is 9\u20ac.",

          "Its a nice place to see the city",
          "You get a nice view of the city and the surrounding areas. Beneath the tower is a sports complex so you may be lucky to watch some football match or tennis. There's also a restaurant one floor below the observation deck. All in all its a nice place to spend at least 20~30 minutes.",
          "Highly recommend \u2764\ufe0f",

          "Great view. Interesting facts. Good for children.",
          "Great way to view the city and the surrounding area. The day we were there we had both sun and clouds, but it made the experience nice. There is a cafe up in the tower which is really nice, however because we went on 31 December afternoon \u2026",
          "This was a great start to a trip to Stuttgart.  We actually walked from the centre of Stuttgart, which was great fun but not for the unfit (lots and lots of steps), a great way to get there though. A spectacular view from the top and a fun \u2026",
          "It is wasting my time to go there, want to enjoy a dinner at the top cafe, but no one serving",

          "Amazing view to the Stuttgart city...",
          "Nice trip, nice sunset, a bit expensive to go up. You will find an amazing view over Stuttgart city from up there. You can see the hole city and see the sunset in the horizon. It was a very nice experience just a bit to expensive, 9\u20ac to go up on an elevator seems a bit to much.",
          "Incredible views across Stuttgart and very nice food.",
          "Wonderful landscape at the top of this building, there's also like a little museum about all the things towers in the world... The biggest one is in Tokyo, but 2nd biggest one is in Frankfurt, GERMANY!! Germans really love the towers ahaha, \u2026",

          "Beautiful. Great place to vacation. Want to go back.",
          "Best view of Stuttgart and the surrounding area. The viewing platform has a map to show you the landmarks in the distance and to orient you to far off places. It is easy to get to by train and the elevator is quick to get you to the top. It \u2026",
          "TV tower is one of the iconic spots in Stuttgart",
          "Nice walk up but when you get there everything is closed... just a coffee shop with not even a view. However, you can apparently go up. When we went at 17:30 it was closed too.",
          "Great fun with friends. We arrived at a good time so the lines were short. It was very crowded though. After spending time walking around on the top level we went to the restaurant where we enjoyed drinks and dessert. Delicious, and the view is awesome.",

          "The entry price is very reasonable - 9\u20ac for adults and 5\u20ac for students. The elevator goes up real quick and there is also a nice bar up there where you can have drinks/dessert for normal prices as well.",
          "Great views of Stuttgart and the surrounding area. Entry fee not too expensive. Nice cafe at the top, but make sure you take cash as it does not accept cards. I did not visit the gift shop at the bottom, but it looked well stocked.",
          "Easy to access and wonderful views. I was actually surprised that there was almost no queuing and waiting. Once you're up at the top, it can get windy (duh!), so bring a windbreaker or something.",
          "Nice view, but for me overprised (9\u20ac adult, 5\u20ac child ticket). The girls in the shop were friendly, but the waiters in the coffee bar, weren't! I would not go again, unless I must.",
          "Awesome place to go and see the city and surroundings. I'd recommend going there just before sunset such that you can still enjoy the city but also have an amazing sunset. The cafe in the tower is also a great place to have a coffee etc.",
          "Stunning panoramic views of Stuttgart from 150 mts above the city",
          "Very pretty view, specially during sunset. The cafe is average in price.",
          "Offers a nice view over the city of Stuttgart. The entry ticket is a bit expensive (9 euro). The parking is free and near the tower. There is a gift shop and a restaurant. You can only go up with the elevator. Overall a nice experience but not 5 stars because of the price.",
          "Has a great view of the city of Stuttgart (at a price of 9 euros).",
          "Nice Place. Ticket price is 9 Euro. \nFollow me on instagram/kkmendon",

          "Panorama was amazing.",
          "Lovely views of the city. We visited for free with our Stuttcard passes. The elevator ride was very quick.  I will say that there was a little mud on the trail to get to the entrance coming from the metro station so maybe don't wear your \u2026",

          "The tower is a mess and you notice that very fast... \nThe have a (cr)app to give you tours online bit the app is not even able to run on at least 2 Smartphones... The panorama coffee doesn't have the things they offer in the menu and the \u2026",
          "Good place to have a 360\u00b0 view of Stuttgart and its surroundings.",

          "Amazing birds eye view of the city. Best time to visit is during the sunset. You get to see the sum going down. And if you stay for few more minutes you can see the city lighting up. We had visited this place on Monday evening and the ticket price is reduced. See the website for the information about the ticket price.",
          "Food was good, views are expectedly superb, gift shop selection is limited",
          "Very interesting place! In bright days you can see all the city.",
          "Best Place to feel the cold air",
          "A nice trip could be to take the U14 from main station towards Heslach, exit Marienplatz and take the \"Zacke\" to \"N\u00e4gelestra\u00dfe, then take a short walk through the forrest to the TV tower. Then after having visited it, take U7 to Killesberg and give a visit to the Weissenhof Siedlung. Take Bus 43 (or 4x) back to the city center.",
          "If you are not afraid of heights, you must visit the Fernsehturm!",

          "Very good panorama from the top, I went to the bar/restaurant and the staff was gentle but the food (I had a piece of cake) wasn't that good, it was too sweet and not so fresh.",
          "Enjoyed the beautiful sunset with family",
          "You have a great sight from up there, I had a really good time and I recommend it to all of you, because you have quite fun seeing where you've been and where you want to go(Only if you've been already in other places or if you organized your trip alredy) .

          "Good experience, can get the train to just down the road from it. There's two upper outside decks, 1 floor dedicated to the cafe and another inside viewing floor. This wasn't obvious to us so we stayed on the top two outside viewing decks so a bit more signage or a nap would be good. Overall though, well worth a visit.",
          "Best view over Stuggi City",
          "A place you must visit. All Stuttgart is around you and the view is spectacular. Ofcourse is wouod be the best if it is a sunny day but even it is a little cloudy you can enjoy it.

          "If you go there when it is dark it was quite hard to find. I used Google maps for walking directions, and was directed off on a very long walk along a trafficked road. Either it was gmaps, or the tower that had some problems presenting a sane way to walk there fr.o.m the U-Bahn.",
          "Over 150 meters high, first of its kind, built in the fifties. 7 euro is well worth the price. There is a small restaurant right below the viewing platform. We went around late in the afternoon, it got really windy and cold up top. During our visit, it was not busy at all, nice.",

        "wiki": "The Killesberg Tower is a 40.4-meter high observation tower located in the Killesberg Park in Stuttgart, Germany. Originally planned for the 1993 World Horticultural Exposition, it was erected only in 2001.\n\n\n== Predecessor ==\nAs early as for the 1939 German Horticultural Exposition an observation tower was planned. It was eventually erected in 1950 and dubbed Zaiser Tower after the company that donated it. At its tip, a radio transmitter was mounted. The Zaiser Tower was demolished in 1974 because the necessary funds for its renovation could not be raised.\n\n\n== Guiding Principle and Objectives ==\nIn 1985 the City of Stuttgart received the contract for the 1993 World Horticultural Exposition (Internationale Gartenbauausstellung, IGA). In order to offer visitors an overview over a major part of the grounds, an artificial elevation was necessary. The site on the Killesberg where the previous tower had been located seemed suitable.\nMore difficult than finding a suitable location proved the search for an appropriate design. The tower should be delicate and fit into its surroundings. The ambitious objective was to prove that modern construction engineering can be environmentally friendly, even when the tower is high and features several large observation decks.\nEventually, J\u00f6rg Schlaich suggested a cable net construction based on the model of cable net cooling towers for power plants.\n\n\n== Project History ==\nThe first plans were developed in 1986 and worked out in more detail until 1991. However, the Stuttgart city council stopped the project because the IGA management had exceeded their budget. Subsequently, the Versch\u00f6nerungsverein Stuttgart (Embellishing Society) was asked for support. This organization had experience with local development programs as well as with collecting donations. In 1998, long after the IGA was finished, they had raised enough funds to start building the tower, among others by offering sponsorships to companies as well as private persons in exchange for mounting their name plates on individual tower steps. The tower was inaugurated on July 17, 2001.\n\n\n== Design ==\nSignificant design elements of the tower are the central mast whose heel is hinged via a steel ball to the central foundation, and the steel cable net of triangular meshes. The net is tensioned between a circular concrete foundation and a pressure ring at an altitude of 33.5 meters which in turn is suspended from the mast head by cables.\nThe four observation decks at 8, 16, 24, and 31 meters are hinged to the mast and at their circumference connected to the net by press fittings.\nThe two spiral staircases, one for ascending, one for descending, are carried only by the cable net.\nFor the suspension and the net cables open spiral cables with diameter of 18 mm resp. 24 mm were used, consisting of 37 resp. 61 strands of 2.6 mm diameter. Their tensile strength is 1.57 kN/mm\u00b2. Due to their relative high strength they are less susceptible to press forces exerted by the fittings, e.g. for the observation decks.\nAll cables and fittings are galvanized. In addition, all steel construction elements received a double paint coat. The hollow sections, i.e. the mast and the stair tubes, are galvanized on both their inner and outer surfaces.\n\n\n== Access ==\nAccess to the park and the tower is free of charge. For the tower, a voluntary contribution is asked for. Opening hours are from 7 a.m. until nightfall.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nFor primary sources and additional information see Killesbergturm (mostly in German)",

Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:\n\nThe Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534. Exterior: Romanesque/Gothic; interior: Romanesque/Gothic/Modern. Reconstructed with simplified interior after World War II.\nAltes Schloss (the Old Castle), mostly dating from the late 15th century, some parts date back to 1320. Renaissance style; reconstructed\nAlte Kanzlei (the Old Chancellery) on Schillerplatz square which backs onto the 1598 Mercury Pillar\nNeues Schloss (the New Castle), completed in 1807. Baroque/Classicism); reconstructed with modern interior, currently houses government offices. The cellars with a collection of stone fragments from the Roman times are open to visitors\nWilhelmpalais (the King Wilhelm Palais), 1840\nK\u00f6nigsbau (the King's Building), 1850. Classicism; reconstructed; has been housing the \"K\u00f6nigsbau Passagen\" shopping centre since 2006.\nThe Gro\u00dfes Haus of Stuttgart National Theatre, 1909\u20131912\nMarkthalle Market Hall, 1910. (Art Nouveau)\nThe Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) was designed in 1920; its stark, functional lines are typical of the artistic trend 'Neue Sachlichkeit' (New Objectivity)\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek state library, rebuilt in 1970.\nFriedrichsbau Variet\u00e9 (Friedrich Building), rebuilt in 1994 on the site of the former art nouveau building\n\n\n=== Architecture in other districts ===\n\nA number of significant castles stand in Stuttgart's suburbs and beyond as reminders of the city's royal past. These include:\n\nCastle Solitude, 1700\u20131800. Baroque/Rococo)\nLudwigsburg Palace, 1704\u20131758. Baroque, with its enormous baroque garden.\nCastle Hohenheim, 1771\u20131793Other landmarks in and around Stuttgart include (see also museums below):\n\nCastle Rosenstein (1822\u20131830) Classical\nW\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum (1824) which holds the remains of Catherine Pavlovna of Russia and King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg\nWilhelma Zoo and Botanical Gardens (1853)\nThe Observation Tower of Burgholzhof an 1891 brick observation tower constructed by the Cannstatt municipal architect Friedrich Keppler on behalf of the Versch\u00f6nerungsverein Cannstatt e. V. (\"Society for the Beautification of Cannstatt\"), in the style of a Roman tower.\nWeissenhof Estate (1927), (International Style)\nThe TV Tower (1950), the world's first concrete TV tower\nStuttgart Airport Terminal Building, 2000. In neighboring Leinfelden-Echterdingen\n\n\n=== Parks, lakes, cemeteries and other places of interest ===\n \nAt the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists. Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden.

The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices.

Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond.

It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy W\u00fcrttemberg until 1806, the W\u00fcrttemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen W\u00fcrttemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart.

The first is the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (also called the CityTour Stuttgart), lasting from 10 AM to 4 PM that takes visitors around the city. The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Some of its most prominent companies include Daimler AG, Porsche, Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sika \u2013 all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.\nStuttgart is home to Germany's ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nThe city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg after Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and Freiburg.

Friedrich Schiller and the city's most famous Classicist architect, Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, were among its many esteemed alumni.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nThe first Waldorf School (also known as Rudolf Steiner School) was founded here in 1919 by the director of the Waldorf Astoria tobacco factory, Emil Molt, and Austrian social thinker Rudolf Steiner, a comprehensive school following Steiner's educational principles of anthroposophy and humanistic ideals. Today, four of these schools are located in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== International School ===\nSince 1985 Stuttgart is home to the International School of Stuttgart, one of fewer than 100 schools worldwide that offer all three International Baccalaureate programs- the IB Primary Years (Early Learning to Grade 5), IB Middle Years (Grade 6 to 10), IB Diploma (grades 11\u201312). The International School of Stuttgart is accredited by both the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.\n\n\n== Media and publishing ==\nOne of the headquarters of the public S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR; Southwest Broadcasting) channels (several radio and one TV channel; regional focus on the southwestern German States of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate) is located in Stuttgart (the other ones being Baden-Baden and Mainz).

It transmits on FM on 102.3 MHz from Fernmeldeturm Frauenkopf and on AM on 1143 kHz from Hirschlanden transmitter.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFollowing the suit of other German cities such as Berlin, Cologne and Hanover, on 1 March 2008 a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) came into effect in Stuttgart with the aim of improving air quality. This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (Umweltzone), including vehicles from abroad.\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\n\nStuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a 'U' symbol, which stands for Untergrundbahn (underground rail). Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfenbahnen AG (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the Stuttgart S-Bahn, using tracks supplied by the national Deutsche Bahn AG (DB).\nA peculiarity of Stuttgart is the Zahnradbahn, a rack railway that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch. It is the only urban rack railway in Germany. Stuttgart also has a Standseilbahn, a funicular railway that operates in the Heslach area and the forest cemetery (Waldfriedhof). In Killesberg Park, on a prominent hill overlooking the city, there is the miniature railway run by diesel (and on weekends with steam).\n\n\n=== Rail links ===\n\nStuttgart is a hub in the Intercity-Express and Intercity networks of Deutsche Bahn AG (DB), with through services to most other major German cities. It also operates international services to Strasbourg, Vienna, Z\u00fcrich and Paris (five times a day, journey time 3 hours 11 minutes).Long-distance trains stop at Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, the city's main line terminus, which is also used by Interregio-Express, Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains for services to stations in the Stuttgart metropolitan area. The local rail networks (see above) operate underneath the terminus.Stuttgart also has its own rail freight centre with marshalling yards and a container terminal in the Obert\u00fcrkheim area of Hedelfingen.\n\n\n=== Rail: The Stuttgart 21 project ===\nAfter years of political debate and controversy, plans were approved in October 2007 to convert the existing above-ground main train station to an underground through station. The Stuttgart 21 project will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart's enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and should be completed in 2020.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Stuttgart Airport (German: Flughafen Stuttgart, IATA airport code STR), an international airport approximately 13 km (8 mi) south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns. It takes 30 minutes to reach the airport from the city center using S-Bahn lines S2 or S3. Stuttgart airport is Germany's only international airport with one runway. Despite protests and local initiatives, surveys are currently underway to assess the impact of a second runway.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Autobahn A8, that runs east\u2013west from Karlsruhe to Munich, and Autobahn A81 that runs north\u2013south from W\u00fcrzburg to Singen. The Autobahn A831 is a short spur entering the southern side of Stuttgart.\n\nBesides these Autobahns, Stuttgart is served by a large number of expressways, many of which are built to Autobahn standards, and were once intended to carry an A-number. Important expressways like B10, B14, B27 and B29 connect Stuttgart with its suburbs. Due to the hilly surroundings, there are many road tunnels in and around Stuttgart. There are also a number of road tunnels under intersections in the center of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\nStuttgart has an inland port in Hedelfingen on the Neckar.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nAs in the rest of Germany, football is the most popular sport in Stuttgart which is home to 'The Reds' and 'The Blues'.

          "A large collection of paintings and sculptures - among which there are certainly several great masterpieces - even for ordinary art lovers. But not only that. The Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, by architect James Stirling, is a masterpiece of postmodern architecture all over",
          "I only toured the permanent collection and found it contained works from many big names including Picasso, Dali, and Warhol. However, the museum is very dated and dingy. It definitely needs an interior facelift.",
          "I really didn't expect I would enjoy this gallery so much. I thought the Gallery of Modern Art would be better, because its building is so remarkably beautiful, but it turned to be just the opposite. I spent over 2.5 hours inside and didn't get bored even for a second.",
          "In one gallery, I've never dreamed of seeing so many masterpieces. This was by far my best art gallery experience.",
          "I had not been here since 1985 when the gallery opened and what a treat to revisit this amazing collection, particularly 19th and 20th century. The Burns-Jones room is unbelievable as is the Picasso room and I could go on and on. Very special. As was the Bauhaus collection of",
          "They have a comprehensive collection of modern art, including Banksy's famous \"Girl with the Red Balloon\" in its half shredded glory. Seven Euro admission fee, and no talking!",
          "Don\u2019t miss out. Not only can you get a close up view of Bansky\u2019s Lobe in the bin but many more wonderful pieces of art.",
          "So I live in Stuttgart since a couple months and I finally decided to visit the Staatsgalarie. I was pleasantly surprised that they have quite some breadth in all their areas. They have at least one of most big names across ages. If you already went to places like Musee d'Orsay",
          "I make it a point to visit art galleries when I travel. I have some particular interests, such as Pre-Raphaelite paintings and I was so pleasantly surprised when I visited here and found their wonderful Burne-Jones paintings! Also some of my other favorite artists such as",

          "I do not know much about art but I enjoyed wandering through the museum. It was well laid out and in each room there was a description of the type of art or period of art that it was displaying which was in both German and English. This really helped to understand what I was",

          "This museum is a real indulgence with a stunning array of beautiful artworks from professional artists. Paintings, drawings & photographs make it the most visited & well-known museum in Stuttgart, & one of the most popular in Germany. In more than 12,000 square metres of",
          "Near the central Station, nice museum, you can leave your jacket at the cloackroom near the cashier. Not too much visitor. Different styles : modern art, impressionnisme... Around 2 h visit",
          "For me - something of a 'must see'. The have a lot of exhibition floor space and a huge range of art/installations. Inevitably, some of the works left me asking is this art or just pretentious drivel? The place has everything from Grand Masters to the proverbial pile of",
          "First experience was nice exhibition on sculptor Lehmbruck, with on show many studies for his 'keyworks', including drawings and etchings, body parts in 'Steinguss'(sort of concrete), this is proper tribute to this great sculptor (1881-1919). Then, based upon research through",

          "The building looks spacious from the outside, but we really had no idea just how much it had inside. What a treasure trove! Walking around the galleries felt like an education in the history of European art. It's worth planning as much time as you can in your schedule and taking",
          "My wife and I have had the privilege to see a lot of Art Galleries in our travels, but this one is just outstanding. The overall collection of art from across the centuries is enough to keep you and your mind occupied for hours. Go and enjoy!",
          "The museum was very rich and had a great flow between different art styles. The descriptions were interesting to read and informative. Superb expressionism collection!",
          "Why have I never heard of this place before??? I was staying across the street and had an open morning so I decided to stop in this Art Museum. I spent 3 hours in the Modern Art section alone (early 20th century to present), and there are several other wings of the building I",
          "A must for the city of Stuttgart. A variety of paintings and sculptures of the main european and american artists.",
          "This museum and its collection rivals the greatest museums in the world! Just stunned by the range and depth of the collection. Give yourself a FULL DAY (maybe even two!!)! Skip everything else in Stuttgart to give yourself the time for this museum. From the Middle Ages",
          "This museum was very well layed out. The only spoiling part is the security manager who is extremely unfriendly. Luckily I was able to file a complaint for the way the manager behaved.",

          "The collection of paintings and art is quite beautiful. But all other things like too many security watching every single step and movement doesn\u2019t allow to enjoy the exhibition. The white line on the floor is not so visible and you don\u2019t expect the securities shouting on you \u201c",

          "This place is magnificent. Munch, Picaso, Salvidor Dali, Max Beckhmann, George Grosz, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Edward Burne-Jones, Monet, Paul Gauguin, Renoir, Cezanne to name a few. I was blown away, of course where I come from these are just names you read about and see",
          "Very beautiful collection of art and a nice balance between older and modern pieces. The building is not designed in the most practical way and I didn't particularly like some of the spaces the art was shown in. However, if you're in Stuttgart and you like art this is a",
          "This art gallery is certainly worth a visit. We enjoyed our time here and particularly enjoyed the \"uncluttered\" feel of the gallery. It is very spread out between the new and old gallery which we found difficult to navigate, but managed to retrace our steps and find the Monet",
          "I had visited this interesting gallery in the morning before leaving the town in early afternoon. The place isn't too large where you can finish seeing through all paintings and sculptures within 2 - 4 hours (depending on how long you want to spend). Most collections in this",
          "I think it was worth it, and you even get a discount with Stuttgart card... I\u2019m sorry we havent take a single picture",
          "It's free admission at the moment. I enjoyed my visit very much. People seem obsessed with the building itself but the collection of art is outstanding. Paintings are well displayed and categorized and it's very much a case of quality over quantity. Highly recommended.",
          "This has to be one of the most confusing museums for new guests! I understood that the original building had an addition many years ago to combine the modern new building with old, but signage doesn\u2019t provide easy directions on how to get around. You go upstairs to go",
          "An associate was delayed on day at Stuttgart. No problem. Spent the day at the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart (the State Gallery) which is home to one of the finest art collections in Germany. Also and one of the country's most visited museums. Best known for its superlative collection",

          "Don't miss it! It's a beautiful museum with full of paintings and sculptures of great artist through ages! It's really big and a little complicated. Don't forget to ask for the map.",
          "Sundays in Germany can be a challenge, the shops are shut and so are most places of entertainment, restaurants are mostly closed except for some cafes and gelaterias. If you find yourself in a city at lose ends like we did on a Sunday the first place to look to eat the hours is",
          "Do not miss this museum when visiting Stuttgart!!! I would categorize this museum among the top 3 attractions in the city. The collection is absolutely amazing. A solid survey of German and European art from the 13th century to the present (they have a few American artists",
          "I found it a little tricky to understand how this gallery was organised to begin with, and I was also shunted to the French impressionists for some reason. Study the plan and make sure you start where you want. There's an excellent range of 20th century modern art: Picasso,",
          "If you want to enjoy modern art, rather than old masters, go directly to the second floor and start the tour from there. There is a lot of to see there, the exhibition contains master pieces and it's nicely arranged. Enough space for the art and people.",
          "We went on a Wednesday as we had read the gallery was free that day. We had a very helpful woman who let us know that we could also see the special exhibition for free (which normally costs extra) after 5:30 for the last 30 minutes the gallery is open. So our late visit worked",
          "I found this gallery very boring and spent less than an hour here. The saving grace was that my hotel had offered complimentary tickets so it wasn't a case of lost money.",

          "I was pleasantly surprised by the impressive collections here! We were limited on time but managed to see most rooms in 75 minutes. All descriptive captions were written in German and English. There was a coatcheck, gift shop, and caf\u00e9. Tickets were reasonably priced (\u20ac7 per",
          "Did not expect the amount of famous master pieces. Was really a worthwhile Wednesday afternoon and I was lucky enough to be able to see the private exhibition (\u20ac12) that was shoeing, wow! As an artist myself I walked away feeling inspired for my next \"master piece\"! I would",

          "The annoying exterior aside, this is one of Germany's great art museums, and once inside, the galleries are spacious and refreshing. Plan on a half-day to see everything, including special exhibitions which are of high quality (I was lucky enough to be there while Julian",
          "It is absolutely fantastic. There is a room full of Picasso but there are other great, very famous masters. There are rooms and rooms full of medieval art from the region. Huge Altars with intricate design. I believe it is free to go on Wednesday to the General Exhibition but",

          "If you visit Stuttgart and you are interested in art, it's really recommended to visit the Staatsgalerie.",

          "We went for a small show of impressionists and to see the collection of 20th century art, all were from the permanent collection. It was impressive and the explanations in each room were very good, giving context the the groupings and exposure ot lesser known artists along side",
          "The permanent exhibit is a must! The largest collection of Picasso in Germany, work by all the major masters of contemporary and modern art. A good exhibition for Francis Bacon. All very well done, and in English!",

          "it is not the best museum and it is under reconstruction at the moment but I enjoyed the permanent exhibition and francis Bacon exhibition is very good -so enjoy (if you like this kind of modern art)",
          "Our favorite museum in Stuttgart. Huge but manageable in 2-3 hours collection of mostly European art. The curator has been somewhat playful with the design of the collections placement so for instance you can be in a section of old masters and turn the corner and find a room",
          "I went to the Staatsgalerie on a rainy day last weekend. I'm not much of an art enthusiast but I certainly can be very impressed by great collections. I wasn't impressed by what I saw in this museum. Additionally, I feel that the organization of the museum was confusing.",
          "My artist friend used to always say \"What is your vision.\" I can say this gallery tries but does not quiet get there. A mix of this and that and its all okay. No competition to the great museums of the world, but it is adequate for the city size. After you visit you will see",
          "Galleries share late night openings, and every 6 months or so there is the Long Night At The Museums, wherein all the museums, galleries, and even a mineral spa, stay open late. Public transit offers deals to get you around. Back to this galley, they have interesting",
          "I am really sorry to say but it was quite confusing to find the entrance of the building! Otherwise the experience was wonderful and I would highly recommend it to all lovers of art.",

          "I think its the best one place in stuttgart...you will not waste your time visiting this place!!!my opinion is that its better to spent at least 3 hours.",
          "This is located centrally and easy to visit but it is not a beautiful building and the collection is very avaerage especially by European standards. Stuttgart is a city of technology and cars and not so much about art.",
          "Great art collection, old and moderm. It was not crowded, when we visited it on sunday morning. Nice Cafe/restaurant inside.Don't miss it, when you are in Stuttgart.",
          "Surprisingly few visitors when we were there (I am not complaining!) There are 2 main collections of which I rate the 20th Century Collection highly.",
          "This holds a large collection of art from the 13th century to the present day. Starting chronologically and locally with German painting in the ground floor of the original building. There are some original Swabian altar pieces in this section. Flemish and Dutch painting also",
          "Great collection, convenient location by train. Not very crowded on a Sunday afternoon. Attached to a bistro with a small but nice menu.",
          "This gallery was totally worth the 8 euros it cost to get in! If nothing else, just seeing the Salvador Dal\u00ed and Andy Warhols made my visit worth it. I saw the Warhol/ Banksy exhibit in Amsterdam, but this had different Warhols (three I think?) that were pretty fantastic. Do be",
          "I hate to give Stuttgart's Staatsgalerie a 3-star review. I had wanted it to be so much better than it is. I agree with the recent reviewer who rated the older art 3 stars. It's really more for specialists than for a general public. As to the modern art, I'd give it, too, 3",
          "The State Gallery is my favourite museum in Stuttgart, I love everything about, even before I enter the building, the architecture of the building is worth looking at. They have a great gift shop. Located in Konrad-Adenauer-road, you are close to several other Museums (house of",

Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:\n\nThe Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534. Exterior: Romanesque/Gothic; interior: Romanesque/Gothic/Modern. Reconstructed with simplified interior after World War II.\nAltes Schloss (the Old Castle), mostly dating from the late 15th century, some parts date back to 1320.

In neighboring Leinfelden-Echterdingen\n\n\n=== Parks, lakes, cemeteries and other places of interest ===\n \nAt the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists. Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.\nOther parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandsh\u00f6he hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Wei\u00dfenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at 511 metres (1,677 ft) the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300\u2013400 years old).\n\nThere are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium. Established in 1873 it was extended to include Jewish graves in 1874 and also now houses the Russian Orthodox Church of Alexander Nevsky\nThe Uff-Kirchhof cemetery in Bad Cannstatt which stands at the crossroads of two ancient Roman roads and Cannstatter Hauptfriedhof, the largest graveyard in Stuttgart which has been used as a Muslim burial ground since 1985.The city boasts the largest mineral water deposits in Europe after Budapest, with over 250 springs within the urban area.\n\n\n=== Culture and events ===\n\nStuttgart is known for its rich cultural heritage, in particular its State Theatre (Staatstheater) and State Gallery (Staatsgalerie). The Staatstheater is home to the State opera and three smaller theatres. It regularly stages opera, ballet and theatre productions as well as concerts. The Staatstheater was named Germany/Austria/Switzerland \"Theatre of the year\" in 2006; the Stuttgart Opera has won the 'Opera of the year' award six times. Stuttgart Ballet is connected to names like John Cranko and Marcia Hayd\u00e9e.\nStuttgart is also home to one of Germany's most prestigious symphony orchestras, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra, with famous English conductor Sir Roger Norrington, who developed a distinct sound of that orchestra, known as the Stuttgart Sound. They mostly perform in the Liederhalle concert hall.\nThe city offers two Broadway-style musical theaters, the Apollo and the Palladium Theater (each approx. 1800 seats). Ludwigsburg Palace in the nearby town of Ludwigsburg is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.\nAs a result of Stuttgart's long history of viticulture (Even today there are vineyards less than 500 m (1,640 ft) from the Main Station), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the \"St\u00e4ffele\") around the city, equivalent to approximately 20 km (12 mi) of steps. Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond. For example, Gaisburger Marsch is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart's Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.\n\nIn October 2009 the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced that the European Union was to officially recognise the pasta dish Maultaschen as a \"regional specialty\", thus marking its significance to the cultural heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.In 1993 Stuttgart hosted the International Garden Show in the suburb of Killesberg. In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the Football World Cup. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. In 2008 it was host to the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships. In 2015 Stuttgart hosted the Protestant Kirchentag (Chuchfestival)\nRegular events that take place in Stuttgart:\n\nThe world-famous annual 'Volksfest', originally a traditional agricultural fair which now also hosts beer tents and a French village and is second in size only to the Oktoberfest in Munich. There is also a Spring festival on the same grounds in April of each year.\nWith more than 3.6 million visitors in 2007 and more than 200 stands, Stuttgart's Christmas Market, running from late November to 23 December, is the largest and one of the oldest traditional Christmas markets in Europe. It is especially renowned for its abundant decorations and takes place in the four weeks leading up to Christmas.\nThe Fish Market (Hamburger Fischmarkt, late July) with fresh fish, other food and beer from Hamburg.\nThe Summer Festival (Stuttgart Sommerfest, usually in early August) with shows, music, children's entertainment and local cuisine in Schlossplatz, Stuttgart and adjacent parks\nThe Lantern Festival (Lichterfest, early July) in Killesberg park with its famous firework display and fairground attractions\nThe Wine Village (Weindorf, late August/early September) \u2013 vintages are sold at this event held at Schillerplatz and Marktplatz (Market Square)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nStuttgart is home to five of the eleven state museums in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The foremost of these is the Old State Gallery (opened in 1843, extended in 1984) which holds art dating from the 14th to 19th century including works by Rubens, Rembrandt, Monet, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne and Beuys. Next door to the Old State Gallery is the New State Gallery (1980) with its controversial modern architecture. Among others, this gallery houses works from Max Beckmann, Dal\u00ed, Matisse, Mir\u00f3, Picasso, Klee, Chagall and Kandinsky.\nThe Old Castle is also home to the State Museum of W\u00fcrttemberg which was founded in 1862 by William I of W\u00fcrttemberg. The museum traces the rich history of W\u00fcrttemberg with many artifacts from its dukes, counts and kings, as well as earlier remnants dating back to the Stone Age. On the Karlsplatz side of the Old Castle is a museum dedicated to the memory of Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, former resident of Stuttgart who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944.\n\nOther leading museums in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe History Museum (Haus der Geschichte, 1987), examining local history, finds, the conflict between modern society and its cultural history\nState Museum of Natural History Stuttgart (SMNS) in Park Rosenstein housed in Castle Rosenstein (with an emphasis on biology and natural history) and L\u00f6wentor Museum (paleontology and geology, home of the Steinheim skull and many unique fossils from the triassic, jurassic and tertiary periods)\nThe Mercedes-Benz Museum (1936, moved in 2006), now the most visited museum in Stuttgart (440,000 visits per year).

The Stuttgart-based Pentecostal Gospel Forum is the largest place of worship (megachurch) in Germany. It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy W\u00fcrttemberg until 1806, the W\u00fcrttemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen W\u00fcrttemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart. The archived material is in principle open to the public and can be consulted in the reading room in Bellingweg 21 in Bad Cannstatt.\nThe Landeskirchliche Archives preserve the stocks of the W\u00fcrttemberg church leaders and of other ecclesial bodies and institutions: the ducal and royal W\u00fcrttemberg consistory, the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, deanery and parish archives, educational institutions, the works and associations as well as estates and collections. It also has the microfilms of all church books (especially baptism, marriage, and family Death's Register) in the area of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe \"Archive instigator\" is dedicated to the dead of the city. Since 2005, the instigators are working on a memoir about \"The dead town\". So far, about 5,000 names of victims of the regime of National Socialism have been acquired.\nThere are two large tours that are available to visitors to Stuttgart. The first is the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (also called the CityTour Stuttgart), lasting from 10 AM to 4 PM that takes visitors around the city. The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Some of its most prominent companies include Daimler AG, Porsche, Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sika \u2013 all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.\nStuttgart is home to Germany's ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nThe city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg after Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and Freiburg. Founded in 1829, it was a Technische Hochschule (\"Technical University\") until 1967, when it was renamed to \"university\". Its campus for social sciences and architecture is located in the city centre, near the main train station, while the natural science campus is in the southwestern city district of Vaihingen. Historically, it has been especially renowned for its faculty of architecture (Stuttgarter Schule). Today, its main focus is on engineering and other technical subjects.\nUniversity of Hohenheim, founded in 1818 as an academy for agricultural science and forestry. While these subjects are still taught there today, its other focus today is on business administration. It is located in Hohenheim quarter of the southern city district of Plieningen.\nState University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart, founded in 1857, located in the city center, next to the Neue Staatsgalerie.\nState Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart, one of the biggest art colleges in Germany, founded in 1761, located in the Killesberg quarter of the northern city district Stuttgart-Nord.\nStuttgart Media University (Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart), founded in 2001 as a university of applied sciences, a merger of the former College of Printing and Publishing and the College of Librarianship, located in Vaihingen.\nStuttgart Technology University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule f\u00fcr Technik Stuttgart), founded in 1832 as a college for craftsmanship, university of applied sciences since 1971, located in the city center, near the University of Stuttgart's city-center campus.\nUniversity of Cooperative Education Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, founded in 1974, with a focus on practical experience, subjects are business, technology and social work.Historically, an elite military academy existed in Stuttgart in the late 18th century (1770\u20131794), the Hohe Karlsschule, at Solitude Castle. Friedrich Schiller and the city's most famous Classicist architect, Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, were among its many esteemed alumni.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nThe first Waldorf School (also known as Rudolf Steiner School) was founded here in 1919 by the director of the Waldorf Astoria tobacco factory, Emil Molt, and Austrian social thinker Rudolf Steiner, a comprehensive school following Steiner's educational principles of anthroposophy and humanistic ideals. Today, four of these schools are located in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== International School ===\nSince 1985 Stuttgart is home to the International School of Stuttgart, one of fewer than 100 schools worldwide that offer all three International Baccalaureate programs- the IB Primary Years (Early Learning to Grade 5), IB Middle Years (Grade 6 to 10), IB Diploma (grades 11\u201312). The International School of Stuttgart is accredited by both the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.\n\n\n== Media and publishing ==\nOne of the headquarters of the public S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR; Southwest Broadcasting) channels (several radio and one TV channel; regional focus on the southwestern German States of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate) is located in Stuttgart (the other ones being Baden-Baden and Mainz). It also has a Landesmedienzentrum, a State media center.\nFurthermore, the city is a significant centre of publishing and specialist printing, with renowned houses such as Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, Ernst Klett Verlag (schoolbooks), Kohlhammer Verlag, Metzler Verlag and Motor Presse having their head offices there. The Reclam Verlag is located in nearby Ditzingen.\nThe newspapers Stuttgarter Zeitung (StZ; regional, with significant supra-regional, national and international sections) and Stuttgarter Nachrichten (StN; regional) are published here as well as a number of smaller, local papers such as Cannstatter Zeitung.\nAs is the case wherever the US military is stationed, there is an American Forces Network (AFN) station. It transmits on FM on 102.3 MHz from Fernmeldeturm Frauenkopf and on AM on 1143 kHz from Hirschlanden transmitter.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFollowing the suit of other German cities such as Berlin, Cologne and Hanover, on 1 March 2008 a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) came into effect in Stuttgart with the aim of improving air quality. This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (Umweltzone), including vehicles from abroad.\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\n\nStuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a 'U' symbol, which stands for Untergrundbahn (underground rail). Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfenbahnen AG (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the Stuttgart S-Bahn, using tracks supplied by the national Deutsche Bahn AG (DB).\nA peculiarity of Stuttgart is the Zahnradbahn, a rack railway that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch. It is the only urban rack railway in Germany. Stuttgart also has a Standseilbahn, a funicular railway that operates in the Heslach area and the forest cemetery (Waldfriedhof). In Killesberg Park, on a prominent hill overlooking the city, there is the miniature railway run by diesel (and on weekends with steam).\n\n\n=== Rail links ===\n\nStuttgart is a hub in the Intercity-Express and Intercity networks of Deutsche Bahn AG (DB), with through services to most other major German cities. It also operates international services to Strasbourg, Vienna, Z\u00fcrich and Paris (five times a day, journey time 3 hours 11 minutes).Long-distance trains stop at Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, the city's main line terminus, which is also used by Interregio-Express, Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains for services to stations in the Stuttgart metropolitan area. The local rail networks (see above) operate underneath the terminus.Stuttgart also has its own rail freight centre with marshalling yards and a container terminal in the Obert\u00fcrkheim area of Hedelfingen.\n\n\n=== Rail: The Stuttgart 21 project ===\nAfter years of political debate and controversy, plans were approved in October 2007 to convert the existing above-ground main train station to an underground through station. The Stuttgart 21 project will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart's enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and should be completed in 2020.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Stuttgart Airport (German: Flughafen Stuttgart, IATA airport code STR), an international airport approximately 13 km (8 mi) south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns. It takes 30 minutes to reach the airport from the city center using S-Bahn lines S2 or S3. Stuttgart airport is Germany's only international airport with one runway. Despite protests and local initiatives, surveys are currently underway to assess the impact of a second runway.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Autobahn A8, that runs east\u2013west from Karlsruhe to Munich, and Autobahn A81 that runs north\u2013south from W\u00fcrzburg to Singen. The Autobahn A831 is a short spur entering the southern side of Stuttgart.\n\nBesides these Autobahns, Stuttgart is served by a large number of expressways, many of which are built to Autobahn standards, and were once intended to carry an A-number. Important expressways like B10, B14, B27 and B29 connect Stuttgart with its suburbs. Due to the hilly surroundings, there are many road tunnels in and around Stuttgart. There are also a number of road tunnels under intersections in the center of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\nStuttgart has an inland port in Hedelfingen on the Neckar.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nAs in the rest of Germany, football is the most popular sport in Stuttgart which is home to 'The Reds' and 'The Blues'.

        "wiki": "The Killesbergpark (H\u00f6henpark Killesberg) is an urban public park of half a square kilometre (123 acres) in Stuttgart, Germany. It is just north of the state capital, where Killesberg is a quarter of the borough of Stuttgart-Nord (North).\nThe park dates back to the horticultural show of 1939. Before the show, a large area of the park had been a quarry. It was transformed into a park with exhibition sites for the show, and has remained, hosting horticultural events on a regular basis, including the \u201cBundesgartenschau\u201d and the IGA (Internationale Gartenbauausstellung), both garden festivals.\nThe Killesbergpark bordered for many years the city's fairgrounds. In 2007, Messe Stuttgart moved to new ground close to Stuttgart Airport. \nEvery July the park hosts the popular Lichterfest Stuttgart. Thousands of lanterns are placed around the park, decorating the park for a variety of family activities throughout.  After dark, there is a fireworks show accompanied by music. Visitors often bring blankets to sit on for the show.\n\n\n== Killesberg railway ==\nSince its opening, the park has been home to the 381-millimetre (15-inch) narrow-gauge Killesberg railway. In the summer months, visitors can see two diesel and two steam locomotives, which have been fixtures in the park since 1950. The horticultural show of 1939 saw the opening of the railway, when two borrowed steam engines from Leipzig traversed a short stretch of track. During World War II, the steam engines were returned to Leipzig for use there. New locomotives were purchased, and today there are two diesel and three steam engines in use.\n\n\n== Killesberg tower ==\nCompleted in 2001 the Killesberg Tower is a 40m high observation tower, overlooking the park. It was designed by J\u00f6rg Schlaich, using cable-stayed bridge technology.\n\n\n== Other features ==\nFrom the 1950s until the 1980s there was a chair lift for visitors to enjoy views of the fairgrounds and parklands.\nThe twenty-metre high Bismarck tower stands one kilometre south-west of the exhibition halls. It was built on the Gaehkopf, the highest point in northern Stuttgart, giving good views of Stuttgart itself and in all directions. It was one of many towers built to commemorate Otto von Bismarck. The building of over 410 Bismarck towers worldwide was planned, and 238 were actually built. The building of the tower was begun in 1902 by the students of the technical university in Stuttgart. The Stuttgart Bismarck tower was opened on 16 July 1904. In 2004, for its 100th anniversary, it was comprehensively renovated.\n\n\n== Surroundings ==\nNear the Bismarck tower is the Theodor Heuss house, the house of the first German Federal President, which has been converted into a museum.\nAn open-air swimming pool borders the fairground buildings to the north.\nTo the southwest lies the Weissenhof Settlement of 1927, a protected monument, exhibiting \"the dwelling\" as initiated by the German work federation.\nThe American scholar and writer Richard J. Powers lives in the area.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStuttgart.de\nDie Parkeisenbahn von 1939\nKillesberg Tower\nAussichtsturm Killesberg: Technische Daten\nLichterfest-Stuttgart",

      "name": "New Palace",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The New Palace (German: Neues Schloss) is an 18th-century Baroque palace and is one of the last large city palaces built in Southern Germany. The palace is located in the center of Stuttgart on the Schlossplatz in front of the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule column and K\u00f6nigsbau. Public tours of the building are only permitted by special arrangement, as the building contains some government offices. Once a historic residence of the Kings of W\u00fcrttemberg, the New Palace derives its name from its commissioning by Duke Carl Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg to replace the Old Castle in the early years of his reign. Originally, Charles commissioned Nikolaus Friedrich Thouret, but architects Leopold Retti, Philippe da la Guepi\u00e8re, Reinhard Heinrich Ferdinand Fischer would contribute to the design, history, and construction of the palace.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nIn 1737, then Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg Charles Alexander died leaving his nine year old Charles Eugene as Duke prematurely. He was not yet old enough to rule the Duchy, so he was sent to be educated and study in the court of then King of Prussia Frederick the Great while the court of W\u00fcrttemberg was run by magistrates. In 1744, Charles Eugene came of age at 16 years of age, and returned to Stuttgart to assume his throne. Upon arriving, he desired a new residence proper residence which is convenable to his royal dignity and the amplitude of his royal household\" in the city of Stuttgart and even threatened to move the capital back out of Stuttgart to Ludwigsburg Palace. The W\u00fcrttemberg Diet, who had lost the traditional role of capital of the Duchy for decades to the smaller and unfortified Ludwigsburg, insisted that the palace and seat of the power be moved back into Stuttgart because it would mean increased pride and political and economic power coming to rest in the city once again. So it was that Charles Eugene decided to build his palace upon the Schlossplatz.However, there was some debate over the palace as the Duchy already had the large and expensive residence at Ludwigsburg, and some, like W\u00fcrttemberg's Oberbaudirektor Johann Christoph David Leger, argued that expansion of a previous residence like the Old Castle would suffice. Plans nonetheless went forward, and architects across Europe jumped at the chance to design the Duke's palace and submitted drafts directly to Charles, including  renowned architects Alessandro Galli da Bibiena and Maurizio Pedetti as well as Balthasar Neumann, designer of the world-famous W\u00fcrzburg Residence.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nOn 3 September 1746 the cornerstone was laid under the New Palace's first build master, Leopoldo Matteo Retti whose uncle, Donato Giuseppe Frisoni, had worked on Ludwigsburg Palace. Retti, who picked the site of an old crossbow shop for the New Palace, planned for the courtyard to face the nearby Karlsschule Stuttgart and New Lusthaus south of the palace, the Garden Wing to face the Ducal Apartments in the Corps de logis, and for the City Wing to contain the guest and state rooms. However, when construction began, it began under the direction of Johann Christoph David Leger as Retti was working on a commission in Ansbach until 1748. The following year, the facades of the Corps de logis and Garden Wing were completed, while work on the interiors would last until 1750. Unfortunately, Retti, whose work had been inspired by the Baroque architecture of France, died of an unknown illness 18 September 1751.\nAfter Retti's death, construction of the palace fell to Parisian architect Philippe de La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re, a friend of Retti. A connoisseur of then modern architectural theory, Philippe was inspired by his time in his native France and especially the magnificent Palace of Versailles, and took the palace in this direction. Under La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re, the City Wing facade was finished in 1756 as well as a dome over the central structure in 1760 with decorations to the Corp de logis following in 1762. Unfortunately, a fire destroyed the interior of the Garden Wing, which La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re had just finished, on the night of 13\u201314 November of that same year. Following the fire, an annoyed Charles Eugene decreed the speedy conclusion of construction of the White Room and Mirror Gallery for the celebration of his birthday (11 February) the following year. In 1764, construction ceased because the Duke moved his residence to Ludwigsburg and remained there for a decade. In response, La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re left the Duke's court in 1768 and returned to Paris.In 1775, the Duke returned to Stuttgart and hired Reinhard Heinrich Ferdinand Fischer to repair the Palace. He would do so until his death in 1793 and his era would see the central pavilion of the Marble Hall in the Corps de Logis was decorated with a fresco by Nicolas Guibal. Czar Paul I of Russia and his wife Sophie Dorothea of W\u00fcrttemberg, one of Charles Eugene's nieces, visited the castle in 1775.\nWhen Charles Eugene died in 1793, New Palace was given more much needed repairs. 1789 saw the completion of the City Wing and the Garden Wing in 1791 during the rule of Frederick II Eugene, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg (construction elsewhere could continue into the 19th Century). In 1806, as the palace was finally nearing completion, Napoleon Bonaparte visited the New Palace. Eleven years later, von Thouret redecorated some of the rooms of the Red Marble Hall during the visit of Czar Alexander I.When Duke and then King Frederick I died, William I moved the seat of his power back to the New Palace and hired Giovanni Salucci and later his pupil Ferdinand Gabriel and charged them with renovating the palace's Grey and Yellow Marble Halls in 1836. In 1840 and 1841 and from 1852 to 1854, the court painter Josef Anton Gegenbauer painted three frescoes in the rooms created next to the staircase on the ground floor with scenes from the history of the Duchy and the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg. Under Duke Charles I and his wife Olga only minor changes were made to the castle, mainly made in the royal living area and by Joseph von Egle were executed. William II renounced the residency of the Dukes in the New Palace, and the palace was somewhat opened to the public for the first time.\n\n\n=== Use after 1918 ===\nAfter Wilhelm II of W\u00fcrttemberg abdicated his throne on November 30, 1918, the palace passed into state ownership. In 1919, the German Foreign Institute used the ground floor and some of the garden wing to house their offices and showrooms and some of the first and second floors became the headquarters for the local police. In the early 1920s, nearly the entire first floor became a museum displaying the royal Kunstkammer, majolica collection, and former living places of the kings of W\u00fcrttemberg. On 15 April 1920, Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker, future President of Germany, was born in the attic of the palace. When the German Foreign Institute moved out in 1928, the remaining unused portions of the palace were converted into German military and ancient antiquity museums. When the police headquarters moved out in 1926, the second floor housed the offices of the antiquities collection and historic preservation authorities.In the World War II air raids on February 21, 1944, Neue Schloss was almost completely burned to the ground by Allied bombs, leaving only the facade standing. For many years, preservationists fought to rebuild Neue Schloss (once, it was nearly demolished in favor of a hotel) until 1957 when finally it was agreed in the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Landtag that the castle would be rebuilt - by one vote. Since the reconstruction that began in 1958 under the careful direction of Horst Linde, the castle has been used by the State's government, starting with the Corps de logis (Now used for representation by the State Ministry) and the two wings of the castle. The only part of the castle that was not fully restored was an air raid shelter under the building that was demolished in 1958. Today it is used by the State Ministries of Finance and Education and is now open to the public via regular guided tours.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Baroque residences\nLudwigsburg Palace\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in German) Neus Schloss Stuttgart (Staatliche Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg)\n(in English) Neues Schloss (New Castle) (Region Stuttgart)\n(in German) New Castle Stuttgart (Schl\u00f6sser & Burgen in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg)",

        "wiki": "Schillerplatz is a square in the old city centre of Stuttgart, Germany named in honour of the German poet, philosopher, historian, and dramatist Friedrich Schiller. Schillerplatz stands to the south west of Stuttgart's main square, Schlossplatz.\n\n\n== Buildings around Schillerplatz ==\n\nStarting in the south west corner, Schillerplatz is surrounded by the Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), the Fruchtkasten building, the Prinzenbau (which now houses the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Ministry of Justice, the Alte Kanzlei (Old Chancellery) and Altes Schloss (the Old Castle).\nA street market takes place twice a week on Schillerplatz. The square is also used for major events taking place on Marktplatz (Stuttgart's Market Square) such as the annual Christmas Market. Hidden underneath Schillerplatz's cobblestones is an underground car park.\nThe late Gothic Fruchtkasten building in the corner of Schillerplatz is now used by the State Museum of W\u00fcrttemberg to house a collection of musical instruments.\n\n\n== The Schiller memorial ==\nAt the centre of the cobblestone square is a memorial to Friedrich Schiller which was erected in 1839 by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. Thorvaldsen's statue was the first memorial to Schiller to be erected in Germany.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first known brick building in Stuttgart - the Stuthaus or mare house - stood next to the adjacent Stiftskirche (collegiate church). It is therefore supposed that the square was originally used as a horse breeding area around 1000 years ago (in keeping with Stuttgart's history). After the 12th century the square was probably covered in simple houses before other stone houses such as the Fruchtkasten were built. In the mid-14th century the D\u00fcrnitzbau wing of the Old Castle (next to Schillerplatz) was erected. The Old Chancellery was built in 1542 shortly before completion of the Arkadenfl\u00fcgel wing of the Old Castle. The area between the Old Castle and the Chancellery became a moat.In 1594 Duke Friedrich I asked his master builder Heinrich Schickhardt to turn today's Schillerplatz into a Renaissance square. Residents' houses were bought and demolished. The new square was laid with cobblestones and called 'Castle and Chancellery Square'. The dimensions of the square have not changed since.In 1607 work began on the Gesandtenhaus (a type of ambassador's house) which is now known as the Prinzenbau and was finally completed in 1677. In 1711 the Prinzenbau was extended behind the Old Chancellery with an arch in the northernmost corner of Schillerplatz. On the opposite, southern side of the square between the Old Castle and Stiftskirche the first Stuttgart Caf\u00e9 opened in 1712. It was replaced in 1798 by the K\u00f6nig von England inn (King of England Inn). This was shortly after the moat surrounding the Old Castle had finally been filled in leaving the square the way it stands today.The square was officially renamed Schillerplatz in 1934 in memory of one of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's most famous writers and intellectuals.During the Second World War of the buildings around Schillerplatz were burnt down but all were reconstructed after the war with the exception of the King of England Inn.\nThe underground car park was built in 1972-3.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\nHarald Schukraft: Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfen-Geschichte(n).

        "wiki": "Stuttgart ( SHTUUT-gart, also US:  STU(U)T-, STOOT-, SHTOOT-; German: [\u02c8\u0283t\u028at\u0261a\u0281t] (listen); Swabian: Schduagert [\u02c8\u0292\u030ad\u0325ua\u032f\u0261\u030a\u025b\u0295d\u0325]; names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:\n\nThe Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534. Exterior: Romanesque/Gothic; interior: Romanesque/Gothic/Modern. Reconstructed with simplified interior after World War II.\nAltes Schloss (the Old Castle), mostly dating from the late 15th century, some parts date back to 1320. Renaissance style; reconstructed\nAlte Kanzlei (the Old Chancellery) on Schillerplatz square which backs onto the 1598 Mercury Pillar\nNeues Schloss (the New Castle), completed in 1807. Baroque/Classicism); reconstructed with modern interior, currently houses government offices. The cellars with a collection of stone fragments from the Roman times are open to visitors\nWilhelmpalais (the King Wilhelm Palais), 1840\nK\u00f6nigsbau (the King's Building), 1850. Classicism; reconstructed; has been housing the \"K\u00f6nigsbau Passagen\" shopping centre since 2006.\nThe Gro\u00dfes Haus of Stuttgart National Theatre, 1909\u20131912\nMarkthalle Market Hall, 1910. (Art Nouveau)\nThe Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) was designed in 1920; its stark, functional lines are typical of the artistic trend 'Neue Sachlichkeit' (New Objectivity)\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek state library, rebuilt in 1970.\nFriedrichsbau Variet\u00e9 (Friedrich Building), rebuilt in 1994 on the site of the former art nouveau building\n\n\n=== Architecture in other districts ===\n\nA number of significant castles stand in Stuttgart's suburbs and beyond as reminders of the city's royal past. These include:\n\nCastle Solitude, 1700\u20131800. Baroque/Rococo)\nLudwigsburg Palace, 1704\u20131758. Baroque, with its enormous baroque garden.\nCastle Hohenheim, 1771\u20131793Other landmarks in and around Stuttgart include (see also museums below):\n\nCastle Rosenstein (1822\u20131830) Classical\nW\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum (1824) which holds the remains of Catherine Pavlovna of Russia and King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg\nWilhelma Zoo and Botanical Gardens (1853)\nThe Observation Tower of Burgholzhof an 1891 brick observation tower constructed by the Cannstatt municipal architect Friedrich Keppler on behalf of the Versch\u00f6nerungsverein Cannstatt e. V. (\"Society for the Beautification of Cannstatt\"), in the style of a Roman tower.\nWeissenhof Estate (1927), (International Style)\nThe TV Tower (1950), the world's first concrete TV tower\nStuttgart Airport Terminal Building, 2000. In neighboring Leinfelden-Echterdingen\n\n\n=== Parks, lakes, cemeteries and other places of interest ===\n \nAt the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists. Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.\nOther parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandsh\u00f6he hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Wei\u00dfenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at 511 metres (1,677 ft) the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300\u2013400 years old).\n\nThere are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium. Established in 1873 it was extended to include Jewish graves in 1874 and also now houses the Russian Orthodox Church of Alexander Nevsky\nThe Uff-Kirchhof cemetery in Bad Cannstatt which stands at the crossroads of two ancient Roman roads and Cannstatter Hauptfriedhof, the largest graveyard in Stuttgart which has been used as a Muslim burial ground since 1985.The city boasts the largest mineral water deposits in Europe after Budapest, with over 250 springs within the urban area.\n\n\n=== Culture and events ===\n\nStuttgart is known for its rich cultural heritage, in particular its State Theatre (Staatstheater) and State Gallery (Staatsgalerie). The Staatstheater is home to the State opera and three smaller theatres. It regularly stages opera, ballet and theatre productions as well as concerts. The Staatstheater was named Germany/Austria/Switzerland \"Theatre of the year\" in 2006; the Stuttgart Opera has won the 'Opera of the year' award six times. Stuttgart Ballet is connected to names like John Cranko and Marcia Hayd\u00e9e.\nStuttgart is also home to one of Germany's most prestigious symphony orchestras, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra, with famous English conductor Sir Roger Norrington, who developed a distinct sound of that orchestra, known as the Stuttgart Sound. They mostly perform in the Liederhalle concert hall.\nThe city offers two Broadway-style musical theaters, the Apollo and the Palladium Theater (each approx. 1800 seats). Ludwigsburg Palace in the nearby town of Ludwigsburg is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.\nAs a result of Stuttgart's long history of viticulture (Even today there are vineyards less than 500 m (1,640 ft) from the Main Station), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the \"St\u00e4ffele\") around the city, equivalent to approximately 20 km (12 mi) of steps. Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond. For example, Gaisburger Marsch is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart's Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.\n\nIn October 2009 the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced that the European Union was to officially recognise the pasta dish Maultaschen as a \"regional specialty\", thus marking its significance to the cultural heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.In 1993 Stuttgart hosted the International Garden Show in the suburb of Killesberg. In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the Football World Cup. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. In 2008 it was host to the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships.

The Stuttgart-based Pentecostal Gospel Forum is the largest place of worship (megachurch) in Germany. It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy W\u00fcrttemberg until 1806, the W\u00fcrttemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen W\u00fcrttemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart. The archived material is in principle open to the public and can be consulted in the reading room in Bellingweg 21 in Bad Cannstatt.\nThe Landeskirchliche Archives preserve the stocks of the W\u00fcrttemberg church leaders and of other ecclesial bodies and institutions: the ducal and royal W\u00fcrttemberg consistory, the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, deanery and parish archives, educational institutions, the works and associations as well as estates and collections.

Since 2005, the instigators are working on a memoir about \"The dead town\". So far, about 5,000 names of victims of the regime of National Socialism have been acquired.\nThere are two large tours that are available to visitors to Stuttgart. The first is the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (also called the CityTour Stuttgart), lasting from 10 AM to 4 PM that takes visitors around the city. The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Some of its most prominent companies include Daimler AG, Porsche, Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sika \u2013 all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.\nStuttgart is home to Germany's ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nThe city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg after Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and Freiburg.

Today, four of these schools are located in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== International School ===\nSince 1985 Stuttgart is home to the International School of Stuttgart, one of fewer than 100 schools worldwide that offer all three International Baccalaureate programs- the IB Primary Years (Early Learning to Grade 5), IB Middle Years (Grade 6 to 10), IB Diploma (grades 11\u201312). The International School of Stuttgart is accredited by both the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.\n\n\n== Media and publishing ==\nOne of the headquarters of the public S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR; Southwest Broadcasting) channels (several radio and one TV channel; regional focus on the southwestern German States of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate) is located in Stuttgart (the other ones being Baden-Baden and Mainz).

This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (Umweltzone), including vehicles from abroad.\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\n\nStuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a 'U' symbol, which stands for Untergrundbahn (underground rail). Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfenbahnen AG (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the Stuttgart S-Bahn, using tracks supplied by the national Deutsche Bahn AG (DB).\nA peculiarity of Stuttgart is the Zahnradbahn, a rack railway that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch. It is the only urban rack railway in Germany. Stuttgart also has a Standseilbahn, a funicular railway that operates in the Heslach area and the forest cemetery (Waldfriedhof). In Killesberg Park, on a prominent hill overlooking the city, there is the miniature railway run by diesel (and on weekends with steam).\n\n\n=== Rail links ===\n\nStuttgart is a hub in the Intercity-Express and Intercity networks of Deutsche Bahn AG (DB), with through services to most other major German cities.

The Stuttgart 21 project will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart's enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and should be completed in 2020.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Stuttgart Airport (German: Flughafen Stuttgart, IATA airport code STR), an international airport approximately 13 km (8 mi) south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns. It takes 30 minutes to reach the airport from the city center using S-Bahn lines S2 or S3. Stuttgart airport is Germany's only international airport with one runway. Despite protests and local initiatives, surveys are currently underway to assess the impact of a second runway.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Autobahn A8, that runs east\u2013west from Karlsruhe to Munich, and Autobahn A81 that runs north\u2013south from W\u00fcrzburg to Singen. The Autobahn A831 is a short spur entering the southern side of Stuttgart.\n\nBesides these Autobahns, Stuttgart is served by a large number of expressways, many of which are built to Autobahn standards, and were once intended to carry an A-number. Important expressways like B10, B14, B27 and B29 connect Stuttgart with its suburbs. Due to the hilly surroundings, there are many road tunnels in and around Stuttgart.

          "I was quite bored in this museum. Not only is the entrance price rather expensive, but there is not art work presented at all. On top of this, there is not much interesting information presented alongside the artwork. I would advise to skip this museum, unless you have a week to",

          "I really enjoyed this one. It is in an amazing glass building with great views of the city of Stuttgart. Amazing collection of contemporary art, most of it German. I spent half a day here and was one of the few patrons there. What a shame!",

          "It was 'Meh ok' I guess. Compared to some galleries, it offered nothing new to me. The video exhibits offer subtitles in English but many sections of art require German to be read for most. The descriptions and stories behind the art are minimal. It will take no more than 2",

          "German art is well represented in this small museum. Some French impressionist works, but otherwise a small regional art museum. Don't be put off by the lime green lego-land look of the entrance, they have a strong collection of modern art here.",
          "I liked the fact that it was open until 21.00 at Friday night, I only visited the main standing exhibition. Otto Dix works are amazing, others did not draw my attention. It is considerable small and may not take more than 1 hour of your time.",
          "Because I live paintings and art I usually make sure to visit at least one art museum where ever I go.This had a lot of modern paintings which are not my passion and a few interesting Picasso,Braque,Klee Pisarro ,Monet,Manet,but don't expect a huge collection.Interesting some",

          "Not that the palace doesn't look great on the outside (even though it cannot even be compared to Sans Souci, which many seem to suggest, but in terms of organization, logistics and service for me this place is a total disaster. First, you can get in only with a guided tour.",
          "This certainly would not be on my \"top...\" lists but was OK to see for free on my StuttCard. I was told I had to take a tour if I wanted to see inside, and the only tour available was in German. That was fine, I understood enough of it to know basically what was being said (the",

          "This was our first time visiting Schloss Solitude, and I thought it was okay. It\u2019s not very big, but worth seeing. Evidently, it was a hunting lodge/summer home for Duke Von Wurtenberg. We did the tour ~\u20ac2, and it was interesting. The grounds were nice, but no where as nice as",
          "This is the first time I have visited Solitude since I was in my early 20's. I still get the feeling of peace and serenity here. Great attraction to visit while you are in town.",

          "Not a lot of activity to engage in here, but the grounds are a beautiful place to walk around, or sit and enjoy the peace and quiet. The building is majestic, and the view overlooking the city is good on a clear day.",
          "The castle tour is only offered in German so we opted to not go inside. We wondered around the outside instead. We walked back to where the gardens had once been, but only found dense forest. The view of Stuttgart is beautiful from there.",
          "We were visiting friends who lived nearby in Weissach and they drove us out to see this place as we both have interest in old castles. The view from this hilltop is incredible and worth visiting just for the view. This castle was built in the 1760s as a hunting lodge and summer",

          "Starting at the University of Stuttgart's Vaihingen campus, we went into the Pfaffenwald. From there, it's a 5km hike (more of a straight walk on a nice paved road though!) to the Schloss Solitude. You get a beautiful view on the North of Stuttgart, and you can sit on the grass",

          "Email or call the palace before you go if you want a tour in English. (They offer tours in English, but only certain times.) I ended up doing a tour in German because I didn't want to wait 4 hours. It was a beautiful palace, I just couldn't understand anything that was said.",
          "The palace is quite impressive from the outside, but the only tours available the day we visited were in German. You are not allowed in the palace unless on a tour so we chose not to go. It is also not handicapped accessible.",

          "We visited the SCHLOSS SOLITUDE - CASTLE SULITUDE in Ludwigsburg - near Stuttgart - Germany, and \u00e9njoyed the tour of the Castle to the max. The guide was very knowledgeable, efficient and friendly. This is the summer residence \u00f3f the former DUKE, and in mostly original good",
          "Despite its name the building complex concerned is not actually a castle, it looks rather like a little palace. The Duke Carl Eugen von W\u00fcrttemberg chose the place where those buildings stand, owing to its peaceful nature, as a place of retreat for the construction of a refuge",
          "This castle some km out of Stuttgart is a nice place at good weather to have a walk around or do nice pictures. The stairs of the castle are very famous for wedding pictures. Off course you can also do your privte pictures if you are not (yet) merried",

          "We went on a sunday when everything else was closed. Did not get a guided tour to the inside but the grounds are awesome and lots of people biking in this area and/or just sitting down for a picnic. Nice place to get away from the city and it was only 15 minutes away.",
          "If you like history, the Schloss Solitude is interesting but small compare to other castles in Europe. Parking is not a problem but there is no rest room or a place to have a sit and enjoy the solitude if that is what you are looking for.",
          "Pros: beauty of baroque architecture, opportunities to walk or bike in beautiful woods surrounding the schloss, watch other people's weddings & celebrations. Cons: a bit hard to get to the schloss, bike ride will be ideal if it can be arranged from Ludwigsburg, a direct route",
          "It was fun to see the differences (and similarities) in style between this castle and one in Berlin, plus all of the French chateaus I've seen. There is one white room that is just stunning - it looks like a wedding should be hosted there! While we were prepared for a German",
          "Evidently, Carl Eugen never lived here, but it did house his mistress. Very scenic, though the garden could do with some restoration. Great excursion for a sunny day.",
          "Called solitude this hunting lodge built in baroque style is a great place to visit. On a sunny day you can enjoy the greenery surrounding the schloss. Nice place for photography enthusiast. You can find nice restaurant and ice cream vans. Do visit it for scenic beauty as well",
          "This is another place I bring my friends who are visiting Stuttgart. I love that you can see the 13 km straight-line road to Ludwigsburg from the Schloss Solitude lawn. I have never been inside the Schloss, but I'm not a museum-type person, but I love the castle and its perch",
          "There area few buildings where one can enter, some exhibitions to take a look at and really charming area arround. You can get there with a direct bus from centre (Stadtmitte). From there you can take a (pretty long) wald to the lake nearby. Beautifull architecture.",
          "Probably you have seen much of it - in Germany you can find such castles almost in all big cities. This one, though, wins due to its location as well - at the top of the hill, overlooking a great field and the city in the far. Can be windy in the winter, so choose your clothing",
          "We came here via the bus that dropped us at the estate door. It was very easy to get to and worth the trip. I highly recommend the tour, which they can do in multiple languages. The guide we had was excellent and seeing this \"hunting lodge\" was a nice afternoon spent",
          "Beautiful little rococo gem on a hill outside Stuttgart. The parks around it are a favorite among locals \u2013 families with children and lovers alike. In the summer you can almost not find a weekend without bridal couples posing on the grand stairs. The impressive rococo inside",
          "Its a nice castle to go in Stuttgart, and can be easily reachable with the bus. I'd rather say that its a perfect photographic point. A perfect place for hiking and picnic.",
          "Although closed when I visited.... it was a nice walk around the building complex. Make sure to google or ask the locals about closing times, I always ended up showing up when the places were closing or closed. (around 4pm)",
          "Perfect place for that cheeky family photo, the sheer enormity of the square itself is amazing. Recommenced to come during winter during the christmas market down the road.",
          "It\u00b4s nice to go there for a picnic or something. The castle looks nice (there are guided tours inside) and the park around is full of people in summertime.",
          "Beautiful castle with amazing views, and crisp clean air, we visited in autumn so we were surrounded by a myriad of rustic colours, perfect place for a rugged up picnic after an invigorating hike, this area is surrounded by walking trails, chestnut trees line the road to the",
          "Perched atop a hill and accessible by car, bike, or a myriad of hiking trails, Schloss Solitude is a throwback to dynastic Europe that now offers tours. You can buy tickets to tour the Schloss on location, and then chill on the huge lawn, look over Stuttgart, and enjoy a great",
          "Best way to reach this castle is either through a hike in the fires, where then the palace pops up as a surprise after a long walk. Or through the surrounding horse stables. Enjoy a wonderful view from the front gardens of the palace. A very good place to enjoy a cup of tea or",
          "This castle round about 15 km outsite of Stuttgart is a jewel. Very beautiful restoration. Very often a place to take wedding pictures. The castle is part of a huge ground of historical buildings of that time were the duke of Wuerttemberg used to live in silcence only with a",
          "Unfortunately,having driven half an hour to get there,we found the castle and restaurant closed at lunch time and couldn't spare the time to wait an hour and a half for opening, so I can't make any comment about the interior. There are differing opening hours each day,very",
          "Having visited Gerlingen a number of times we have walked in the grounds of the palace on a few occassions, but this time we got to see inside. It is truly spectacular. It's a neoclassical building with frescos and murals adding to the splendour. It is only possible to see",
          "when there the castle was already closed, however the surroundings are very nice and offer a nice view on the city. a lot of people go also there to do a jogging in the nice forest surounding the castle",
          "A really beautiful building with a great view in front of it. We were told that the King/Prince who lived in Ludwigsburg used to watch out until he saw his Mistress/Lover leave Solitude on her way to him.",
          "Wow, what a lovely area. We enjoyed our tour. The guide spoke to us in English. She was concerned because the tour is labeled to be in German. We enjoyed learning about the history, furnishing and meeting place for the Royalty. The garden is beautiful",
          "Lovely spot for quite reflection and to enjoy the magnificent views over Stuttgart. If you choose the tour its well worth it to see one of Carl Eugen's folly's. The tours are in German but our guide was kind enough to translate into English as well just for us! The small but",
          "Sorry! Dont mean to scare you with the title but this place is really a place to find your solace. You understand how much you needed it once you are here from all the busy life in the city. Go to this Schloss with your loved ones and u will hav the time you deserve :)",
          "a small but pretty castle with its beautiful history. An excellent place for cuisine, the kitchen is first class. The ambiance is charming and inviting to spend more occasions in this area. The surroundings is simply wonderful. You really feel like living in the good old baroque",
          "The area around it is very green and picturesque and it is not as crowded as the palace in Stuttgart. Many couples get married here since the place is simply romantic.",
          "Schloss Solitude is beautiful, fairly difficult to access without own transport, although there is a bus service. The views are superb - and the restaurant excellent too.",
          "Brilliant place and ground, peaceful place to enjoy a nice walk with fantastic views over Stuttgart. On a clear day you can see the road to Ludwigsburg which connected Solitude to the town.",
          "After our hike in the area, our hiking group visited the schloss. It is only accessible through a private tour, but we enjoyed the opportunity. We had an English-speaking guide, and we learned a lot about this lovely palace. It was exceptionally cold inside the palace (in",
          "The castle is a beautiful example of barock architecture. Take tour time and walk the grounds and if you have the time.",
          "We went to Schloss Solitude on a cold and rainy day. The tour was nice, but not as extensive as we all wanted. The grounds are beautiful for a nice day though. I great place to have a picnic with a BEAUTIFUL backdrop either looking at the castle or looking out over Stuttgart.",
          "Compared with other palaces around Stuttgart, this one is rather small but worth a half day visit on a sunny day. The palace visit is organized several times a day by German-speaking guides only. On a sunny day it is possible to enjoy the view to the surrounding towns from the",
          "Love wandering the woods around the Schloss, great trails and even better views. A great place to take family pictures, picnic or just hang out.",
          "I've been there for my friend's wedding. Modest little chapel, excellent for the small weddings. Enjoy great view outside!",
          "Schloss Solitude won't blow anyone's mind, but it's a nice destination for a stroll when in Stuttgart, especially when you're nearby anyway! The view and the surroundings are really nice too. Nothing mind blowing, but still very nice!",
          "An easy get away. We didnt even go inside, just pulled up and had a picnic on the lawn with the view of downtown Stuttgart. Two bridal parties were their taking photos. Lovely. You have to pay to go inside, less than 10Euro. But the garden/lawn area is free!",
          "Went in evening It is a lovely place nice big park and a restaurant that was shut as saw in evening.",
          "The castle is not the big of the region but the view is great. It is very nice to grill in from of the garden (family, group of friends or even couples).",
          "Amazing schloss!!! Well worth the trip to go see it.. Have been to many castles in Europe and this is one of the nicest..",
          "Hello. This is a wonderful, hidden gem outside Stuttgart. Not only is it historic but a wonderful setting in the forests. Very peaceful and beautiful. Be at one with the natural world just outside one of Germany's major cities. You can take walks along well-trodden paths, see",

Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:\n\nThe Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534. Exterior: Romanesque/Gothic; interior: Romanesque/Gothic/Modern. Reconstructed with simplified interior after World War II.\nAltes Schloss (the Old Castle), mostly dating from the late 15th century, some parts date back to 1320. Renaissance style; reconstructed\nAlte Kanzlei (the Old Chancellery) on Schillerplatz square which backs onto the 1598 Mercury Pillar\nNeues Schloss (the New Castle), completed in 1807. Baroque/Classicism); reconstructed with modern interior, currently houses government offices. The cellars with a collection of stone fragments from the Roman times are open to visitors\nWilhelmpalais (the King Wilhelm Palais), 1840\nK\u00f6nigsbau (the King's Building), 1850. Classicism; reconstructed; has been housing the \"K\u00f6nigsbau Passagen\" shopping centre since 2006.\nThe Gro\u00dfes Haus of Stuttgart National Theatre, 1909\u20131912\nMarkthalle Market Hall, 1910. (Art Nouveau)\nThe Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) was designed in 1920; its stark, functional lines are typical of the artistic trend 'Neue Sachlichkeit' (New Objectivity)\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek state library, rebuilt in 1970.\nFriedrichsbau Variet\u00e9 (Friedrich Building), rebuilt in 1994 on the site of the former art nouveau building\n\n\n=== Architecture in other districts ===\n\nA number of significant castles stand in Stuttgart's suburbs and beyond as reminders of the city's royal past. These include:\n\nCastle Solitude, 1700\u20131800. Baroque/Rococo)\nLudwigsburg Palace, 1704\u20131758. Baroque, with its enormous baroque garden.\nCastle Hohenheim, 1771\u20131793Other landmarks in and around Stuttgart include (see also museums below):\n\nCastle Rosenstein (1822\u20131830) Classical\nW\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum (1824) which holds the remains of Catherine Pavlovna of Russia and King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg\nWilhelma Zoo and Botanical Gardens (1853)\nThe Observation Tower of Burgholzhof an 1891 brick observation tower constructed by the Cannstatt municipal architect Friedrich Keppler on behalf of the Versch\u00f6nerungsverein Cannstatt e. V. (\"Society for the Beautification of Cannstatt\"), in the style of a Roman tower.\nWeissenhof Estate (1927), (International Style)\nThe TV Tower (1950), the world's first concrete TV tower\nStuttgart Airport Terminal Building, 2000. In neighboring Leinfelden-Echterdingen\n\n\n=== Parks, lakes, cemeteries and other places of interest ===\n \nAt the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists. Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.\nOther parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandsh\u00f6he hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Wei\u00dfenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at 511 metres (1,677 ft) the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300\u2013400 years old).\n\nThere are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium. Established in 1873 it was extended to include Jewish graves in 1874 and also now houses the Russian Orthodox Church of Alexander Nevsky\nThe Uff-Kirchhof cemetery in Bad Cannstatt which stands at the crossroads of two ancient Roman roads and Cannstatter Hauptfriedhof, the largest graveyard in Stuttgart which has been used as a Muslim burial ground since 1985.The city boasts the largest mineral water deposits in Europe after Budapest, with over 250 springs within the urban area.\n\n\n=== Culture and events ===\n\nStuttgart is known for its rich cultural heritage, in particular its State Theatre (Staatstheater) and State Gallery (Staatsgalerie). The Staatstheater is home to the State opera and three smaller theatres. It regularly stages opera, ballet and theatre productions as well as concerts. The Staatstheater was named Germany/Austria/Switzerland \"Theatre of the year\" in 2006; the Stuttgart Opera has won the 'Opera of the year' award six times. Stuttgart Ballet is connected to names like John Cranko and Marcia Hayd\u00e9e.\nStuttgart is also home to one of Germany's most prestigious symphony orchestras, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra, with famous English conductor Sir Roger Norrington, who developed a distinct sound of that orchestra, known as the Stuttgart Sound.

Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond.

It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in.

The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry.

Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation.

          "Absolutely insane but awesome museum. Who knew there was so much pig-themed tack in the world? Some of the more abstract art was quirky and fun.",
          "Ok, when me and my wife heard there was a museum dedicated to pigs we had to check it. We took a hop on hop off tour through Stuttgart, and reached this museum. The place has lots of different statues and trinkets with pig images. It's a curious tour, and if you have spare time",
          "one can ever see too much \"pork\" items! Not very well maintained, some items lack care but overall interesting and amusing. EUR6,9 to access, a bit too much for the experience",
          "We had a great time with pig ph s while there. Going hog wild and squealing for joy. You get the picture. I don\u2019t recommend going on a hot day or you\u2019ll sweat like a pig!! It\u2019s super fun and you have to go at least once to say you\u2019ve seen it!! Quite impressive",
          "Very poor museum ! someone has collect pigs from anywhere ! Don't waste your few euros! it was a very bad experience",
          "Very kitchy! We were expecting to see a bit more about the relationship of the pig and the German culture, but this was still excellent. The staff was very informative when we entered the self guided museum. Much of it is very tchotchke-ish/flea-market-ish but still very fun",
          "It ought to be a fun place to visit - hundreds of different pig-themed toys, ornaments, soft furnishings, books... But the overarching theme seems to be \"quantity not quality\", and it's just room after room of pig artifacts piled high; often, ten of the same object, lined up",
          "We found this museum very fun and quirky. Who knew the world had so many Pig themed items? It was room after room after room of Pig paraphernalia. We went hog wild on our puns and laughter as we toured two huge floors of pig items. There was something for everyone. (And a bit",

          "We visited here whilst on holiday. When we arrived, the front door was shut. We tentatively opened it and went inside. We stood for a while until a lady eventually came. She was very unfriendly and continued on the phone whilst serving us. The museum itself was great - even",

          "I wanted to visit the museum so I arranged my schedule to ensure I can make it before the last entry ( closing time 6:45pm, last entry 5:45pm) and I actually make it before the last entry (arrived at 5:40pm) but the staff told me that they are closing because there is no visitor",
          "We went as part of a two family group w 4 children under 5, and had an absolute blast. The museum was two full floors of pig everything, and it did not disappoint. Banks, statues, cups, wall hangings, and the boys\u2019 most favorite\u2014the dinosaurs w pig heads. I loved the bday room",

          "Would say it\u2019s more two floors of pig based paraphernalia from around the world than museum. Definitely a unique way to spend an hour or two. Restaurant was relatively busy, and the food looked good, but we didn\u2019t eat.",
          "Full disclosure, we have a daughter with a pig obsession, but this was a terrific way to spend a few hours. Not for everyone, and please go into it with the right mindset. The museum does a good job of descriping the exhibits in general, and has good, if basic information.",
          "Full of pigs (obviously) but a bit higgledy piggedly (no pun intended). No real organisation and not a place to spend hours in. We wanted a coffee but they only seemed set up for a full meal. Also no where near to get a drink.",

          "This is the kind of place that some people will probably love because it really is completely unique and very, very eccentric. I personally would say that there are much better things to do in Stuttgart than visit a pig museum. It is stuffed full of pigs of all shapes and sizes.",

          "Some very strange person, probably with a recognisable mental disorder, has collected literally thousands of pig statues, toys, pictures, bits. Several rooms, (about 10 too many for us ) are packed with this stuff. Kind of fascinating, kind of weird. Not sure it was worth 5.90",

          "My son loved this place, I, however, was overwhelmed with the amount of tacky knick knacks in every single room. We did not eat in the restaurant, so my review is solely for the museum. I would return to try the restaurant, not to the \"museum\".",

          "Day 2 of our cycling holiday brought us to Stuttgart and the Schweine-Museum wasn't too far from our route. Plus the rain was lashing down so we thought the museum would provide some shelter for a while. Located in a former slaughterhouse, it is home to thousands of stuffed",

          "The museum was about what I expected. It was fun and kitch with some interesting facts and a good amount of English. I liked the piggy banks and my toddler was able to move freely between rooms. The downside is the stairs. Stairs to get in the door. Down two flights of stairs",
          "It is like going to a grandmother's home that collected pigs all her life, except there is a room of naughty pigs doing naughty things to each other's pig bodies. My favorite room was about hunting wild boars. Some rooms have beautiful displays of windows, but they are",
          "We visited the museum during the long nights of the museum in stuttgart but didnt knew what we should expect. It was so funny so many pigs in all possible clothes and sizes. Funny and sexy over 3 floors. If you want special museums experience you should go there.",
          "This is a VERY unusual museum, but it's not worth the trouble to visit. One can only look at so many pigs before becoming totally bored.",
          "I was expecting more of how we grow pigs, what types of pigs there are so on since i didn't read review. A museum was full of pig figures, on moments a little terrifying. Wouldn't recomend to all people. Just thing before you visit, maybe you would like to see other things in",
          "At the pig museum you get what it says on the sign, pigs, pigs and more pigs! Room after room of quaint, beautiful, tacky, weird and wonderful things, all porcine related. I don't think I will ever need to visit another pig museum for the rest of my life, all my pig related",
          "Who ever said that this is a must see in stuttgart needs to think again, its more like someone had a pig fetish. Its just shelves and shelves of pig memoribilia with little explanation of what was in the room. In our opinion, it was boring, smelly, and not worth the time or",
          "It's the first pig museum we have been to! A curious collection of pig memorabilia from around the world hosted on two cramped floors on a former abattoir. Some very funny artifacts. The restaurant (mostly pig-based) was excellent, too. Good value",
          "We visited the Schweine Museum today and had a fabulous time. Being an English speaker, I was very happy to see that the rooms all had translations of what we were looking at. Yes, the museum consists of a lot of pig toys, pig art, pig books, and other stuff. It's a vast",
          "Its a Swine Toys Museum and nothing much. Might be fun for Kids but not for all. The restaurant is supposed to be good. But we havent tried it",
          "It worth a visit. Just for fun. The museum itself is more of a collectors exhibit, but on a huge scale. The collection is not small so you will get annoyed at a certain momement by number of pink exibits. But still go! you will get an hour or two of hours laughing. And teh food",
          "If you plan to visit the Mercedes museum then why not take a short walk across the river and visit the pig museum. We did, and then took the train into the city. Keep an open mind when visiting the museum, it's basically a vast collection of pig memorabilia! The items on",
          "By far the oddest museum I've ever visited, once you get over the oddness its fabulous, imagine a pig collectors collection on a huge scale! We ate at the restaurant here too, the food was amazing and the service fabulous, would absolutely recommend it!",
          "we visited the Mercedes museum and halfway through the visit we took a break for lunch and it was a pleasant surprise! The restaurant is really the only reason to go to the museum. Great food, nice atmosphere. The museum itself is more of a collectors exhibit. We will be back.",
          "Such a quirky little museum - great fun to wander around! There's plenty of information and random facts about the pig. I never knew there was so much pig memorabilia! It's not a serious museum, but worth a visit if you want some fun and something a little different!",
          "So this was a fun museum that does everything pig, except maybe the squeal. You'll know you got to the museum by the pig sculptures on the outside. Not science oriented at all, but there are a few rooms discussing pig breeds and what-not. It's mostly pig things. It's fun to",
          "If you want to know a see all about pig it is \"necessary\" to visit this museum. You can find a lot of stuffs about pig and you can have 1 hour of fun while you visit all the rooms of the museum. It is very good for children.",
          "You know this will be a fun place when you drive up and there is a pig pink pig sculpture in the front lawn area inviting kids to jump on. Inside there is everything about pigs and pork in Germany. Fascinating but the best might still be the restaurant attached to the museum",
          "maybe I have not prepared sufficiently what I am going to see here. This museum is definetely funny, but for my taste I am expecting much more information about pigs, then provided. And this museum as well provides information about pigs :-) But mostly embedded in other meaning.",
          "Amazing collection of pigs of every type! Went there coz we have a friend (in Australia ) whom we give pigs to every birthday. Room after room after room after room etc etc etc .Could not believe how many there were. Pigged out on Pigs !! Excellent for a fun experience.",
          "A very unique and funny place to see thousands of pigs. This is a simple museum collection of pigs of any kinds and cannot be made better than it is in my opinion. Worth a visit once.",
          "The museum offered a fascinating review of the role schwein in popular culture, history, the arts etomology and of course cuisine. It provided several interesting perspectives of an animal that has been so important to homo sapiens throughout its modern development pretty much",
          "Great place to spend a couple of hours. More of a collection but plenty of informative guides as you wonder round. Great place to eat too",
          "After seeing the \"pig museum\" during our Hop On, Hop Off orientation and having our driver tell us that not only was the museum interesting, but also the restaurant was delicious, we journeyed back on Saturday, July 23rd to have a leisurely lunch. We were given our choice of",
          "We thought this would be a good 'family' museum to visit with our 9 year old son. We found it boring and of no great interest at all. Against other sites to see in Stuttgart, this was very poor.",
          "Has to be one of the most unusual museums I have been in but it was a lot of fun! Kids would love it. Thousands and thousands of things to do with pigs. You should visit as was very amusing.",
          "very different but enjoyed,staff friendly,lots of pigs to look at pottery ,toys etc,good to visit on a rainy day,we went mid week",
          "Plenty of pigs around outside the Museum and ij the Biergarten. Sat in the sun out back. Dropped by on way back from Mercedes Museum",
          "Been here twice, like my son said, \"what a strange museum?!!\" This museum is all about the pigs, so different than regular museum, and yet interesting you have to see it to believe it,",
          "I'd decided on this trip to Europe that I'd had enough of museums and art galleries but saw this advertised in Lonely Planet and decided it was something different, I like pigs so why not check it out? I arrived just before 11am (opening time) and was waiting on the porch",
          "We wandered in to get out of the rain and spent two fun and interesting hours in this, the largest Schweine Museum in the world. I'm not sure if I've seen anything like it anywhere. The rooms are spread out over two large floors and contain everything from a pig throne,",
          "Even if you find pigs disgusting, this is one very amazing to visit, you will have fun! Be ready to take some pictures and even learn something about pigs!",
          "Probably one of the strangest of museums I have ever visited.Thousands of model pigs on display.Thankfully the narration are in English as well as German.Unusual but very interesting..By the way the entrance fee is currently \u20ac6.90.",
          "Hopped off the tour bus,we-have never seen such a display of pigs in all colours shapes, poses around 45 thousand exhibits all categorised and displayed over 2 huge floors in a lovely building. There is a charge to get in --(doesn't tell you this in the bus guide) but well worth",
          "OMG! firts of all, from little square where this museum is located you will see many pigs but many for real, well this a cool idea museum ever a collection of thousands but of millions of pigs in the world, you will see it is caray all things that you can imagine are",
          "This is a quirky museum full of pig, pigs and more pigs! And it is a MUST to have lunch or dinner there! It is not to be missed!",
          "This was a fascinating museum in the way the bearded lady at the circus is a fascinating sight. Definitely worth the entrance fee (~$5) if only to say you saw it. Every corner you turned, every room you entered was another pig display. Erotic pigs, working pigs, cartoon pigs and",
          "Everything about pigs! Fun! We loved it! Too bad my kids are not here to see. They would have liked the kids corner too.",
          "I've never seen so many pigs in my life. If you're looking for an interesting and different museum this is one for you. There's a pig for everything you could think of! The museum is both educational and funny as you walk through different rooms filled with different",
          "The museum was fun and interesting, with lots of information in English. However I would say that it is not so much of a museum as it is a large collection of Pig based trinkets. It was a lot of fun and a quick tour, something interesting if you are looking for a unique",
          "We went to the museum with the expectation of it being a bit crazy and we were not disappointed. If you like pigs you will love it! 3 floors full of rooms with 1000's of pig related objects. The further u go on the more random it gets! It looks like someone once bought some",
          "The museum itself was pretty interesting. The museum certainly has thousands of memorabilia, art, and figurines of pigs. There is also a lot of educational and exhibits for kids there. The restaurant and beer garden are great as well which makes it a couple hour trip if you",
          "If you are in Stuttgart a visit to the Schweine-Museum should be on your agenda to sample the piggy madness in every room of this old slaughter house which is now the museum. The building itself is restored beautifully and the collection of pigs....well you have to see it to",
          "This museum is more about the cafe actually (their opening hours make it kind of obvious). The cafe food was a 7/10 and a bit overpriced. The museum is more a collection of souvenirs than a museum as such. It seems a bit randomly curated and organised. It would help if there",
          "This gave us tremendous fun, we laughed from start to finish. Just so different and a huge amount of fun. Just love the pink pig tram. It is a one off for sure and for 5 euro entry, well worth the visit. Just another gem we found during our visit to Stuttgart.",
          "We discover this museum by accident 'cause it was included in the Stuttcard attractions. It's very original, nice. It's quite big, 2 floors full of pigs, all shapes and dimensions, a huge collection. Nice and warm place, a friendly lady explained everything kindly. So many",
          "There are two stories of swine souvenirs packed for you to behold. Includes a large collection of swine stuff, from kitschy to erotica. Interesting. I was disappointed that the museum had no \"Pig Pig\" items from Atlanta, GA...maybe it did, but I missed them. A little pricey",
          "If you're the type of person who has 'Guinness record holder for museum with most pig figurines' on your bucket list, then you should definitely check out the Schwein Museum. If that doesn't sound amazing to you, I would probably steer clear, as it is a bit pricey for what it",
          "When in Stuttgart get yourself along to the Schweine or (pig) museum. If you are into all or some things pig this is the place for you. You will not believe the amount of things that are pig related? From toys to ornaments to garden sculptures. There's even a small room, adult",
          "So many exhibits can blow your mind away. One of a kind in this world.after the tour you can dine at the restaurant which serves pork of course .",
          "A pleasant surprise. While this place may not be to everyone's 'taste' It's an amazing collection of anything pig ,from a huge collection of piggy banks,pig figurines ,history of pig breeds,toys etc Good value ,also they have a nice beer garden food area ,however we didn't eat",
          "A must visit place in Stuttgart, from 7 to 70 there is something to enjoy. You will have a smile on your face all day. There are literally 50,000+ example of all types of pigs, ornaments, toys, facts about pigs, fascinating. Plus there is a great beer garden where to relax and",
          "I would recommend to everybody. So many pigs to see, all colors, styles and shapes. For all and young.",
          "This is a breath of fresh air, away from the big car museums but so much fun. There were all sorts of pig toys from all over the world. I recommend going there just to take a picture with the pig bus. Afterwards you can enjoy the wonderful outdoor restaurant.",
          "This place is weeeeeeird. There are just so many pig related items. It gets very strange. Pig erotica etc. But it's so strange you kind of have to see it.",
          "Every quirky swine item you can think of is here. From porcelain to plush, including an adults only risqu\u00e9 section. What a hoot! Glad we stopped to see it. It's part of the hop-on, hop-off bus itinerary. If you are also doing the Mercedes Benz Museum, do the Mercedes Benz",
          "The Schweine Museum is a nice restaurant in the location of the old \"Schlachthof\" (Slaughter house) in Stuttgart-Wangen. It offers a nice restaurant with a large beer garden and friendly and efficient staff. The menu includes local delicacies and regional food. I had their",
          "Nothing you would expect to see in Germany. It was fun and entertaining. Way too many pigs but very good to kill 1.5 to 2.5 hours. Restaurant is good with a very nice beer garden.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Weissenhof Estate (German:Wei\u00dfenhofsiedlung) is a housing estate built for the Deutscher Werkbund exhibition in Stuttgart in 1927. It was an international showcase of what later became known as the International style of architecture. Two of the buildings were designed by the French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier and these are now part of the World Heritage Site The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement, which was designated in 2016. The World Heritage Site consists of 17 separate sites in seven countries.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nThe estate was built for the  Deutscher Werkbund exhibition in 1927, and included twenty-one buildings comprising sixty dwellings, designed by seventeen European architects.  The German architect Mies van der Rohe was in charge of the project on behalf of the city, and it was he who selected the architects, budgeted and coordinated their entries, prepared the site, and oversaw construction.  Le Corbusier was awarded the two prime sites, facing the city, and by far the largest budget.\nThe twenty-one buildings vary slightly in form, consisting of terraced and detached houses and apartment buildings, and display a strong consistency of design.  What they have in common are their simplified facades, flat roofs used as terraces, window bands, open plan interiors, and the high level of prefabrication which permitted their erection in just five months.  All but two of the entries were white.  Bruno Taut had his entry, the smallest, painted in various colors.\nAdvertised as a prototype of future workers' housing, in fact each of these houses was customized and furnished on a budget far out of a normal worker's reach and with little direct relevance to the technical challenges of standardized mass construction.  The exhibition opened to the public on 23 July 1927, a year late, and drew large crowds.\n\n\n== Homes ==\n\nOf the original twenty-one buildings, eleven survive as of 2006. Bombing damage during World War II is responsible for the complete loss of the homes by Gropius, Hilberseimer, Bruno Taut, Poelzig, Max Taut (home 24), and D\u00f6cker. Another of Max Taut's homes (23) was demolished in the 1950s, as was Rading's.\n\n\n=== List of homes ===\n\n1-4: Ludwig Mies van der Rohe\n5-9: J.J.P. Oud\n10: Victor Bourgeois\nOriginally, the lot was to be built on by Adolf Loos, but he was scrapped from the list after run-ins with and criticism of the Werkbund. Instead, Bourgeois built a home that was more traditional than the planned design by Loos, which was to have an innovative relation between up and down. One unique feature is a wine cellar from gravel rather than concrete. The two-story family home was damaged during the war, and was turned into a two-family dwelling afterward.\n11 and 12: Adolf Gustav Schneck\n13-15: Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret\n16 and 17: Walter Gropius\n18: Ludwig Hilberseimer\nDesigned for a family of six, painted in light gray. For reasons of economy, Hilberseimer's planned sliding windows were replaced with cheaper, conventional ones\u2014when Hilberseimer visited the finished house, he did not recognize it. The building was destroyed in the war; a conventional home now occupies the plot.\n19: Bruno Taut\nTaut was part of the group on the recommendation of his older brother, Max Taut. House 19 is a single-family, two-story home with a basement, designed as a \"proletarian's home.\" His house was painted red, blue, and yellow, and was destroyed in the war.\n20: Hans Poelzig\nPoelzig's contribution is a single-family, two-story home with a winter garden and a sun terrace as prominent features. It was destroyed in the war.\n21 and 22: Richard D\u00f6cker\nD\u00f6cker was assigned two lots in van der Rohe's plan, between Rathenaustra\u00dfe and Bruckmannweg. He originally designed two connected homes, based on his belief in connections between buildings and spaces, but changed the plans after seeing that none of the other buildings on the estate were connected. Both were single-family homes, no. 22 with one and a half stories, including a garage (the only home on the estate with one). D\u00f6cker wanted brightly colored homes; what color they were painted can no longer be determined since both were destroyed completely in the war.\n23 and 24: Max Taut\n25: Adolf Rading\n26 and 27: Josef Frank\n28-30: Mart Stam\n31 and 32: Peter Behrens\n33: Hans Scharoun\nA much more curved design than the other (angular) buildings, Scharoun's is a single-family home with two stories and a basement.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNew Frankfurt, Frankfurt 1925-32\nBerlin Modernism Housing Estates, Berlin 1926\nBauhaus and its Sites in Weimar, Dessau and Bernau, 1923-1930\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement / UNESCO Official WebsiteOfficial website\nWeissenhofmuseum",

        "wiki": "The Mercedes-Benz Museum is an automobile museum in Stuttgart, Germany. It covers the history of the Mercedes-Benz brand and the brands associated with it. Stuttgart is home to the Mercedes-Benz brand and the international headquarters of Daimler AG.\n\n\n== The museum building ==\nThe current building, which stands directly outside the main gate of the Daimler factory in Stuttgart, was designed by UN Studio. It is based on a unique cloverleaf concept using three overlapping circles with the center removed to form a triangular atrium recalling the shape of a Wankel engine. The building was completed and opened on 19 May 2006. Architecture and exhibition concept are closely interwoven, as exhibition designer HG Merz had already been commissioned before the architecture competition in 2001.\n\nThe building's height and \"double helix\" interior were designed to maximise space, providing 16,500 square metres (178,000 sq ft) of exhibition space on a footprint of just 4,800 square metres (52,000 sq ft). The double helix also corresponds to the exhibition concept, which divides the museum into the \"legend rooms\" and the \"collections\", offering two alternative tours that can be merged at any given point of the museum.\nThe museum contains more than 160 vehicles, some dating back to the very earliest days of the motorcar engine. The vehicles are maintained by the Mercedes-Benz Classic Centre of Fellbach. Previously, the museum was housed in a dedicated building within the factory complex and visitors had in recent decades been transported from the main gate by a secured shuttle.\n\n\n== Other details ==\nThe museum provides visitors with free audio tours in a variety of languages. In 2007, the museum was visited by 860,000 people.Visitors are also offered the opportunity to take a tour of the nearby Untert\u00fcrkheim engine factory. The factory produces many of the company's diesel engines.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nAutomuseum Dr. Carl Benz\nList of automobile museums\nMercedes-Benz World at Brooklands, UK\nMuseum for Historical Maybach Vehicles\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBuy Me a Mercedes-Benz: The Book of the Museum.

          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Mercedes Benz museum. They have the world history written in English and German as you walk along the walls, with the cars displayed in middle. There is hand sanitizer everywhere, an audio translator is included 10\u20ac pp entrance fee (kids are",

          "The museum is a stunning building and on one side is a little amphitheater (seating around 100 persons I think) which for several weeks in July and August is used as an open-air cinema. Great setting and excellent sound quality - we saw Bohemian Rhapsody and at some point I",
          "An amazing museum for anyone interested in the history and development of one of the world's most greatest vehicle manufacturers. General history of German and other industrialised nations history over the late 19th and 20th centuries was fascinating addition to motoring",

          "Overall really enjoyed this. I accompanied my husband and surprised myself that I appreciated the cars and historical information. We could have spent longer than the 6 hours we did spend. My feedback would be to have more opportunities for interaction. Why not provide stools or",
          "a very nice way to spend the time if jn Sttutgart. the museum is easily accessible and it is a great experience. the audio guide is quite good in giving information about what is on display and the history behind it. definitely recommend it",

          "We read many times that this was the best car museum in the world. While we have not visited all the car museums worldwide, this was the best one we have ever seen. Whether you are a fan of Mercedes cars or not (we are...), it is a must to see. We had actually added Stuttgart to",

          "If you\u2019re a Mercedes lover like me then you\u2019ll love this museum that takes you from the start of Mercedes till now. At the same time you\u2019ll learn a lot about the history of Mercedes and how it was founded. I used the translation headphones that were great:",
          "This museum does not expect you to be a car fan or a Mercedes-Benz fan, rather than curious about the history of the 20th century and how one of the most important inventions of all time - the engine - influenced its course. In combination of all that, one can't, of course,",
          "Loved this museum - a quirky concrete building yet well laid out. From the first engine and car onwards. Loved celebrity cars and the audio-visual was good. My only niggle was not knowing whether to go left or right when moving between floors. Berthas restaurant is to be",
          "Museum was great. Lots of exhibits, very informative. Also very good cafe with beer. Allow a full day because you spend 1/2 a day just waiting in line to get inside. Almost worth the wait.",

          "Wow. Mercedes has spared no expense with this amazing museum. It is worth coming to Stuttgart just to experience it. For starters, the architecture of the museum itself is incredible. I am sure you could take a tour just covering the architecture of the building. It is",
          "We took two tickets for 20 eur. Yoy are passing floor by floor filled by mercedes exponats from beggining of their existence. I saw the BMW museum in Munchen, but this one is better from my point of view.",
          "Excellent. Its a must even if you are not a big fan of Mercedes Benz. Need to spend 120-180 mins at least. Loads to see, it\u2019s like time travel from 1886 to the future.",
          "This was the highlight of our visit to Stuttgart. I will be back as the 3 hours we had available for this visit, was not nearly enough. There is just so much detail and history to go through and absorb - a truly magnificent place where you leave much better informed and inspired.",
          "Along with the beautiful Mercedes cars and other vehicles you will get good info about innovation, but of history. Keep good amount of time to explore this place",
          "Excellent museum that showcases the history of Mercedes Benz starting from 1880s. Plenty of vehicles/parts of all ages on display. It will require at least one day to really enjoy the museum if you are a real car crazy person. They have restaurants also(didn't try that option).",
          "I had wanted to go for at least last 2 years but been busy. Finally I took the time to go. It was a great and so much better than I thought it would be. The whole history of the motor car. How it evolved right up to modern day cars. Fantastic place and good for families.",
          "Nice place and way of presenting the history, amazing vehicles. It could have more high tech stuff, not so much history of current days or future",

          "I am a Mercedes-Benz fan but this museum just felt really long and dragged out. While they tried to take you through the full journey of their story there were just tons of cars and text and long stair cases they kept taking down through time but it didn't have any thing that",
          "Amazing collection of the history of the car manufacturer Daimler Benz. Well explained with audio guides during the tour of the museum. Architectural the building is also very interesting. A gem for every car enthusiast.",
          "Amazing design and many exhibits to marvel at. However, the kid (5 years) got a bit bored after a while. The activities for young children is not satisfactory. Then again, most museums have that problem. The cars on display are terrific and the history lessons while walking down",

          "Till you actually get there it\u2019s difficult to imagine the magnitude of this museum. It\u2019s simply fantastic, beautiful and for a very affordable price. Love cars, go there.",
          "Seeing that the Mercedes-Benz Museum is the #1 rated attraction on TripAdvisor and with so many posts saying that it's a must-see even if you're not a car enthusiast, I decided to visit. My thoughts: - Incredible building. The architecture is what I enjoyed most about the",
          "Had a few hours to kill on arrival to Stuttgart so decided to explore the museum. It was mid week, there was no crowds no queuing, was very easy to take photo. The exhibits are mainly touchable you really do get close. Price is reasonable. There are a few cafes which again I was",
          "OK. Easy to find from the S bahn. Walk is about 750 metres, nicely signposted. Impressive purpose built building. Start at the top via a lift and wander down. Notv sure about the overtly politically correct history lining the walls. But I was there to see truly classic",
          "The story of Merc from first car right (as the dawn of motoring) right up to date, including both road cars and motorsport. Very interesting. Highly recommended.",

          "Great museum to come and visit. Enjoyed the current G Wagon exhibition. Something on every level that each visitor will like.",
          "Yes, first time visiting this Museum. Expected to see many Mercedes Benz cars, and I did. But that was not all. The building is an impressive one. The history of Mercedes Benz was as impressive and beautifully presented as the building. But it was not only the history of",
          "We visited the museum 25th October in the afternoon. Unfortunately, there was a large event in the evening (Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the year 2019). Due to this event, a large part of the lower floor was closed. There was a lot of pressure to get everybody out at 18h00.",
          "I'm not even a fan of cars etc, but I think the experience is quite immersive. You get to learn a lot about German History from an industrial point of view, also what Mercedez Benz was up to during WW2. Really cool and the building is fun.",
          "Having been to the Porsche museum first as that brand owner we felt a bit unsure about the Mercedes Benz one but as a car lover its a must and great architecture building. Its has it all including some interactive bits which my 12 yr old son loved. The website gives you all the",
          "Great visit, verry well setup including explanations. We loved the cars in the exposition, especially the proto types.",
          "You'd be crazy not to visit here if you are a car lover. Even if you just want to learn about cars and history, or just see how magnificent a museum can be, visit here. It is accessible on public transport from the main part of the city. Inside is a multi-story extravaganza of",

          "For a true car buff this is a great museum. True history of a ground zero to current auto manufacturer. Didn't realize how tied into German history this company was. I was there for over 4 hours and loved it but the non auto enthusiast it may become overwhelming. Displays",
          "We visited this magnificently designed museum today - well worth the visit. It is more than a car museum- I like how it track significant world events since the 1880s - and their impact on Germany and the Benz and Daimler Organisation. Highly recommended.",
          "I highly recommend a visit to this museum if you are into cars. They have made the tours really interesting and the history of the company itself is interesting",

          "This place is amazing. Don't worry if you don't particularly like cars (I do) as this is a history museum covering world events, music - everything is covered but in the context of the history of Daimler-Benz. I just can't say enough good things about this place. I am an art",
          "This museum is very interactive compared to most museums. I really enjoyed the way the museum was designed in order to easily guide your way through the museum. When you first start your way into the museum, you are given a device similarly alike to an iPhone and earphone",

          "I was reluctant to go as I\u2019m not into cars, but I\u2019m so glad I did. This is a beautiful well designed building that showcases not only the journey of Daimler and Mercedes-Benz over the years, but the history of the evolution of the automobile in relation to the history of the",
          "A great morning spent here - so much to see and enjoy. Learnt a lot that didn\u2019t know and saw lots of vehicles that were very different and some that were for sale, vintage, worth a fortune!",
          "This is more than an homage to the Daimler-Benz and Mercedes marques, it is a history of the development of the motor car and its place in the social history of Germany and to some respects Europe. The exhibition is over 7 floors accessible by a spiral walkway and lifts. So",
          "Absolutely fabulous. Would certainly recommend. The layout is excellent. Very easy to get around. Great selection of vehicles. Lots of written information and interesting historical facts.",
          "Building is designed by a Dutch architect. You a brought to the top floor by a very 'spacy-designed' elevator. Walking down, you travel through Mercedes rich history. A real treat for petrol heads and Mercedes fans.",

          "As a Mercedes fan, this museum was incredible. The many levels tell a story in history of the revolution of the Mercedes benz along the walls are pictures of other major worldly events that were taking place at the same time. The gift shop has plenty to offer. The showroom is a",
          "Mercedes really have done a brilliant job here, the museum runs in a chronological order and you are transported from start to finish of the Mercedes journey. The audio system helps you understand each and every car and element of the brand and it really is pristine.",
          "On a day when I was comimg with my friends entry was free, usually costs 10\u20ac, but of course it's not too much to visit most popular cars industry museum",
          "Unique integration of form, structure, and content. The museum is really a masterpiece of architecture, and with its continuous walkways, you can explore and enjoy the world of the legendary car brand. It uses new technologies to present the contents.",

          "Loved the museum. You have to zigzag if you want to see everything. There was a special exhibition but we did not see it. Anyway it is really nice to see it and follow the history of this high end brand.",
          "Great day with friends at the museum, a lot to see and very stylish. It was nice to see how organized and smart all is made.",
          "If you love car and Mercedes Benz in particular, this is a must place to visit when you are in Stuttgart Germany. You will love this place.",
          "Upon entry, you note that its not as modern as the Porsche Museum. But it is laid out extremely well. Mercedes just has much more history to cover than Porsche, as well as, as wider range of products. Porsche was about racing. MB has its racing aspect for sure, which is at the",
          "The museum is easy to get to, just a 7-10 minute walk from the nearest strain station. The museum is very laid out and cars displayed very well. The historical information displayed between the different levels is also very interesting. A must for car enthusiasts.",
          "Wow! What an amazing Museum. We loved it. Well presented, amazing detail and a fantastic history of Mercedes Motor Cars. Plenty of social history too. Clever planning to finish with old Collectors' Carsthat were actually for sale! Then the current showroom of new cars. Souvenir",
          "We visited this museum purely because we were staying in a hotel across the road and had a day free. So glad we did as this is probably the best museum I\u2019ve been too. The building itself is magnificent. The museum is so well laid out. We went for a guided tour, which I think",
          "I think this museum is great or why you will say that the cars in it take you back to the old times very nice",
          "I think Germany is the best place to visit this is the reason why you can see the development of cars starting from the top and going down to the bottom floor",

          "I had great expectations about this visit as it was one of the main attractions in Stuttgart. First of all, the staff at the reception wasn\u2019t friendly Moreover, they refused to give audio guide to my son, 7 years old. When I insisted, they gave it in another language...",
          "For the fans of Mercedes benz this is a must visit. The museum is quite big around 8 floors and it documents the history of automobiles till now. You can see models of almost all different types of vehicles from Mercedes.",
          "The entire museum is state of the art and handicap friendly. It is more than an auto museum, it\u2019s a historic walk through time since the invention of the automobile. All those events involving an auto are there. I highly recommend more than a simple hour or so, it really takes",

          "Visiting with kids (2 and 5 years), I would have wanted more cars where you can go to sit inside. September 2019 we found only a bus and a garbage truck, and kids absolutely loved them, but there could have been more. There could also be a good restaurant in the museum, as there are no restaurants in the near area with easy parking.",
          "History and cars collides in ana amazing 8-store building to show how the company began.\nAlmost 3 hs to see it all with a low pace. Many things to read and watch.\nAn audio guide is included in the price.",

Similarly for the invention of the supercharger. Nicely cooled environment and no climbing (up) of stairs.  Skip the usual gift shop junk and walk ahead to buy a new Mercedes instead.",

        "wiki": "Stuttgart Neckarpark station is in the German city of Stuttgart and is located at the chainage of 5.6 kilometres (measured from Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof) on the Fils Valley Railway and is a station on the network of the Stuttgart S-Bahn.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cannstatter Wasen (\"Cannstatt grass\") has been a fairground and exhibition area since the 19th century. In 1928 the city of Stuttgart exchanged land on the Wasen owned by the State of Wurttemberg with land in the district of Burgholzhof in northwestern Bad Cannstatt. It intended to create a major new stadium on the site, which served as a training ground among other things. The link to the new sports facility proved to be a problem, because neither Cannstatt station nor Untert\u00fcrkheim station were close enough for visitors.\nKarl Schaechterle of the Railway Administration of Stuttgart (German: Reichsbahndirektion Stuttgart) planned a new station for special trains on the Fils Valley line, the Wasen station. In addition to the suburban platforms on the Fils Valley tracks, a platform would also be built on the long-distance tracks. A low platform would be built for trains running on the Schuster Railway (Schusterbahn) from Kornwestheim. Trains coming from Waiblingen would run on the Rems Railway curve towards Untert\u00fcrkheim freight yard to reach the station. Another platform was later located there to provide for commuting to Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (central station). Schaechterle could not implement his plan, however, as the Deutsche Reichsbahn rejected it.\nDeutsche Bundesbahn drew up fresh plans for a station at Neckarstadion (Neckar Stadium) in the 1960s. Since planning for the Stuttgart S-Bahn was already under consideration, providing a stop for long-distance trains on the Fils Valley railway was not envisaged.\nSince 1978, S-Bahn line S 1 services have run between Schwabstra\u00dfe and Plochingen. The possibility of a building a new S-Bahn station near the stadium was considered. Studies conducted in 1979 by transport planners found a positive result for the proposal. The way was now clear for the establishment of Neckarstadion station on Alten Untert\u00fcrkheimer Stra\u00dfe (street) and it was inaugurated on 29 September 1984.\nIn addition to the Neckarstadion, the station was near the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle (indoor arena) and the Daimler-Benz plant at Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nAfter the Neckarstadion was renamed, the station was renamed Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion station. To handle the many visitors at major events, the station has had another track and a lift since July 2005.\nThe opening of the Mercedes-Benz Museum in May 2006 increased the importance of the station. A sign reading \"Mercedes-Benz Museum\" was added to the station sign. In 2008, the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion was renamed Mercedes-Benz Arena. It was decided to rename the station with its current name, not only to refer to the stadium, but to the entire events area. To distinguish it from the Stuttgart Stadtbahn station of Neckarpark (Stadion), the S-Bahn station was named Neckarpark (Mercedes-Benz) in 2008, but the advertising contract with Mercedes-Benz expired on 1 August 2014 and was not renewed, so it is now again called Stuttgart Neckarpark.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe station is on line S 1 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn. Platform track 1 is used by the S-Bahn services to Bad Cannstatt. Track 2 is used by S-Bahn services to Esslingen. Track 3 is used by special services only. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station.\n\n\n=== S-Bahn ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nAndreas M. R\u00e4ntzsch (1987).

          "Because we did not have a reservation for a table in Munich, we decided to go to the Cannstatter Wasen in Stuttgart. Here too, the earlier you book the table, the better! The party is just crazy, even though it already closes at 11pm or midnight. Thus, make sure to go early",

          "Attending the Cannstattter Wassen was one of the HIGHLIGHTS of our trip through Germany. The character of this fair-beer garden mash-up was incredible. It was so much fun trying the delicious beers on tap at the various stands, interacting with locals decked out in their",

          "After the Oktoberfest in Munich this one is the second largest beerfest. And actually I like it more. Not only because i live quite close and can take the s-cbahn home :-) but also because its possible to go there on weekends and your still able to enter the beer tents.",
          "Oktoberfest is no different....well, except that THIS is better! Stuttgart holds theirs twice a year & has some of the most intense rides I have ever seen! The tents are incredible! If you ever have a chance to go...do it! I have some of my favorite memories in those tents,",
          "I like the carnival atmosphere but was put off by the riotus drinking",
          "This event is great fun, from the long fancy beer tents with the live music and large beer glasses. To the fun fair that surrounds the tents with even more food and lively side shows. This is a great well organised event well worth the experience.",
          "While living in Germany for some years, we would never miss the Canstatter Wasen - it is an absolute must while in Germany. Millions of tourists flock to Germany in October just to attend the Wasen and with good reason - there are loads of big tents with German folk music,",
          "Visted this festival in May with 20 work colleagues who came from around the globe so it was a first for almost everybody. It was organized by our German branch so as one would imagine it went like clockwork. It was unusually hot outside so the beer tent ( capacity 3000) reached",
          "If you are in the area during the Spring or Fall Festivals (Fruhlingsfest or Volksfest) then please go here and get an authentic taste of Festival fun! I rate it as better than Oktoberfest for the type of people in the crowds, the food choices and quality and the more intimate",
          "We went there with the kids to Fruehlingsfest. Expect to pay, pay, pay big bucks (or Euro). It is a lot of fun but I was dissappointed that the Sping Fest was the same set up as the Winterfest (Stutggart's Oktoberfest) with the same rides, same high prices, and same tents.",
          "More fun than Oktberfest in Munich because it is so so big or crowded. Avoid on weekend nights though.",
          "Less tourists. Same giant beer halls. Stuttgart has a bierfest in the Spring, Fruhlingsfest, and Fall, Volksfest. The bavarian costumes have even become more popular the last three years. What fun!",
          "Great atmosphere, great food, good beer, happy people - you can not leave this bierfest without a smile on your face. Much better than the equivalent Oktoberfest in Munich, the Wasen is more traditional but is still very doable for tourists. There are two versions of it - one",
          "I have been to this fest 3 times and it is by far better than the Oktoberfest in Munich. I say this because I have also been to that fest a few times as well. The difference is the ability to get an actual beer. In Munich you must be in a tent and have a table to sit at to get a",
          "We arrived in Germany too late for Oktoberfest, so we opted to take in this festival instead. We were not disappointed. My husband really enjoyed touring the beer tents, and I loved wandering through the rides and food stands. There's no admission fee to enter the fest, you only",
          "If you are in Stuttgart in the spring or fall no trip is complete without a visit to the traditional Cannstatter Volkesfest. Everyone has heard of the Oktoberfest but that is too touristy four my taste the fest to come back to year after year is the Cannstatter Volkesfest. Even",

        "wiki": "The State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart (German: Staatliches Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Stuttgart), abbreviated SMNS, is one of the two state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's natural history museums. Together with the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe (Staatliches Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Karlsruhe) it is one of the most important repositories for state-owned natural history collections.\nExhibitions are shown in two buildings, both situated in the Rosenstein park in Stuttgart: the L\u00f6wentor Museum (German: Museum am L\u00f6wentor) houses the paleontology and geology exhibitions, while the Museum Rosenstein in Rosenstein Palace focuses on biology and natural history. Every year, the SMNS is visited by about 110,000 people.\n\n\n== History ==\nPrior to World War II, the natural history collection of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg was located at the Neckarstra\u00dfe in downtown Stuttgart. A part of the exhibits were destroyed during the war, when the original building was destroyed by fire after Allied bombing. Luckily, most of the exhibits were sourced out and survived the war. Some specimens were also recovered form the rubble of the destroyed old museum building, including a spectacular plesiosaur today mounted in 3D in the L\u00f6wentor Museum exhibition.\nThe biological specimens of the State's collection are displayed at the castle Rosenstein since 1954. For the paleontological collection, the construction of a new exhibition building began in 1981 and was finished in 1985.\nThe principal exhibition area of L\u00f6wentor Museum consists of a single room, made up of three floors and over 3500 square meters (37'600 square feet) of exhibition area. The room has a height of up to 11 meters.\n\n\n== Permanent exhibition ==\nThe Museum am L\u00f6wentor exhibition focuses mainly on fossils from its home state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in southwestern Germany, and other localities in Germany. The state is rich in fossils, including several famous classical localities. Especially well exposed are terrestrial and marine Triassic, marine Jurassic and terrestrial Cenozoic sediments. Therefore, the museum exhibits the early prosauropod dinosaur Plateosaurus and other terrestrial animals from the Lower and Upper Triassic (Buntsandstein and Keuper, respectively), a wide range of marine fossils, mainly invertebrates, from the Muschelkalk, and a plethora of ichthyosaurs, pliosaurs and plesiosaurs, as well as sharks from the Posidonia Shale and other Lower Jurassic formations. Furthermore, exquisite Jurassic ammonites and other invertebrates are shown in large numbers.\nThe Cenozoic is represented by invertebrates and mainly vertebrates from various German localities, including a pleistocene elephant and a copy of a mammuth mummy. Also on exhibit is the skull of the prehistoric man of Steinheim (Homo steinheimensis).\nThe museum also houses a spectacular collection of plant and animal fossils in amber.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Germany\nList of natural history museums\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in German)\n\n\n== References ==\nPart of this article was translated from the German Wikipedia article (June 20, 2009), version [1].",

        "wiki": "The Linden Museum (German: Linden-Museum Stuttgart. Staatliches Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde) is an ethnological museum located in Stuttgart, Germany. The museum features cultural artifacts from around the world, including South and Southeast Asia, Africa, the Islamic world from the Near East to Pakistan, China and Japan, and artifacts from North and Latin America and Oceania.\nThe museum traces its origins to the collection of objects amassed by the Verein f\u00fcr Handelsgeographie (Association for Trade Geography) in the 19th century. The namesake of the museum is Karl Graf von Linden (1838\u20131910) who, as president of the Stuttgart Verein f\u00fcr Handelsgeographie, took an interest in assembling and organizing the collection, and invited explorers of the caliber of Sven Hedin and Roald Amundsen to Stuttgart.\nIn 1911, the collection was established as a private museum and its current building was constructed. After suffering extensive damage during World War II, the building was restored in the 1950s and the municipality became its custodian. Since 1973, the museum has been jointly administrated by the city of Stuttgart and the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nLinden-Museum Stuttgart at Google Cultural Institute\n\n\n== References ==",

          "most information was in German. There's an audioguide, but I'd have rather read more information, at least, in English. However, everything looked very interesting.",

          "Interesting collection, the Afrcan collection was closed when I got there but the rest was very interesting. All pieces had a good explanation(only in german). The museum made some displays of an afghan bazar, japanese thouse, etc what brings the collection more to life.",

        "wiki": "Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof is the primary railway station in the city of Stuttgart, the state capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in southwestern Germany. It is the largest regional and long-distance railway station in Stuttgart, the main node of the Stuttgart S-Bahn network, and, together with the station at Charlottenplatz, it is the main node of the Stuttgart Stadtbahn.\nLocated at the northeastern end of the K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, the main pedestrian zone of the city centre, the main line station is a terminus, whilst the subterranean S-Bahn and Stadtbahn stations are through-stations. The station is well known for its 12-storey tower with a large, rotating and illuminated Mercedes-Benz star insignia on top; the tower and station building are city landmarks.\nPlans for the controversial Stuttgart 21 project to convert the main line terminus station into an underground through station include the demolition of the side wings of the building, together with the elimination of the platforms, tracks, and apron of the terminus station.  The planned underground through station is configured at a 90-degree angle to the present station.  Construction is scheduled from 2010 to 2019.\nIn November 2009, preservationists of the International Council on Monuments and Sites nominated the building for inclusion in UNESCO's World Cultural Heritage list, an occasion that opponents of the Stuttgart 21 project picked to urge the city and Deutsche Bahn to stop the project which implies demolition of parts of the complex designed by Paul Bonatz.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First and second Centralbahnhof ===\nUntil 1922, the central station (Centralbahnhof or Zentralbahnhof) was located on the Schlosstrasse (the precise location of the former station is on what is today called the Bolzstrasse), near the Schlossplatz. The first station building, a terminus station with 4 tracks, was built by Karl Etzel for the opening of the W\u00fcrttemberg Central Railway (Zentralbahn), with its two branches to Ludwigsburg and Esslingen.\nThe wooden station hall was not unusual at the time and covered four tracks. The first train, arrived at the station from Canstatt on 26 September 1846. The first phase of railway construction in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg, with routes to Heilbronn, Bretten, Ulm, and Friedrichshafen, was completed by 1854.\nDue to increasing railway traffic, the first building was replaced by new construction at the same spot in the 1860s.  Between 1863 and 1867, the engineers Klein, Georg Morlok, Carl Julius Abel and later city architect Adolf Wolff created this second station, with 8 tracks, featuring a building with grandiose arches in the Renaissance Revival style. Parts of the fa\u00e7ade of this building are now part of the Metropol, an events centre and cinema complex.\n\n\n=== Sprickerhof through station ===\nWith a steadily increasing traffic volume and the connection of additional lines, the station had increasingly reached its capacity limits in the early 20th century.By 1905, there were three designs for the redevelopment of the station:\nthe so-called Sprickerhofsche Durchgangsbahnhof (Sprickerhof through station),\na terminal station on Bolzstra\u00dfe (then Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe), and\na terminal station on Schillerstra\u00dfe.The concept of Sprickerhof through station was introduced in 1901. The G\u00e4u Railway and the line from Feuerbach were to run through the Kriegsberg (a hill to the northwest of the current station) to the central station in three parallel twin-track tunnels at a gradient of 1:100 from Wolframstra\u00dfe in an arc with a radius of 300 metres. This would have run to Bahnhofstra\u00dfe via Kriegsbergstra\u00dfe and the tracks would have been in the area of the road to Ludwigsburg. The crossover tracks would have run into the tunnel for about 150 metres. The entrance building would have been built in the area of the main customs office. The above-ground areas between Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe and Schillerstra\u00dfe would have been demolished for this project. A commission of external experts opposed the project.\n\n\n=== The current Hauptbahnhof ===\n\nThe present Hauptbahnhof was built between 1914 and 1928 on the street now called Arnulf-Klett-Platz, only about 500 metres east of the former station.\nIn 1910, the Royal W\u00fcrttemberg State Railways (K\u00f6niglich W\u00fcrttembergischen Staats-Eisenbahnen or K.W.St.E.) financed an architectural contest, which drew 70 participants. The competition was won by the architects Paul Bonatz and Friedrich Eugen Scholer with their plans for umbilicus sueviae\u2014the Navel of Swabia. After undergoing numerous changes, including moving the station tower from the main fa\u00e7ade to the wing at the Schlossgarten, construction began in 1914 on Cannstatter Strasse. Changes to the plan also occurred in the construction phase. Due to the route of the tracks to the old station, construction needed to be done in two phases, with the first stage, including tracks 9 to 16, going into service on 22 October 1922. The tracks to the old station were cut at the same time.\nAs further construction of the new station was delayed for financial reasons, the city of Stuttgart loaned Deutsche Reichsbahn two million Reichsmark (equivalent in current values to \u20ac7.2 million) in 1925 and a further loan of 5 million Reichsmark (equivalent to \u20ac16.7 million) in 1927. The second stage was completed in 1928 and the electrification of the 16 tracks was completed on 15 May 1933.\nIn the bombing of Stuttgart in the Second World War, the Hauptbahnhof was severely damaged several times, although from 1940 to 1942 a decoy target at Lauffen am Neckar diverted many raids. The reconstruction took several years. Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof has been listed as a cultural heritage site of special significance (under section 12 of the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg heritage protection act) since 20 August 1987.\n\n\n=== S-Bahn and Stadtbahn ===\nA plan developed in the mid-1950s for a S-Bahn proposed a four-track station with two 175-metre-long island platforms under the Hauptbahnhof, which would be linked by two tracks towards the city centre and four towards Feuerbach/Bad Cannstatt.Between 1971 and 1978, an underground Hauptbahnhof station was built for the S-Bahn in the central Neckar area, which was a cut-and-cover construction under the main hall in the area of the small ticket hall. This station has two tracks and an island platform. The first S-Bahn services ran on 1 October 1978.\nAfter four years of planning, construction commenced on a new central signalling centre of class SpDrL 60 at the Hauptbahnhof on 3 October 1973. The signalling infrastructure was gradually put into operation: first for the train depot on 1 and 2 October 1977, then for the passenger station and freight yard on 5 and 6 November 1977 respectively. The S-Bahn connecting line was opened as far as the former terminus at Schwabstra\u00dfe on 1 October 1978.\nA total of 95 stop signals, 93 distant signals, 583 shunting signals, 506 point machines, 530 track circuits and 169 axle counters were integrated into the track layout. The new signalling centre replaced twelve old signal boxes. DM 68 million was spent on the signalling centre and its outdoor facilities. Today, five to seven dispatchers work in the signalling centre.The underground Stadtbahn station, called Hauptbahnhof (Arnulf-Klett-Platz), in front of the station hall under Arnulf-Klett-Platz was opened to traffic on 9 April 1976. Today, ten Stuttgart Stadtbahn lines serve the station.\nThe S-Bahn station was used (as of 1993) by about 120,000 passengers per day. This included 55,000 transfers to long-distance, regional and Stadtbahn services, about 15,000 passengers transferring between the S-Bahn lines via Feuerbach and Bad Cannstatt and around 50,000 passengers entering or exiting at the station. The Stadtbahn station was used by around 75,000 passengers a day. In 2016, 140,000 passengers used the S-Bahn station each day. With the commissioning of Stuttgart 21, the volume is expected to decline by about 20 percent. The S-Bahn station is called Stuttgart Hbf tief (deep) and is 20 m below the  Hauptbahnhof.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nThe station building consists of cubes nested symmetrically and asymmetrically. It is characterised by cubes of different size, dimension and design. Concrete and steel were used during the construction of the station building and the rough-hewn Muschelkalk (\"mussel chalk\") blocks were laid as a facade over bricks. The Muschelkalk comes from the Trochitenkalk Formation of the Upper Muschelkalk from the Crailsheim area. Inside, sandstone, tuff and brick dominate the walls. These are partly designed as flat wooden ceilings and partly designed as reinforced concrete structures. The pillars in the terminal station hall are made of exposed concrete.\nThe station is also integrated into the urban planning of the city of Stuttgart. The structure adapts to the sloping terrain (there is a difference in height of almost five metres between the tower and the north exit). The original plans called for a road leading directly to the building, but Bonatz eliminated this in favour of the Lautenschlagerstra\u00dfe, as it is now known, which ends at the Kleine Schalterhalle (small ticket hall). The tracks for the local commuter traffic are behind this hall and the central exit is between the hall and the main building, which is useful for the control of passenger flow. Underneath the tracks area, three tunnels running at right angles to the tracks provide highly functional access points: the mail tunnel runs from the post office annex to the northwestern station area, a passenger tunnel eases the task of changing platforms and a third tunnel is meant for the transit of express freight.\nThe construction has some highly regarded features. The fa\u00e7ade is made of limestone, which was covered with bricks; on the inside, sandstone, tuff, and bricks form the walls. The roof structures consist partly of flat wood and partly of reinforced concrete panels. The use of exposed concrete on the pillars lends a modern flair to the main hall. The structure features conservative elements, shown in the monumentality and the reserved decorations, as well as progressive elements, as shown by the flat roof structures, for example. The design is considered an important example of the Stuttgart School.\nChristoph Ingenhoven, the architect of the new station, expressed the opinion that much of Bonatz's original visions, which tended towards \"a knight's castle or Valhalla\", can still be found in the current building. The Stuttgart Regional Court, in its decision to permit the demolition of the side wings, stated that only the terminal train shed, the tower, the ticket halls and the portico were decisive for the architectural recognition of the work, but not the side wings.\n\n\n=== Tracks and platforms ===\n\nSince the existing tracks to the old station continued in use until the commissioning of the new one, the competition plan proposed, at the suggestion of the Generaldirektion der Staats-Eisenbahnen (General Headquarters of the State Railways), the building of a three-span train shed. This plan was later changed to low canopies over each  platforms with slots above the tracks to allow smoke to escape and the roof supports were placed on the luggage platforms. Due to the shortage of materials after the First World War, the canopies planned for tracks 1 to 16 were not executed in steel, but in wood. After the destruction in the Second World War, new canopies were built on reinforced concrete bases. During the construction of the ramp for the Stuttgart S-Bahn from 1971 to 1974, tracks 1 to 3 were not available and a platform was built on track 1a as a replacement. In preparation for the Stuttgart 21 project, the platforms were extended towards the track apron from May 2010 and track 1a was removed in September 2010.\nServices on lines S1 to S6 and S60 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn stop on two tracks (tracks 101 and 102) in the underground S-Bahn station (third basement). Southbound S-Bahn services towards Schwabstra\u00dfe and the airport stop on track 101, while northbound services towards Bad Cannstatt and Stuttgart North stop on 102.\nThe track apron connects five tracks of the regional and long-distance traffic (one track towards the G\u00e4u Railway and two tracks each towards Bad Cannstatt and Feuerbach) with the station tracks; five further tracks connect the station with the storage facility at Rosenstein Park. The set of tracks is protected as an object of cultural heritage under the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg heritage act, although this protection will be removed after the completion of Stuttgart 21.The necessary flying junctions were built according to plans by Karl Schaechterle between 1908 and 1914. At the opening of the station, it had two dispatcher's signal boxes: Signal box 1 provided routings for tracks 1 to 4 to and from the suburban tracks to Cannstatt and for tracks 4 to 7 to and from the suburban tracks to Feuerbach. Signal box 2 provided routings for the tracks for long-distance traffic. Entry and exit of trains to the G\u00e4u Railway and their exit to the mainline tracks to Feuerbach was possible from tracks 7 to 12. The entrance of trains from the long-distance tracks from Cannstatt was possible on tracks 8 to 13. The entrance of long-distance services from Feuerbach and the exit of long-distance services to Cannstatt was possible on tracks 12 to 16. In addition, there were other signal boxes for connecting to the storage yard (signal boxes 3 and 5) and the freight yard (signal box 4).In 1977, the signal boxes were replaced by a central signalling centre to the south of track 16. Since then there have been standard routes to and from the S-Bahn tracks to Bad Cannstatt from tracks 1 to 6 as well as from and to the S-Bahn tunnel and Zuffenhausen from and to tracks 3 to 12. Entrance from the mainline tracks from Zuffenhausen to tracks 3 to 16 is possible, as is exit towards Zuffenhausen from tracks 3 to 12. Moves from the long-distance tracks from Bad Cannstatt can continue to tracks 12 to 16 and entrances from those tracks is possible to tracks 8 to 13 across the tracks.Altogether Stuttgart station has over 140 kilometres of railway tracks and 385 sets of points on 82 hectares of land.The aboveground platforms are 76 centimetres-high and usually 8.45 metres-wide and have lengths varying between 326 metres  (platforms 7, 13 and 14) and 470 metres (platforms 8, 15 and 16). The S-Bahn platform  (tracks 101/102) is 96 centimetres high and 280 metres-long.The underground S-Bahn station is preceded by a 700-metre-long ramp on a 3.2 percent grade, which passes under the track and platform facilities of the main station over a length of around 500 metres.\n\n\n=== Station tower ===\n\nThe 56 metre-high station tower is a landmark of the city of Stuttgart\nand marks the end of K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe. It is founded on 288\u2013290 piles with a length of between 10 and 11 metres. It is disputed whether the piles are made of reinforced concrete or oak, but Deutsche Bahn refused to commission test bores, as according to a report the station tower stands on reinforced concrete piles and the resolution of the issue has no decisive importance for the construction of Stuttgart 21. When completed in 1916, the tower only provided a restaurant on the top floor and a waiting room for King William II. In 1926, the caf\u00e9 run by Eugen B\u00fcrkle (with a boardroom, tea room, wine bar, dining room and rooftop restaurant) was advertised with the slogan \"The most beautiful station restaurant rooms in Germany\". After the Second World War, when the tower suffered little damage, a rotating Mercedes star with a diameter of five metres was installed on the turret roof in 1952 and still marks the building's silhouette. The advertising revenue was used for the reconstruction of the station. From 1955 to 1976, the station tower was used as a hotel and at times as accommodation for rail employees. The Turmforum (tower forum) Stuttgart 21 project information display has been established on four levels since 1998. The Stuttgart-Mitte registry office has carried out marriages in the conference room on level 9 since 2000. In addition, a bistro and a viewing terrace (lift and entrance free) is located in the tower. The tower clock has a dial with a diameter of five and a half metres.\n\n\n=== Terminal station hall ===\n\nThe terminal station hall connects directly to the cross-platform hall at the end of platforms tracks 1 to 16. The terminal station hall was built with a reinforced concrete wall on the side near the platforms to reduce the effects of a possible brake failure. The eight arches leading to the cross-platform hall are divided into three parts: at the top they each have a window forming a round arch, the middle parts that are at the level of the platform canopies are solid and are built to full width in their lower parts, while at the bottom of each arch there is a passage to the cross-platform hall, which originally had a platform gate. A similar arrangement can be found on the opposite side, towards the city. The original ceiling was destroyed during the Second World War and the current ceiling was completed in 1950.Originally there were waiting rooms and restaurants, separated by class, between the small and large ticket halls on the side facing away from the tracks. Some of the 40 shops and catering services that are now occupy the station were inserted in the terminal station hall, while the others are accessible from it. The building ends with an arcade to Arnulf-Klett-Platz.\n\nA raised wire cage has been erected in the hall as a dovecote that serves to limit the propagation of feral pigeons.\nIn the course of the Stuttgart 21 project, the passageways that now lead to the cross-platform hall are to be closed by a glass structure, but the basic tripartite division of the round arches is to be retained. On the side facing the city, the wall panels in the middle of the arches are to be partially removed in order to illuminate the offices behind. Two future staircases and three skylights are to be created for the distribution level below the aboveground station hall so that the station hall will remain \"accessible and experienceable.\" However, with the loss of its current function, it will also lose some of its significance.\n\n\n==== North exit ====\n\nThe north exit connects the terminal station hall with Friedrichstra\u00dfe (the B 27); until 2012 it was the only barrier-free access to the station. Originally, the station forecourt, which had a pavilion in the centre, lay in front of the north exit; it was later used as a parking area and included an access to the passage under Arnulf-Klett-Platz. From the summer of 2012 to October 2013, the north exit was closed and the direct access to the Klett passage could not be used as the engineering\nbuilding for the Stuttgart 21 project was being built there. The parking area, which had also not been available since summer 2012, has been partly usable since mid-2014. Barrier-free access was only possible via a detour during the construction of the engineering building: a new passage was created on the northwest side on the side of the platforms, about 100 metres from the former north exit, which currently serves as another barrier-free access to the station.\nThe arch above the north exit reflects the design of the remaining arches of the terminal station hall.\n\n\n==== Small ticket hall ====\nThe small ticket hall is aligned with Lautenschlagerstra\u00dfe and the Zeppelin building, also designed by Bonatz and Scholer. The small ticket hall was originally designed for access to suburban services on tracks 1 to 6 and also offered access to the adjacent Reichsbahn Hotel (now the Intercity Hotel). The small ticket hall is now occasionally used for events, otherwise it is empty.\n\n\n==== Central exit ====\n\nThe central exit connects the terminal station hall with Arnulf-Klett-Platz. It is recessed behind the pillars of the arcades. In contrast to the clearly visible entrances, it is not visible from the outside. A W\u00fcrttemberg coat of arms was installed above the exit during the demolition of K\u00f6nigstor (king's gate) at the end of K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe in 1922. From the central exit there is an access to the Klett passage, but it is not possible to cross the Arnulf-Klett-Platz above ground. As part of the Stuttgart 21 project, the staircase to the above ground station hall is to be divided into three parts and its middle section is to be demolished to provide a passage for direct access to the distribution level behind.\n\n\n==== Large ticket hall ====\n\nThe large ticket hall acts as an avant-corps in the fa\u00e7ade of the entrance building, while also being an independent building. The arched opening to the city reinforces its monumentality and thus acts to give direction. It also reflects the motif of a city gate, which refers to the original location of the station in front of the city. The spatial effect arises not only from the size of the hall, but also from its functionality for rail travellers. The former K\u00f6nigstor, which had stood at the beginning of Unteren K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe since 1809 and actually fulfilled the function of a city gate, was perceived as a traffic obstacle after the construction of the station and was removed in 1922. Paul Bonatz rescued the shield of K\u00f6nigstor and had it mounted above the central entrance in the platform hall.\nThe large ticket hall was originally intended for long-distance traffic, which was handled on tracks 7 to 16. It receives the traffic coming from the K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, but it is not aligned with the axis of the K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe. The interior of the hall has a vestibule character and the path to the station hall leads up a flight of steps. The original staircase was removed in the 1970s and replaced by a new staircase and two escalators. Around that time, the ground was broken to provide access to the Klett passage.DB's travel centre and the AIRail check-in desks are now located in the large ticket hall and K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe is connected to the hall via the underground Klett passage.\nIn the course of the Stuttgart 21 project, the wall of the large ticket hall facing the station is to be breached in order to make a direct access to the planned distribution level behind it. The planned openings are to have the proportions of the arches above it. The staircase to the platform area would be removed, otherwise the width of the passage would not be sufficient for the expected flows of people and the spatial separation from the main hall would inevitably be obliterated by the installation of additional stairs. The main distribution system will be centered on the hub in the large ticket hall with the main pedestrian traffic flowing straight through.\n\n\n=== North wing ===\nThe approximately 20 metre-wide north wing consisted of a cubic area for the railway postal service, which was used by Deutsche Post until July 2010, and adjoining office space that were last used by the Intercity Hotel and the Federal Police. With a length of 83 metres, the north wing enclosed only part of the facilities on the platform, while the rest formed part of the freight yard, which was abandoned in 1995. The north wing was demolished in 2010 as part of the Stuttgart 21 project.Kurt-Georg-Kiesinger-Platz lies between the north wing and Heilbronner Stra\u00dfe. The new LBBW building lines on this square, while the remaining main building of the former Reichsbahndirektion Stuttgart (Reichsbahn railway division headquarters) building is on the other side of the street.\n\n\n=== Schlossgarten wing ===\n\nThe Schlossgarten wing, also known as the South wing, continued the axis of the K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe and forms the side of the station on the Schlossgarten. The wing itself was 200 metres long and together with the large ticket hall and the station tower formed a 277-metre-long facade to the Schlossgarten. The fa\u00e7ade was interrupted by the station tower and three 27-metre-wide avant-corps, which indicated the positions of the passenger subway and the former postal and express freight tunnels. The wing concealed the difference in height between the Mittlerer Schlossgarten (Central Palace Garden) and the railway facilities, while, during the steam era, it also protected the Schlossgarten from soot and noise from railway operations and functioned as a facade preserving the view from the park. The interior of the wing was used for rail services and express freight operations.The Schlossgarten wing was demolished in the course of the Stuttgart 21 project from January 2012. According to the architect Christoph Ingenhoven, it was \"technically absolutely impossible\" to save the wing because the new underground concourse would cut it.\n\n\n=== Klett passage ===\n\nSeven Stadtbahn lines pass through the lower S-Bahn station under the station forecourt (Arnulf-Klett-Platz) in the second basement. The Klett passage on level \u22121 is the access and distribution level for the long-distance and regional services on level +1, to the S-Bahn services on level \u22123, to the Stadtbahn services on level \u22122 and to  Arnulf-Klett-Platz on level 0 and the city centre. In it is also a large shopping arcade.\nAnother part of the first basement level is used for an underground car park with 120 parking spaces, which also serves as a fallout shelter with 4,500 seats. In a disaster or military emergency, part of the underground parking lot would be provided with beds (separated by pressure doors); the technical rooms, kitchen, sanitary installations, water and air conditioning for the bunker are located on the second basement level.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nThe front of the building features a quote by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in the form of a lit inscription\u2014the quote reads \u2026 da\u00df diese Furcht zu irren schon der Irrtum selbst ist.\u2014loosely translated as \"\u2026 that this fear of making a mistake is a mistake itself.\"  The inscription is a work by the artist Joseph Kosuth from the early 1990s.\nIn the main hall, near the south exit, there is a DB Lounge for first-class passengers, bahn.comfort (a customer loyalty program) customers and first class and \"Senator\" AIRail passengers.\nSchillerstra\u00dfe (Arnulf-Klett-Platz) in front of the station is used by up to 50,000 vehicles a day.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nIn 1994, Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was the source of 49,400 passengers in regional traffic (excluding the S-Bahn) and 39,000 in long-distance traffic (ICE, IC, IR) each day. With about 210,000 passengers per day, the station was the biggest in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 2005. More than 12,000 people transferred daily between Stadtbahn and regional services in 2014.\nAccording to DB data 164 long-distance trains, 426 regional trains (as of 2009) and 650 S-Bahn trains (as of 2005) serve the station daily.\n\n\n=== Long-distance connections ===\nThe most significant long-distance connections available at the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof are listed here:\n\n\n=== Regional connections ===\nIn most cases, these connection start or end in Stuttgart.  This means that for most connections that go through Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, a change of trains is necessary.  As part of the Stuttgart 21 project, with Stuttgart Hbf becoming a through-station, most regional connections would no longer require the change of trains.\nAmong the seven local regional lines starting in Stuttgart, the line to T\u00fcbingen, with an average of 32,100 passengers during the week, was the most used in 2014.\n\n\n=== S-Bahn connections ===\nThe abbreviation for the Hauptbahnhof S-Bahn station underground is TST.\nThe station is to be modernised between the end of 2019 and the end of 2020 at a cost of \u20ac9 million.\n\n\n=== Freight traffic ===\n\nIn addition to the passenger station, there used to be a closed and already demolished freight station and small shunting station, which featured a marshaling hump with rail brakes. The freight yard was used until the 1980s. The goods traffic was later completely shifted to the Kornwestheim marshalling yard; the decision to move was made independently of the Stuttgart 21 project.\n\n\n=== Stadtbahn ===\nUnder the Arnulf-Klett-Platz (the station forecourt), the largest and most important node of the Stadtbahn features these routes:\n\nIn addition, in case of events at the NeckarPark and Cannstatter Wasen\n\n\n== Noteworthy ==\nThe Hauptbahnhof has been assigned the IATA code ZWS, because the station is used by Lufthansa in the AIRail concept.  Passengers may travel in ICE trains, which are also assigned flight numbers, to Frankfurt Airport in Frankfurt am Main, instead of using a short-distance flight.  For this reason, Lufthansa has a check-in counter near the entrance from the Arnulf-Klett-Platz.  Passengers were able to both check and receive their baggage at this counter until 2007; since then, only check-in is possible.\n\n\n=== District of the city centre ===\nHauptbahnhof has also been the name of one of ten sub-districts of the district of Stuttgart-Mitte (central Stuttgart) since 2007. This district has only a few residential buildings, so its population was 287 in 2014. Previously it was called Klettplatz.\n\n\n== Stuttgart 21 ==\n\nAs part of the Stuttgart 21 project, the two wings were demolished. There has been widespread resentment of the entire project to place the main lines underground, leading to significant protests, in particular in response to the felling of some 260 huge and old trees. More than 18,000 people have registered as Parksch\u00fctzer (park guardians); about a thousand vowed to stay in the path of demolition crews while chaining themselves to the trees. The colourful resistance led to nearly daily demonstrations and became a major factor in the 2011 state elections.\nThe Stuttgart architect and Bonatz expert Matthias Roser initiated an international call for the preservation of the Hauptbahnhof, including the wings, and over 400 architects, building historians, monument conservators, art historians, and city planners, such as the Pritzker Architecture Prize recipients Richard Meier and David Chipperfield, joined this effort. This group viewed the Bonatz-designed building as one of the most significant railway station structures of the 20th century in Germany and Europe as a whole, and were opposed to any structural changes.\nOn 27 November 2011, a referendum on the project \"Stuttgart 21\" resulted in 58.8% voted in favor of the project, while 41.2% voted against it.In order to provide necessary space for the new station's construction\u2014next to the main building, where the ends of the platforms used to be\u2014the platforms had to be moved away from the building, and the track layout underwent significant changes. In the process, three trains derailed on different occasions in 2012.\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nStuttgart 21 is a transport and urban development project under construction for the complete reorganisation of the Stuttgart railway junction. The existing terminus is to be rotated by about 90\u00b0 and converted into a through station with eight tracks. For this purpose, the approach track are being laid in tunnels from all directions. The aim is to increase the capacity of the station, to shorten transfer routes and to reduce maintenance costs. During the debate surrounding the project, critics proposed several alternative plans, including the extensive refurbishment and the progressive redevelopment of the existing station under the concept of Kopfbahnhof 21 (terminus 21).\nIn the feasibility study submitted in 1995, the cost of the underground station (today's planning approval section 1.1, excluding the access tracks required by its new location) was estimated at DM 930 million (\u20ac476 million). In 2009, the costs were estimated at \u20ac400 million. According to the overall planner Ingenhoven, the calculated costs are less than ten percent above the original cost estimate (as of 2013). Deutsche Bahn AG estimates that the expenditure of approximately \u20ac110 million will be required for the continued \"third-party use\" of the Bonatz building, which is not part of the Stuttgart 21 project.\n\n\n=== Planned measures ===\nThe station is covered by the planning approval for section 1.1 of the Stuttgart 21 project. The application for planning approval of the first section of Stuttgart 21 was submitted on 31 October 2001. The five-day hearing of objections closed on 11 April 2003 after more than 50 hours of debate. It was considered the largest and most complicated hearing in the history of the Stuttgart regional council. Planning approval was granted by the Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) on 28 January 2005 and became final in June 2006. The Bund f\u00fcr Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland (BUND) lodged a class action against the approval. By mid-2015 there had been fourteen amendments to the plan, including fundamental changes such as the doubling of the groundwater extraction rate (seventh amendment of the plan), the installation of additional escape stairs (sixth amendment) and the shortening of the channel carrying the Nesenbach (stream) and the adoption of an open design for it (14th amendment).In July 2015, a further amendment to the plan was announced, which means that the smoke extraction building in S\u00e4ngerstra\u00dfe will remain unchanged externally, but will receive a significantly more efficient ventilation system.\n\n\n==== Pedestrian network ====\nThe four 420-metre-long island platforms will have a width of 10 metres and will be 1.60 metres wider than the platforms of the current terminus.The comfort of passenger movements resulting from the planned entrances, footbridges, stairs, lifts and platforms was examined in a pedestrian flow analysis. In the peak hour, the traffic quality is mainly in the range of quality level C (\"limited speed selection\") and partly in the range of quality level D (\"clearly limited speed choice\"), outside the peak hour, quality levels A and B (free or almost free flow of traffic) is achieved.\n\n\n==== Track layout ====\nThe station is to have eight platform tracks, which are to be connected at both ends of the station to four access tracks:\n\nin the northwest to two tracks each towards Feuerbach and Bad Cannstatt.\nin the southeast to two tracks each towards Flughafen/Messe/Ulm and Wangen/Obert\u00fcrkheim/Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nThe two ends of the station are planned to be grade separated with flying junctions. From each of the four directions of approach, trains will be able to reach five of the eight platform tracks. The two middle platform tracks will be able to be used by trains from all four directions. The planned entry speed on the approach tracks is 60 km/h (outer tracks), 80 km/h and 100 km/h (island platform 4 and 5). Blocked paths would also be avoided by a flexible choice of approaches from the existing lines. The number of sets of points (each outside the operations of the station) will decrease compared to the current terminus from 225 to 48.Already in the course of the \"preliminary project\" initiated in early 1995, the track plan of the planned underground station had been optimised for directional operation to such an extent that all platforms operating in each direction could be reached from all incoming tracks. The plan for the northern end of the station had been changed compared to the plan submitted to the regional planning procedure after an anhydrite deposit was found in the geotechnical investigation. The nearest entrance and exit turnouts were shifted by about 150 metres towards the station. The transition from two twin-track tunnels to four single-track tunnels was also preferred.\n\nThe planned station hall measures 447 metres in length and 80.58 metres in width, at a height of 10 to 12 metres. The building will be founded on a 1.60 to 2.50 metre thick plate and anchored by 3,700 piles. The base of the building will lie between 6 and 8 metres below the water table. Between the lowest point of the foundations and the groundwater, according to the promoter, there would be a water-impermeable layer more than 35 metres thick. The new station can only be built as cut and cover to avoid disturbances to the level of the groundwater.The planning approval section begins in the northwest at line-km -0.442. At this point, in the area of J\u00e4gerstra\u00dfe 24, the connecting tunnels, which have been constructed using a mining method, open out into the station. The gradient initially drops from an altitude of 241 metres (at the railhead; ground altitude: 258 metres) to the south for 404 metres at 1.31 percent and then continues for another 459 metres at a gradient of 1.51 percent, before an inflection point (km +0.345, 230 metres above sea level at the railhead, 12 metres below ground level) at the southern end of the station from which the gradient rises to the end of the section at 0.41 percent. The section limit is at line-kilometre +0.432, in the Willy-Brandt-Platz area, at the junction with the connecting tunnels to be excavated by mining methods.According to the Deutsche Bahn information, a track gradient of up to 1.51 percent is required in the platform area due to several fixed points (Stadtbahn lines and groundwater streams), which is above the ruling limit for station tracks of 0.25 percent. Safe operations are still guaranteed by a bank in the middle of the platforms of 1.0 percent. In March 2016, it was announced that the proof of sufficient security required for operations had not yet been provided. This also makes it unclear what operational restrictions will be required for the increased gradient. Critics see significant risks from trains moving accidentally on this gradient.\n\n\n==== Station building ====\n\n21 different changes will be made on the remaining part of the former station building, the so-called Bonatz-Bau (Bonatz building), in parallel with the Stuttgart 21 project. The function of the building will be maintained. The building's fa\u00e7ades will be preserved using a new structural frame and modern building technology. Construction on the Bonatz building is scheduled to begin in 2018 and be completed 2021.A hotel, restaurant and conference complex with 150 hotel rooms will be built in the above-ground part of the building on four levels. Levels +3 and +4 will be rebuilt, but set back from Schillerstra\u00dfe so that they do not affect the overall impression of the building from that street.Stra\u00dfburger Platz (\"Strasbourg Square\") is to be created on the roof of the through station at the current level of the railway tracks and the current platform hall (the so-called \"level +1\"). This area, delimited to the south by the Bonatz building and to the north by a new station building, will connect Kurt-Georg-Kiesinger-Platz with the Schlossgarten. Daylight will reach the platforms through 27 4.30 metre-high \"high-light eyes\" (Lichtaugen).A distribution level with access from the station tower, K\u00f6nigsstra\u00dfe, K\u00f6nigsallee (Cannstatter Stra\u00dfe) and the new city district is to be created below Stra\u00dfburger Platz on level 0. The four platforms are to be arranged with eight platform tracks on the lower level (\"level \u22121\"). Access to the lower-lying, double-track S-Bahn station is planned below the new platform tracks. A new parking garage is to be built below the northern part of the station building and to the north of it, but underground. Level \u22122 is to act as the S-Bahn level, including giving access to it.The entrance to the station building is to be built next to the existing entrances and will run through four 23 metres-wide and up to 10 metres-high glass-mesh shells. In total, more than 35 escalators and 15 so-called \"panoramic\" lifts are planned.The platforms are to be accessed via three distribution points (level 0) near two ticket halls and the Planetarium/Staatsgalerie. Each platform is to be accessed by three lifts, five escalators and five sets of stairs. A new shortcut to the Staatsgalerie Stadtbahn stop is to be built at the eastern end.\n\nThe main access to the platform level is to be provided by the middle pier (pier B), which is to be accessed via the large ticket hall and the new access to the station tower in the south and the Europaviertel (\"European quarter\", a new commercial development) in the north. Each of the four platforms is accessed from this ramp via a lift and two escalators and sets of stairs on each side. Critics have noted that the passage is just 2.04 metres wide between the outer edge of the stairs and the platform edge at the point.\nThe western pier (pier A) is to be reached mainly via the new access at Kurt-Georg-Kiesinger-Platz and the small ticket hall. From this pier, each platform is accessed via a lift and an escalator and a set of stairs on each side. The passage is 2.85 metres wide at its narrowest point.The eastern pier (pier C) is appraached via the entrance from the Staatsgalerie, which can be reached by a pedestrian tunnel. An elevator as well as two escalators and two sets of stairs are planned at the exit to the Staatsgalerie. It has no access to piers A and B and thus no access to the Bonatz building. From the distribution level, each platform is connected by a lift and an escalator and a set of stairs to the west. The passage width between the stairs and the platform edge is 2.86 metres.After the commissioning of Stuttgart 21, an additional station building will be built on the opposite side of the new through station, which will serve as a station access from the north and will also accommodate operating rooms. Alteration of the Stadtbahn line under Heilbronner Stra\u00dfe was due from mid-2011 to mid-2014 and of the Staatsgalerie Stadtbahn station from February 2013. Among the numerous other construction measures is the relocation of the Nesenbach (construction was originally planned for late 2011 to mid-2014, but started in June 2015) and the West main drains.\n\n\n===== Light and air conditioning =====\nThe rail infrastructure is designed as a zero-energy building: the air conditioning will be operated exclusively using geothermal energy, assisted by the cooling effect of incoming trains. The temperature in the platform area should also not fall below ten degrees without artificial heating (at an external temperature of \u221220 degrees Celsius) or exceed 29 degrees. The \"high-light eyes\" will also be able to be opened for ventilation and smoke extraction. Experiments have shown that the station concourse will be lit naturally by the high-light eyes for up to 14 hours daily and will be able to cope during this period without artificial light. Floor lights at the edge of the platform will mark the edge of the platform next to the track bed. On average, 5 percent of daylight would enter the interior, but under the high-light eyes, this proportion would rise to 10 to 15 percent.\n\n\n=== History ===\n\n\n==== Planning ====\nOn the basis of \"operational considerations\", the station considered for the feasibility study at the beginning of 1995 provided for eight platforms with four 10-metre-wide and 420-metre-long island platforms. The tracks, which would be dedicated to operations in a particular direction, would have had connecting passages in the tunnels running from the platforms. To the northwest, two twin-track connecting tunnels were to run in parallel and after a sharp curve to the northeast would divide south of Mittnachtstrasse station (in the Wolframstra\u00dfe area) into a branch towards Feuerbach and a branch towards Bad Cannstatt. To the southeast, four single-track tunnels were to be built directly to the turnout halls (two to Obert\u00fcrkheim and Untert\u00fcrkheim and two to the Airport). Under the design presented as an example, the Bonatz Building would have been preserved and an additional entrance would have been created in the side wing on Cannstatter Stra\u00dfe. The railway layout would be built at a gradient of up to 1.1 percent. According to the feasibility study, the costs of the section including the station and the valley crossing, would amount to DM 928 million (DM 807 million plus 15 percent for planning costs, 1993 prices), which on an inflation-adjusted basis would have amounted to \u20ac635 million.\nThe Synergiekonzept Stuttgart 21 (\"synergy concept\") presented at the end of 1995 provided for an eight-track through station with three island and two outer platforms. Traffic forecasts expected an increase to 70,400 long-distance and 53,100 regional passengers each day. The share of through traffic in total traffic in 2010 was projected to be around 50 percent for long-distance and just under 20 percent for regional services (54,000 and 13,000 passengers each day). The plan was later modified so that four island platforms are now planned on the concourse.\nA regional planning process (Raumordnungsverfahren) was carried out for the Stuttgart 21 project in 1996 and 1997. The through station solution favoured by Deutsche Bahn was examined as a proposed route with different suboptions. These included options with different platform positions, numbers of track and possibilities for further development.Other options, which deviated from the basic concept of a pure through station at the location of the existing terminus station, were mentioned in the spatial planning process, but were not examined to the same depth: the \"lean\" option provided for a continuation of the terminal station, while the \"Kombi\" option provided for the construction of a through station for long-distance traffic, but the terminal station would also be maintained. In addition, a Hauptbahnhof am Rosenstein (main station on Rosenstein ridge) option was considered, which would have involved abandonment of the current station. In addition, station locations in Bad Cannstatt and Untert\u00fcrkheim were considered.On 28 February 1997, a Europe-wide architectural competition for the redesign of the station was announced. The new station should be a \"visible sign of pioneering mobility and a landmark for Stuttgart and its region\".In a two-stage process, 19 participants out of 118 applicants who had initially submitted a concept were selected for a second round. A jury chaired by Klaus Humpert selected four equal winners in July 1997. The four award-winning designs and six other designs were displayed in Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof from 11 August to 14 September 1997. All four designs provided a station rotated by 90 degrees with daylight illumination. On 4 November 1997, the design of the office of Ingenhoven, Overdiek, Kahlen and Partner was finally chosen from the 126 submissions.Ingenhoven's concept at that time was to build the station underground at a cost of DM 350 million (equivalent to about \u20ac216 million) and to illuminate it with daylight from 27 light shafts, each 15 metres wide. The support structure of the station concourse was developed by Frei Otto. The draft had been revised several times already in the competition. Four designs were available in the final round.In 2005, the design received the MIPIM Future Project Award from the magazine Architectural Review as well as a Silver Award at the regional Holcim Awards and a Golden Award in the global competition the following year. In 2007, the design was awarded one of 58 International Architecture Awards from the Chicago Athenaeum.By 2006, the \u20ac2.8 billion estimated total cost of Stuttgart 21 included almost \u20ac800 million for the Hauptbahnhof. The architect, Christoph Ingenhoven, received \u20ac36 million.A modified building design was presented at the end of August 2010. Among other things, the size of the four entrances was reduced and routing and acoustics were revised.\nHeiner Gei\u00dfler, who was entrusted with the task of conciliating views in relation to the Stuttgart 21 project, suggested in his conciliatory appeal on 30 November 2010 that the safety of rail traffic, accessibility and fire safety of the through station should be improved. In addition to improvements to the track, a ninth and tenth platform track at the main station should also be investigated.On 23 April 2015, the Federal Railway Authority approved, among other things, the construction of two escape staircases per platform and changes to the shells surrounding the four direct entrances from the outside. The planning amendment notice for the displacement of the evacuation staircases planned on the platforms to the ends of the station hall was delayed and is now expected in the summer of 2017.Ingenhoven reported that the cost of the station at the end of 2017 was \"well below\" \u20ac1 billion.\n\n\n==== Construction ====\n\nWith the symbolic start of construction on 2 February 2010 reconstruction work began on the track apron; these were necessary for the construction of the cross-platform concourse at the end of the platforms.The contract to demolish the north wing was awarded to Wolff & M\u00fcller on 18 May 2010. The establishment of the worksite began on 30 July 2010 under police protection and the demolition of the facade of the north wing began on 25 August 2010.\n\nWork on the demolition of the south wing began on 13 January 2012 with the gutting of the building. The exterior demolition of the building began on 30 January and was due to be completed in March 2012. After a pillar of the platform canopy was damaged on 19 March, work was suspended for about three weeks. After further damage due to gale-force gusts on 1 July 2012, platform 15/16 was blocked off again and work started on the upgrade of the glass panes on all platform canopies.The approximately 110-meter-wide excavation was due to be bridged by two ten-metre-wide bridges by April 2014. In addition direct access was to be provided to the cross-platform concourse from both sides. Access to the Europaviertel district on the north side has been possible since 21 October 2013 and on the south side there has been access via the pedestrian walkways from the Mittlerer Schlossgarten since 24 January 2014. Both entrances are barrier-free.The repositioning of the cross-platform concourse was postponed several times. According to the planning status of March 2012, the cross-platform concourse was to be gradually advanced between July and December 2012. At the end of June 2012, just over 50 of the 61 planned construction phases had been completed on the track apron. Platform tracks 1 and 2 were re-connected without completing the planned construction of the new S-Bahn tunnel in this area. Construction of the new cross-platform concourse took place from late May 2013 to 22 October 2013 in 13 phases, requiring two platform tracks were blocked off. Deutsche Bahn reduced some train services during this period to reduce congestion of trains at the station. The preliminary work and the commissioning of the cross platform, 120 metres north of its original location, should have taken 18 months to complete, but actually lasted 45 months.A two-storey underground engineering building of 1,800 square metres was built under the former parking lot at the northern exit at a planned cost of \u20ac7.6 million between April 2012 and October 2013 (when the construction of the shell was completed)On 12 March 2012, the construction contract for the underground station, including the West, Cannstatter Stra\u00dfe and Nesenbach channels and the station access tunnel, was awarded to a consortium of the Z\u00fcblin (manager) and Strabag companies. The formal award took place on 24 March 2012. The contract for the construction of the new central station was let for \u20ac323.4 million, which was a sliding price under the contract. The internal portion being built by Z\u00fcblin amounts to around \u20ac300 million. Groundwater management is not part of the scope of the contract. The total contract value was \u20ac347.4 million in May 2016 and \u20ac364 million in August 2016.At the end of 2010, the lowest tender for the construction of the underground station amounted to about \u20ac360 million. The first contract planned to be let in late 2011 was delayed over price negotiations. Also technical questions led to delays. In addition to successful negotiations, technical optimisations, such as a change in the type of concrete, would have contributed to savings, according to a media report. Deutsche Bahn had calculated a price of \u20ac300 million based on its own data.\n\nIn July, September and October 2012 trains derailed on the exit towards Feuerbach, which had been rebuilt in the course of the Stuttgart 21 project. Following the latest derailment, platform tracks 8, 9 and 10 were blockaded. In January 2013, Deutsche Bahn justified the derailments as being the result of \"malfunctioning carriage buffers\". A short-term technical solution developed by DB was rejected by the Federal Railway Authority. The suspension also led to far-reaching delays of S-Bahn and regional services. On 22 January 2013, track 10 was conditionally released for service. Only multiple units and hauled trains could use it. According to Federal Railway Authority data, the unrestricted clearance of the track was not possible on the basis of documents that had been submitted. According to Deutsche Bahn in December 2014, an end to these restrictions was not foreseeable.In March 2012, the beginning of civil engineering work was scheduled for early 2013. The civil works on the excavation of the station began on 5 August 2014 at pit 16 in the Mittleren Schlossgarten. A mid-2013 timetable for the excavation work in the Mittleren Schlossgarten was considered obsolete by mid-2014. Out of 14 construction stages planned so far, 7 had been realised and the work had been delayed by about five months.An already issued statistical proof of the safety of the station has not applied since 2014 due to changed legal requirements and a renewal is pending. Civil engineering work at the station was stopped at the beginning of March 2015 because a permit from the Federal Railway Authority for the construction of additional escape staircases was missing. The work was thus eight months late compared with early projections.On 26 January 2016, one year later than scheduled under the August 2014 timetable, work began on casting the floor slab in the first excavation pit of the station, initially as the base plate in what is known as the Medienkanal (middle channel).\n\nThe concreting of the first roof stanchions was due to start in June 2017. The 28 columns are to be concreted two at a time.\n\nIn mid-2017, the building of the former Deutsche Bahndirektion (Deutsche Bahn divisional headquarters) was undermined and placed on a 1.3 m thick concrete slab. This rests in turn on some supports, between which the construction machinery and vehicles can operate. DB had sought the demolition and reconstruction of the building built in 1911\u20131912. The city of Stuttgart, however, insisted on its preservation.\n\n\n=== Groundwater management ===\nThe groundwater has been lowered by approximately seven metres by pumping for the construction of the excavations. The resulting funnel of lowered groundwater usually extends for several hundred metres. In order to reduce the disturbance, water is reintroduced (infiltration via injection well) in the vicinity of the construction excavations. The groundwater must be treated prior to being reintroduced to reduce possible pollution.The management of groundwater was originally expected to involve around three million cubic metres of groundwater. Following a change in the plan at the beginning of 2011, this figure doubled to 6.8 million cubic metres, necessitating an amendment to the license in relation to its scope and impact.The groundwater management was expected to start in January 2013. On 25 June 2012, it was announced that a public hearing was required to consider Deutsche Bahn's proposal to double the groundwater withdrawal to 6.8 million cubic metres, delaying the construction work (according to media reports, to 2014). According to its own statements, Deutsche Bahn's planned to open excavation pits requiring less groundwater withdrawals in the spring of 2013 and thus comply with the planning approval decision (which stipulates lower withdrawal quantities). According to a media report, however, the Federal Railway Authority and the Stuttgart Regional Council assumed that the construction work would not begin before 2014. The Federal Railway Authority approved the increased groundwater abstraction on 22 September 2014.\n\n\n=== Future ===\n\nIt is planned to successively carry out the construction of the valley crossing and the station in 25 subsections. The shell of the station was expected to be completed by the end of 2017 (as of January 2011). The Staatsgalerie Stadtbahn station is being relocated to the south side of the future station. Preparatory measures started at the end of 2014, when completion was scheduled for 2019/2020 at the latest.The excavated material is transported via separate construction roads and a conveyor belt to a central logistics area at Stuttgart Nord station and transported from there on freight trains. The commissioning of the new station is scheduled for December 2021.\nA traffic forecast for 2025 anticipates around 207,600 long-distance and regional passengers, including 118,800 from the direction of Feuerbach and Bad Cannstatt and 88,800 from the Filder Tunnel, Obert\u00fcrkheim or Untert\u00fcrkheim. The accessibility of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof traffic cell by public transport from the Stuttgart region, based on weighted average traffic demand, should improve, according to a traffic forecast from 32 minutes (2010) to 31 minutes (2025).Stuttgarter Netz AG, a consortium of several private railway companies, intends to operate part of the existing terminal station. The company expects up to 100 trains to stop at the station every working day. Eight tracks of the terminal station, the access tracks from Bad Cannstatt, Feuerbach and Vaihingen and the existing signal box would be preserved for this purpose. Overall, a quarter of the existing area would be preserved. The calculated annual costs of \u20ac1.6 million are expected to be offset by revenue from train and station operations of \u20ac1.8 million. Among other things, secondary lines such as the Sch\u00f6nbuch and the Wieslauf Valley Railways would be connected with Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof.\n\n\n=== Rail operations ===\nAccording to a simulation commissioned by the promoters, the optimum performance range of the through station lies between 42 and 51 trains per hour, while for an upgraded terminal station (the Kopfbahnhof 21 concept) it would be 28 to 38 trains per hour. The maximum flow will be 72 trains in the through station or 43 trains per hour in the terminal station. In 2002, Deutsche Bahn estimated a capacity increase of 50 percent for the 8-track through station compared to the 16-track terminal station; with an upgrade of the approach tracks from Feuerbach, 125 percent more trains would be able to run during the peak.Critics doubt these claims. Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (a state agency that helps coordinate public transport operations) confirmed its opinion that the existing terminal station could already carry 50 trains and, with improved signalling technology, it would carry 56 trains an hour.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nDostal, Michael; Estler, Thomas (2012).

        "wiki": "Ludwigsburg Palace, nicknamed the \"Versailles of Swabia\", is a 452-room palace complex of 18 buildings located in Ludwigsburg, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. Its total area, including the gardens, is 32 ha (79 acres) \u2013 the largest palatial estate in the country. The palace has four wings: the northern wing, the Alter Hauptbau, is the oldest and was used as a ducal residence; the east and west wings were used for court purposes and housing guests and courtiers; the southern wing, the Neuer Hauptbau, was built to house more court functions and was later used as a residence.\nEberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, appointed Philipp Joseph Jenisch to direct the work and construction began in 1704. In 1707, Jenisch was replaced with Johann Friedrich Nette, who completed the majority of the palace and surrounding gardens. Nette died in 1714, and Donato Giuseppe Frisoni finished much of the palace facades. In the final year of construction, Eberhard Louis died and the Neue Hauptbau's interiors were left incomplete. Charles Eugene's court architect, Philippe de La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re, completed and refurbished parts of the New Hauptbau in the Rococo style, especially the palace theatre. Charles Eugene abandoned the palace for Stuttgart in 1775. Duke Frederick II, later King Frederick I, began using Ludwigsburg as his summer residence in the last years of Charles Eugene's reign. Frederick and his wife Charlotte, Princess Royal, resided at Ludwigsburg and employed Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret to renovate the palace in the Neoclassical style. Thouret converted much of Ludwigsburg's interiors over the reign of Frederick and later life of Charlotte. As a result of each architect's work, Ludwigsburg is a combination of Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical, and Empire style architecture.\nThe constitutions of the Kingdom and Free People's State of W\u00fcrttemberg were ratified at Ludwigsburg Palace, in 1819 and 1919 respectively. It was the residence for four of W\u00fcrttemberg's monarchs and some other members of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg and their families. The palace was opened to the public in 1918 and survived World War II intact. It underwent periods of restoration in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1990s and again for the palace's 300th anniversary in 2004. The palace had more than 350,000 visitors in 2017 and has hosted the Ludwigsburg Festival every year since 1947.\nSurrounding the palace are the Blooming Baroque (Bl\u00fchendes Barock) gardens, arranged in 1954 as they might have appeared in 1800. Nearby is Schloss Favorite, a hunting lodge built in 1717 by Frisoni. Within the palace are two museums operated by the Landesmuseum W\u00fcrttemberg dedicated to fashion and porcelain respectively.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\"Ludwigsburg,\" meaning \"Louis's castle,\" was named after its builder, Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1705. It had been previously known as the Erlachhof, a traditional hunting estate and lodge of the Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg that was destroyed in 1692, during the Nine Years' War. Eberhard Louis commissioned a replacement lodge that was built from 1697 to 1701. Construction was interrupted by the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, fought against France and Bavaria. W\u00fcrttemberg resisted entry into the war until late 1702. Two years later, Eberhard Louis participated in the Allied victory at the Battle of Blenheim that was followed by the exile of the Bavarian Elector. The duke used the battle to press claims to Bavarian lands, but he illegally occupied those lands and was further weakened by a French invasion of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1707. As a result of this attack, the ducal residence in the capital, Stuttgart, was burned and the royal family fled to Switzerland. With the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the occupied Bavarian territory and status of the exiled Elector were restored.Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace began in May 1704 with the laying of the Alter Hauptbau's cornerstone by Eberhard Louis. The year before, he sent Philipp Joseph Jenisch to study architecture abroad. Eberhard Louis made Jenisch director of construction upon his return the next year, but he only managed to finish the Alter Hauptbau's (Old main building) first floor and some of the southern garden before 1707. The duke spent the winter of 1705\u201306 at Nymphenburg Palace, residence of the Elector of Bavaria, and was impressed by what he saw there and in architectural publications. Unable to compete with Bavaria militarily or politically, Eberhard Louis decided to build a new palace and town inspired by Versailles, which would be the center of his domestic society and diplomacy. Located 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) from Stuttgart, Eberhard Louis could set up a court with his mistress, Wilhelmine von Gr\u00e4venitz, and demonstrate his absolutist status as a monarch. Eberhard Louis lost faith in Jenisch's ability and in 1707 replaced him with Johann Friedrich Nette, an engineer. By 1709, it had become apparent that the massive undertaking of the palace's construction eventually necessitated the building of a town, also known as Ludwigsburg. That cost of construction provoked financial consequences, opposition at court, and criticism from the populace. A major retrenchment of court functions took place in 1709 that shrank the orchestra to eight members. That same year, after a fatal workplace accident at the palace, a pastor in nearby O\u00dfweil said of the palace at his pulpit, \"May God spare our land the chastising that the Ludwigsburg brood of sinners conjure.\"\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nNette was now charged with building a complete Baroque palace from Jenisch's central corps de logis, to which an east wing and a west wing were to be added, aligned at 11\u00b0. Nette based his plans on those of Jenisch, enabling him to complete his design for a three-wing palace in the same year as his appointment. The galleries of the Alter Hauptbau were completed in 1707, then the corps de logis the next year. The Ordensbau and Riesenbau were constructed from 1709 to 1713, and their interiors were completed in 1714. Nette began the interior of the Alter Hauptbau, which he would never finish. Construction of the building's pavilions dragged on into 1722. Nette made two trips to Prague and his native Brandenburg to expand his pool of talent. He hired Johann Jakob Stevens von Steinfels, Tomasso Soldati, and Donato Giuseppe Frisoni in 1708, Andreas Quitainner in 1709, and then Luca Antonio Colomba, Riccardo Retti and Diego Francesco Carlone. Nette fled to Paris from an accusation of embezzlement from Jenisch's allies but was ordered back to Ludwigsburg by Eberhard Louis. On his return trip, he died suddenly of a stroke on 9 December 1714 in Nancy at the age of 41. At the time of his death, most of the northern section of the modern palace and its northern garden was complete.Eberhard Louis stunted an attempt by Jenisch to reprise his previous role as director, replacing Nette in 1715 with Frisoni. Frisoni, although having no formal training in architecture, enjoyed the support of the court chamberlain and impressed the duke with his stucco work in the Alter Hauptbau. Frisoni resumed construction with the palace's churches, beginning the Schlosskapelle in 1716 and the Ordenskapelle in 1720, then finished the Kavalierbauten (Cavaliers' Buildings) in 1722. Frisoni also added the mansard roof to the top of the Alter Hauptbau, as its flat roof was prone to water damage. This had become a common issue with Nette's work because of the pressure the duke placed on him to finish the palace as soon as possible. Frisoni's work thus far led him to believe that he did not have a large enough talent pool to satisfy the duke's desires for the palace and town, so Frisoni brought in Giacomo Antonio Corbellini and Paolo Retti, his brother and son-in-law respectively, who were followed by Diego Carlone in 1718.In 1721, the duke began to run out of room in the Alter Hauptbau for the functions of his court and Frisoni began planning to enlarge it. The duke dismissed the idea in 1724 and ordered Frisoni to construct the Neuer Hauptbau. Frisoni designed a four-story structure, double the height of the existing palace, but plans changed several times after construction began in 1725 atop the first terrace of the south garden. Frisoni settled on a three-story building that still afforded Eberhard Louis six rooms for his suite to the three in the Alter Hauptbau. To connect the Neuer Hauptbau to the existing palace, Frisoni built the Bildergalerie and Festinbau on the west side, and the Ahnengalerie and Schlosstheater (Palace theater) on the east. The Bildergalerie and Ahnengalerie were decorated from 1731 to 1733. With the exception of the interiors of the Neuer Hauptbau and Schlosstheater, all work was finished in 1733, but Eberhard Louis died that same year. Only a few rooms in the west end of the Neuer Hauptbau had been completed when he died. Construction of the Neuer Hauptbau and its connecting galleries cost 465,000 guilders and was managed by Paolo Retti, who at times had more than 650 stone masons, cutters, and basic laborers working on the facades between 1726 and 1728. Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace cost the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg 3,000,000 florins.\n\n\n=== Residence ===\n\nEberhard Louis left no heirs and was succeeded by Charles Alexander. Charles Alexander ended funding for the palace, dismissed its staff, and moved the capital back to Stuttgart in 1733 to modernize W\u00fcrttemberg's army and fortifications. As central figures in the construction of what was now decried as the \"sin palace\", Frisoni and Paolo Retti were arrested in 1733 on fraudulent charges of embezzlement. The two men were acquitted in 1735 after they paid a hefty fine to the ducal treasury, despite attempted intervention by the Margrave of Ansbach to free them earlier. Frisoni died in Ludwigsburg on 29 November 1735. Charles Alexander himself died suddenly two years later on 12 March 1737 as he prepared to leave Ludwigsburg Palace to inspect the duchy's fortresses. After his death, the nine-year-old Charles Eugene became Duke, beginning a regency that lasted until 1744.Charles Eugene began the construction of a new palace in Stuttgart in 1746 but unofficially used Ludwigsburg as his residence until 1775. The function of certain rooms at Ludwigsburg changed frequently; Johann Christoph David von Leger converted the Ordenskapelle to a Lutheran church from 1746 to 1748 for Duchess Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie. Beginning in 1757 and lasting into the next year, the suites of the beletage were extensively modified by Philippe de La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re. La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re completed the Schlosstheater in 1758\u201359, adding a stage, machinery, and the auditorium. A wooden opera house, adorned with mirrors, was constructed in 1764\u201365, located east of the Alter Hauptbau. Although Charles Eugene officially declared Ludwigsburg Palace his residence in 1764, he made no further modifications after 1770. The palace that had hosted a court that Giacomo Casanova called \"the most magnificent in Europe\" began a steady decline. Charles Eugene died without a legitimate heir in 1793 and was succeeded by his brother, Frederick II Eugene, who was succeeded by his son Frederick II in 1797. Ludwigsburg Palace had already been Frederick II's summer residence since 1795, and he continued to use it as such with Duchess Charlotte after marrying her on 18 May 1797.\n\nNapoleon's armies occupied W\u00fcrttemberg from 1800\u201301, forcing the duke and duchess to flee to Vienna. The royals returned when Frederick II agreed in 1803 to pledge allegiance to Napoleon and part with W\u00fcrttemberg's territory on the Left Bank, an area of 388 square kilometers (150 sq mi). In exchange, according to the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville, Frederick II was named an Elector-prince and given 1,609 square kilometers (621 sq mi) of Right Bank territory. Frederick II, now Elector Frederick I, tasked his court architect Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret with renovating the palace in the Neoclassical style. Thouret started in the Ahengalerie and the Ordensbau, working there from 1803 to 1806. For two days in October 1805, Napoleon visited Ludwigsburg to coerce Frederick I into joining the Confederation of the Rhine and thus becoming his ally, compensating W\u00fcrttemberg with neighboring territories in the Holy Roman Empire and Frederick I with the title of King. Frederick I again tasked Thouret with a remodeling, from 1808 to 1811, of the Ordenskapelle and the king's apartment. The final modernizations ordered by the king took place from 1812 to 1816 in the Schlosstheater and Marble Hall. During this time, the ceiling frescoes of the Guard Room and the main staircases of the Neuer Hauptbau were repainted. By the time Frederick I died in 1816, the majority of the palace had been converted to reflect the latest style.Following her husband's death, Charlotte continued to reside at Ludwigsburg, receiving visitors such as her siblings. She tasked Thouret with the renovation of her own apartment, which was carried out between 1816 and 1824. The dowager queen died at the palace on 5 October 1828 following a bout of apoplexy. Charlotte was the last ruler of W\u00fcrttemberg to reside at Ludwigsburg, as Frederick's son and successor, William I, and future kings did not show any interest in the palace. Members of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg continued to reside at the palace into the early 20th century, while the W\u00fcrttembergs moved to Bebenhausen Abbey after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918.\n\n\n=== Later history ===\nIn 1817, ownership of Ludwigsburg Palace passed from the House of W\u00fcrttemberg to the government of the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg, which established offices there the next year. King William I chose the Order Hall, the throne room of his father, for the ratification of the kingdom's constitution in 1819. The palace's first restoration took place at the Alter Hauptbau in 1865.\n\nOn 9 November 1918, the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was dissolved with the abdication of King Wilhelm II. Ludwigsburg Palace was opened to the public that same year and a new constitution was ratified for the Free People's State of W\u00fcrttemberg on 12 January 1919. At this time, two apartments at Ludwigsburg Palace were still occupied by members of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, Duke Ulrich and Princess Olga. The new state ordered them vacated until 1 April for the ratification. Ulrich moved out of Ludwigsburg in January, but Olga rented a new suite in the Neuer Hauptbau in February. She continued to reside at Ludwigsburg in her apartment with her family until her death in 1932.The Schlosstheater hosted the W\u00fcrttemberg State Theatre for a production of Handel's Rodelinda in 1923, the first musical performance at the palace since 1853. In the early 1930s, Wilhelm Kr\u00e4mer began hosting the Ludwigsburger Schlo\u00dfkonzerte (Ludwigsburg Palace Concerts), which comprised six to ten concerts annually from 1933 to 1939. The palace survived World War II unscathed, though its furnishings were removed in 1944\u201345 and held at the monasteries at Alpirsbach and Lorch. It was chosen as the site of the Borkum Island war crimes trial in 1946. The concerts resumed in 1947 with 34 performances, a record that would not be broken until 1979. In 1952, the concerts were packed into a single week as the Ludwigsburger Schlo\u00dftage (\"Palace Days\"). They gained national significance when President Theodor Heuss attended a production of Mozart's Titus two years later. The concerts were named Ludwigsburger Schlo\u00dffestspiele in 1966, and were internationally known as the Ludwigsburg Festival. In 1980, the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg made the festival an official state event. On 9 September 1962, Charles de Gaulle delivered his \"speech to the German youth\" in the courtyard of Ludwigsburg Palace to 20,000 people.\n\nRestorations were undertaken in the 1950s and 1960s and again in the 1990s, in time for the palace's tricentenary in 2004. The anniversary was commemorated by the state government with three new museums. On 19 October 2011, Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann hosted a reception for the U.S. Army's 21st Theater Sustainment Command at the palace, which was attended by John D. Gardner, former deputy commander of EUCOM, and Gert Wessels, commander of all German troops in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Ludwigsburg appeared again on Federal postage stamps in the Burgen und Schl\u00f6sser series. The 50th anniversary of Charles de Gaulle's speech at Ludwigsburg was celebrated on 22 September 2012 and included appearances by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Minister-President Kretschmann, and French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Merkel and Hollande both spoke at the event, the former directly referencing de Gaulle's speech in French. A painting of Frederick the Great on display was found to be a rare original by Antoine Pesne in November 2017. Michael H\u00f6rrmann \u2013 the director of the Staatliche Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg \u2013 valued the portrait at a minimum of \u20ac1 million. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's Minister of Finance, Edith Sitzmann visited Ludwigsburg to see the painting and attend a press conference, where she spoke about the cultural importance of Ludwigsburg Palace.In 2017, 350,642 people visited Ludwigsburg Palace. By March 2020, Staatliche Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg plans to have spent \u20ac4 million to furnish the Neuer Hauptbau as it would have been during the reign of King Frederick I. To this end, about 500 paintings, 400 pieces of furniture, and 500 lamps, clocks, and sculptures \u2013 will be sourced, sorted, and restored.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nLudwigsburg Palace's Baroque architecture was built under Eberhard Louis from 1704 to 1733 and is characterized by a great deal of Austrian and Czech Baroque influence. This is most evident in the two churches, which resemble the Hospital Church of Kuks and the Sanctuary Church of Steyr. The palace's two Baroque architects, Johann Friedrich Nette and Donato Frisoni, were educated and worked in Bohemia and hired staff experienced in the Bohemian style. Frisoni even knew or was related to some of the artisans who worked at the Steyr church. French influence is also present, for example in the mirror halls in both the corps de logis and the palace's many mansard roofs. The combination of work by Germans (Philipp Jenisch and Nette) and Italians (Frisoni, Diego and Carlo Carlone, Giuseppe Baroffio, Scotti and Luca Antonio Colomba) produced a strong resemblance to late 17th century works in Prague and Vienna. Charles Eugene brought the Rococo style to Ludwigsburg in 1747 and his court architect, Philippe de La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re, worked in that style until 1775.Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, working with Antonio Isopi, renovated much of Ludwigsburg Palace for Frederick I and Charlotte Mathilde from 1797 to 1824. Thouret's work was heavily influenced by the French Imperial and Renaissance styles, the work of Charles Percier and Pierre Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9onard Fontaine, and Egyptian motifs that became popular in Europe with Napoleon's three-year Egyptian campaign. Isopi would simplify Thouret's plans, which were then carried out by the Biedermeier woodworker Johannes Klinckerfu\u00df and court painter Jean Pernaux. As a result, the palace's Neoclassical architecture does not reflect a single style or correspond to any one designer.\n\n\n=== North wing (Alter Hauptbau) ===\nThe north wing, referred to as the Alter Hauptbau (Old Main building), is the oldest portion of the palace. It was originally built to house the apartments of Eberhard Louis and Princess Henrietta Maria. Its facade was built from 1705 to 1708 and its interiors were mostly completed by 1715, although work inside its pavilions lasted into 1722. In 1809, and from 1826 to 1828, the rooms facing the courtyard in the beletage (main floor) were remodeled in the Neoclassical style, but their Baroque frescoes were revealed in 1865. The corps de logis opens with a wide vestibule, decorated by Frisoni in 1712, that terminates in an unadorned staircase. At the top of the stairs is a guard room and the four suites on the beletage. These follow the French Baroque model of a living room, audience chamber, and bedroom. Eberhard Louis's apartment features a hall of mirrors decorated with stucco by Frisoni and a hidden staircase, since removed, into the room of his mistress Wilhelmine von Gr\u00e4venitz. The third floor, finished in 1708, houses two galleries. The first takes up most of the south wall and served as a portrait gallery and ahnentafel (table of ancestors), with stucco portraits of Eberhard Louis and his ancestors created by Frisoni and Soldati in 1713. The ceiling fresco were lost in the 1808 renovation that divided into smaller rooms. The gallery was restored between 2000 and 2004. Above the third floor is a mansard roof that now houses Zwiefalten Abbey's original clockwork, taken by King Frederick I in 1809.The two pavilions to the west and east of the corps de logis are connected to it by arcaded galleries, completed in 1713 and 1715 respectively, that close off the northern edge of the cour d'honneur. The western gallery celebrates peace with stucco statuary, medallions, and reliefs of the Judgement of Paris, Aeneas fleeing Troy, Hercules and Omphale, and Apollo and Daphne. Its terminus, the Jagdpavillon (Hunting pavilion), contains the Marmorsaletta (Little marble hall) decorated with scagliola by Riccardo Retti and frescoes by Luca Antonio Colomba. Adjoined to the hall are three cabinet rooms, the first and third of which are decorated with Turkish and Chinese imagery respectively. The eastern gallery celebrates war with stucco trophy captives and weapons, reliefs of Eberhard Louis's monogram, and depictions of the cardinal virtues and the classical elements. Spanning the entire gallery is Colomba's ceiling fresco of the Gigantomachy, the war between the Olympian gods and the giants. At the end of the gallery is the Spielpavillon, completed in 1716, whose center is a rounded, cruciform hall with four corner rooms that contain imitation Delftware images of Jacques Callot's Grotesque Dwarves. The dome fresco by Colomba and Emanuel Wohlhaupter depicts the four seasons and their corresponding zodiac signs.\n\n\n=== East wing ===\n\nThe first structure of the eastern wing is the Riesenbau (Giants' building), built by Johann Friedrich Nette in 1712\u201313. The vestibule, decorated by Andreas Quittainer and Colomba, prominently features two sphinxes and four giants as the atlases under the staircase to the beletage. Originally, these stairs led up to a room for the Hunting Order, which was segregated into residences from 1720 to 1723. Ahead of the giants is a statue of Minerva, and the frescoes on the ceiling above the staircase show Justitia and Fortitudo, the four seasons, and the four classical elements. In 1810, the rooms on the beletage were remodeled in the Neoclassical style, but they were restored to the Baroque style and opened as a museum in the 1950s. The apartments of Frederick Louis and Charles Alexander were decorated by Frisoni and Colomba, but Charles Alexander's apartment also features a landscape painting by Adolf Friedrich Harper.Directly south of the Riesenbau is the \u00d6stlicher Kavalierbau (East Cavaliers' Building), built from 1715 to 1719 for housing courtiers. It contains four apartments on both floors, decorated with stucco ornament by Riccardo Retti and an original fresco on the ceiling of the beletage by Leopoldo Retti. The southwestern apartment on the second floor contains a museum dedicated to the Schlosstheater (Palace theater), attached by a gallery to the \u00d6stlicher Kavalierbau and the Schlosskapelle. Europe's oldest theater was constructed by Frisoni from 1729 to 1733 but was first furnished in 1758\u201359 by La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re, who added the stage, auditorium, and machinery. Thouret remodeled the Schlosstheater in Neoclassical in 1811\u201312. Casanova is known to have visited the Schlosstheater, making notes on the performances held there.\n\nThe Schlosskapelle (Palace chapel) was built from 1716 to 1724. The chapel is made up of a rotunda with three semi-domes and a private box for the duke and his family, accessed from the second floor. The box was painted around 1731 with the story of David and given its red velvet wallpaper and a ceiling fresco by Livio Retti. The chapel was painted by Frisoni, Colomba, and Carlo Carlone, who were restricted by Protestant doctrine to illustrations of biblical topics, such as the Apostles and scenes from the Old Testament. A crypt under the chapel is the burial site of all rulers of W\u00fcrttemberg from Duke Eberhard Louis to King Frederick I. The Schlosskapelle did not receive any major remodeling in the 19th century.The southernmost part of the east wing is the Ahnengalerie, built in 1729 and 490-foot (150 m) long. The original ceiling frescoes by Carlo Carlone, which illustrate the story of Achilles, were moved to the Bildergalerie after their completion in 1732. Instead, Carlone painted an homage to Eberhard Louis from 1731 to 1733, glorifying his reign with depictions of Alexander the Great, Apelles, Venus, Mars, Apollo, Phobos, and the Muses, among others. Frederick I had Thouret remodel the Ahnengalerie in 1805\u201306, retaining Carlone's frescoes and adding stucco to the two antechambers. The portraits in the Ahnengalerie trace the lineage of the rulers of W\u00fcrttemberg from Eberhard I the Bearded, the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, to Wilhelm II, the last King of W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n\n=== West wing ===\n\nThe first building of the west wing is the Ordensbau (Order building, in reference to the ducal Order of the Golden Eagle), containing three apartments on the ground floor and the banquet hall. The vestibule features a ceiling fresco of Pheme with a genius. Pictures of Hercules adorn its walls and continue into the stairwell. The antechamber of the Order Hall is decorated with stucco reliefs of cherubs, masks, birds, and weapons by Tomasso Soldati and Frisoni. The Order Hall's stucco was also by Soldati and Frisoni, but the ceiling fresco is a later repainting by Scotti and Baroffio in 1731, as the original by Colomba was damaged by water and removed. King Frederick I had the Hall renovated into a throne room in 1805\u201306 and moved the ceremonies of the Order to the Ordenskapelle. Thouret designed the king's throne and baldachin, opposite Johann Baptist Seele's 1808 portrait of the king. It was in the Order Hall that the constitutions of the Kingdom and the Free People's State of W\u00fcrttemberg were ratified in 1819 and 1919, respectively.Immediately southwest of the Ordensbau is the oval Ordenskapelle (Order chapel), built from 1715 to 1723. The Ordenskapelle was remodeled from 1746 to 1748 by Johann Christoph David von Leger on behalf of Duke Charles Eugene for Duchess Elisabeth Fredericka. Leger removed the floor between the chapel and a second-floor Order hall and reused existing pilasters for new Rococo decor by Pietro Brilli. Retti painted scenes from the life of Jesus on the ceiling. On the second floor is the duchess's box, decorated in 1747\u201348 with stucco and frescoes of the birth of Christ and allegories of faith, hope, and love. In 1798, Frederick I moved the Ordenskapelle's church functions to the Schlosskapelle. Nine years later, he designated it for use by the Order of the Golden Eagle and tasked Thouret with remodeling it in the Empire style. Thouret walled up the first-floor windows in 1807\u201308 for additional seating room and for the king's canopied throne under its star-studded semidome.The Westlicher Kavalierbau (West Cavaliers' building) is attached to the Ordenskapelle, identical in layout and design to its eastern counterpart. It was built in 1719\u201320, and retains some original stucco and ceiling frescoes by Riccardo and Retti. The Festinbau, attached to the Westlicher Kavalierbau, was originally designed as a kitchen built from 1729 to 1733, and used from 1770 to 1775 as a theater. Since 2004, the Westlicher Kavalierbau and Festinbau have housed a fashion museum. The actual kitchen, the K\u00fcchenbau, was built separate from the palace to its west, to keep odors and possible fires at bay. Inside are seven hearths, a bakery, a butcher's shop, several pantries, and the quarters for the servant staff in the attic and on the first floor.The Bildergalerie (Picture gallery), the southernmost part of the west wing, was built by Frisoni in 1731\u201332. The only remaining Baroque decor is Scotti's ceiling fresco depicting the life of Achilles, which first adorned the ceiling of the Ahnengalerie. Thouret renovated the Bildergalerie in Tuscan Neoclassicism from 1803 to 1805, adding a fireplace by Isopi and a statue of Apollo opposite it. The frescoes in the Bildergalerie's antechambers were painted in 1730 by either Scotti or Carlo Carlone.\n\n\n=== South wing (Neuer Hauptbau) ===\nThe south wing, the Neuer Hauptbau (New Main building), was designed and constructed by Frisoni on the order of Duke Eberhard Louis, who found that the Alter Hauptbau was too small to serve the needs of his court. Frisoni planned for a four-story building in 1725 but wound up building three stories. Eberhard Louis died before he could move into the Neuer Hauptbau, leaving its interiors unfinished until Duke Charles Eugene finished them in 1747, but abandoned the palace in 1775. The next royals to reside there were W\u00fcrttemberg's first King and Queen, Frederick I and Charlotte Mathilde, who extensively remodeled parts of the palace in the Neoclassical style from 1802 to 1824. The building was used in 1944\u201345 to store furnishings recovered from the recently destroyed New Palace in Stuttgart.\n\nThe Neuer Hauptbau opens with an oval vestibule decorated by Carlo Carlone. It houses a statue of Duke Eberhard Louis, surrounded by terms supporting the ceiling. In the niches behind the columns are statues of Apollo, a woman and a sphinx, and two maenads with a satyr. A vaulted passageway decorated with two figures of Hercules leads into a salon, featuring a ceiling fresco by Diego Carlone and statues of Roman deities in niches. The King's and Queen's Staircases bookend the vestibule and lead up to the Neuer Hauptbau's beletage. The King's Staircase has statuary themed after unhappy romances, and the cavettos above are adorned with stucco depictions of the seasons personified and medals bearing Eberhard Louis's initials. The Queen's Staircase is a mirror of the King's, but the statuary depicts virtues and the ribbonwork above displays Apollo, Artemis, and the four classical elements.Two galleries lead from the stairs to a guardroom decorated by Diego Carlone in 1730 with stucco weapon trophies and fresco. Thouret covered over Carlone's work with Neoclassical ornamentation in 1815. The guardroom leads into the Marble Hall (Marmorsaal), the palatial dining hall once used to receive Francis II of Austria and Alexander I of Russia. Thouret began work here in 1813\u201314 by installing a new, curved ceiling and finished two years later with the Marble Hall's scagliola walls. Pilasters and windows form the lower wall, decorated with stucco garlands and candelabras by Antonio Isopi. Reproductions of the Medusa Rondanini, Hermes Ludovisi, and the Medici Vase are present around the doors. Above the hall is a walkway in the attica, divided by pillars clad with caryatids holding plates and pitchers designed by Johann Heinrich von Dannecker. The ceiling fresco, by Pernaux, is of a partly cloudy blue sky that contains an eagle and four smaller birds that each hoist a chandelier. The roof above the Marble Hall, though curved, has no visible supports. This was achieved by cantilevering its weight upon the entablatures at the top of the walls of the Marble Hall.\n\nTo the east of the Marble Hall is Queen Charlotte's apartment, originally the suites intended to house Prince Frederick Louis and Princess Henrietta Maria. When Charlotte joined Frederick I in residence at Ludwigsburg in 1798, the separating walls were removed to form one suite. Thouret only made small changes to the queen's suite from 1802 to 1806, principally adding damask to the primary antechamber and to the assembly and audience rooms. Extensive renovations, lasting from 1816 to 1824, came after the queen fully established herself at Ludwigsburg. Charlotte's audience chamber contains her throne, red silk walls, and paintings of Cybele, Minerva, and personified virtues by Viktor Heideloff over the doors and in the lunettes of the mirrors. The adjacent bedroom was remodeled in 1824 with marbled green pilasters and an alcove containing red silk from 1760. The study is unusual for a Neoclassical interior because of its large mirrors. Finally, there is the summer study and the queen's library, remodeled in 1818 with blue damask and Rococo overdoors that carry over into the library to the west. The entire apartment is furnished in the Biedermeier style by Johannes Klinckerfu\u00df, whose work Charlotte herself covered with embroidery.\n\nThe king's apartment, to the west of Charlotte's, was to house Duke Eberhard Louis and Wilhelmine von Gr\u00e4venitz, and later Johanna Elisabeth of Baden-Durlach. Charles Eugene became the first to reside here in 1744 with his wife. When Frederick I took up residence, he had Thouret remodel his 12-room suite from 1802 to 1811. The suite opens with the antechamber, containing decorations dated to 1785, likely taken from Hohenheim Palace, and an original ceiling fresco by Carlo Carlone of Bacchus and Venus. Adjacent to it is the audience chamber, decorated with Baroque red damask and Neoclassical borders. The room contains Frederick's throne and furniture by Isopi, embellished with griffins in relief. Past the conference room and its Rococo overdoors by Heideloff are the king's bedchambers. The Baroque wooden wall paneling and overdoors survived the room's 1811 remodeling. The walls and furnishings of the king's office are Neoclassical, decorated with the heads of Greek gods and cornucopias, but the ceiling fresco is a Guibal original from 1779 of Chronos and Clio.Duke Charles Eugene moved into the Neuer Hauptbau in 1757 and tasked La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re with the apartment's decoration. Two years later, La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re completed the entire suite except for the bedchamber, as the Duke occupied his wife's former suite in 1760 for his actual residence. The rest of the suite was used for social functions until it was emptied of furnishings in the next decade. A staircase and antechamber lead to the entrance of today's apartment, a gallery decorated by Ludovico Bossi. The initial rooms are the first and second antechambers, clad in green damask with portraits by Antoine Pesne and paneling by Michel Fressancourt, overdoors by Matth\u00e4us G\u00fcnther, boiserie flooring, and furniture by Jacques-Philippe Carel and Jean-Baptiste H\u00e9douin that Charles Eugene acquired around 1750. The Assembly Room, restored in 2003, prominently features overdoors by Adolf Friedrich Harper and trophies of musical instruments above the windows. Charles Eugene's third-floor residence begins with the Corner Room, again painted by Harper, which feeds into a cabinet room and then finally the bedchamber, completed in 1770. Bossi created the ceiling's stucco in 1759\u201360, but the room and its two closets took another decade to complete. Additional rooms on the third floor housed relatives of the rulers of W\u00fcrttemberg and these have been occupied by the Ceramics Museum since 2004.\n\n\n== Grounds and gardens ==\n\nThe gardens were to be centered in the north with an Italian terraced garden and were largely completed when Eberhard Louis turned his attention to the south garden. There he laid out a large symmetrical French garden. Charles Eugene filled in the terraces in 1749 to replace them with a large broderie. He then reorganized and expanded the south garden over the next decade. Frederick I again reorganized the south garden in 1797 in a Neoclassical style and Mediterranean theme. He retained the original pathways, but added a canal and fountain to the garden's center. The south garden was divided into four equally sized lawns, with hillocks in their center topped with a large vase crafted by Antonio Isopi. Frederick also expanded the garden east to form an English landscape garden (Lower east) and demolished Charles Eugene's opera house to form a medieval-themed landscape garden (Upper east). Two additional gardens, for Frederick and Charlotte, were laid out adjacent to their palace suites. Also in the fantasy garden is the Emichsburg, a folly built from 1798 to 1802 and named after the fabled ancestor of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, a knight of the House of Hohenstaufen. William I abandoned Ludwigsburg for Rosenstein Palace in Stuttgart and opened the south garden to the public in 1828. The canal was filled in and an orchard planted on the southern lawns, later used to grow potatoes.\n\nIn 1947, Albert Sch\u00f6chle, Director of the State Parks and Gardens Authority, was charged with maintaining the gardens. After visiting the 1951 Bundesgartenschau in Hanover, he decided to restore the gardens. Sch\u00f6chle convinced Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's Minister of Finance Karl Frank to help fund the venture in 1952 on the condition that the town of Ludwigsburg also assisted. Ludwigsburg's mayor, Elmar Doch, and the town council agreed to this stipulation. Frank approved the start of work on 23 March 1953, but it lasted late into the year. The restoration of the garden required the moving of 100,000 cubic meters (3,531,467 cu ft) of earth by bulldozers supplied and operated by American soldiers and the planting of tens of thousands of trees and hedges, 22,000 roses, and 400,000 other flowers. The Blooming Baroque (Bl\u00fchendes Barock) gardens were opened on 23 April 1954 as a special horticultural show and attracted more than 500,000 visitors by the end of May, among them President Theodor Heuss. When the show closed in the fall of 1954, it had recouped all but 150,000 Deutsche Marks of the investment in the restoration of the gardens and became a permanent landmark. The opening of the Fairy-Tale Garden and its recreations of fairy-tales in 1959 was also an immediate success and increased revenue by 50% for that year. The Blooming Baroque gardens, covering an area of 32 hectares (79 acres), attract 520,000 to 550,000 visitors annually.\n\n\n=== Schloss Favorite ===\n\nBy 1710 Eberhard Louis had decided to use Ludwigsburg as his main residence, but he still desired a hunting retreat. Inspired by a garden palace he had seen in Vienna, he tasked Frisoni with the design of a new Rococo palace on a hill to the north of Ludwigsburg. Frisoni largely completed Favorite within that year but was unable to complete his extensive plans for its grounds. Only the roads to the main palace and to Monrepos Palace were laid out. In 1800, the interior was remodeled by Thouret for Frederick I. Only one room, in the western half of the building, retains its original baroque appearance. When Frederick was appointed an elector in 1803 and then a king in 1806, he chose both times to celebrate the occasion at Schloss Favorite. Favorite fell into disrepair in the 20th century but was extensively restored from 1972 to 1982.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nOn the first and third floors of the Alter Hauptbau is the Baroque Gallery (Barockgalerie), a subsidiary museum of the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart opened in 2004. It displays 120 paintings, some of which are originals from a purchase Duke Charles Alexander made in 1736 of about 400 paintings from Gustav Adolf von Gotter. Examples of German and Italian Baroque paintings on display include Martin van Meytens's portrait of Charles Alexander, works by Johann Heinrich Sch\u00f6nfeld, Carl Borrom\u00e4us Andreas Ruthart, Johann Heiss, and Katharina Treu, as well as works that formerly were in the collection of Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nThe Landesmuseum W\u00fcrttemberg maintains two subsidiary museums at Ludwigsburg Palace, the Ceramics Museum and Fashion Museum (Keramikmuseum and Modemuseum, respectively), both opened in 2004. The first of these takes up all of the third floor of the Neuer Hauptbau except the apartment of Duke Charles Eugene, a space of 2,000 square meters (22,000 sq ft) containing more than 4,500 exhibits of porcelain, ceramics, faience and pottery, and of their history, making it one of the largest collections of ceramics in Europe. It includes 2,000 pieces of original Ludwigsburg porcelain and 800 pieces of maiolica, purchased by Charles Eugene from dealers in Augsburg and Nuremberg. It also includes porcelain from the manufactories at Meissen, Berlin, S\u00e8vres, and Vienna, and 20th century Art Nouveau pieces purchased from six countries since 1950. The Fashion Museum, housed in the Festinbau and West Kavalierbau, displays about 700 pieces of clothing and accessories from the 1750s to the 1960s, including works by Charles Frederick Worth, Paul Poiret, Christian Dior, and Issey Miyake.On the ground floor of the Neuer Hauptbau is a lapidarium, housing original Baroque statuary by Andreas Quittainer, Johann Wilhelm Beyer and Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Lejeune. Charles Eugene's apartment houses the Princess Olga Cabinet Exhibition, exploring the lives of Princess Olga and her family at Ludwigsburg from 1901 to 1932.Kinderreich (Children's Kingdom) is an interactive museum that educates children four years and older about life at the court of the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg. In the Palace Theatre, about 140 original set pieces and props from the 18th and 19th centuries are preserved that were discovered during restoration of the theatre, such as oil lamps used for stage lighting. These items were extensively restored to their original condition from 1987 to 1995, and since 1995 one of the original stage pieces, a winter background, has been used for the Junge B\u00fchne (Young stage).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Baroque residences\nNew Palace (Stuttgart)\nW\u00fcrzburg Residence\nPalace of Versailles\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\nNews sources\n\n\n=== Web sources ===\n\nGerman Federal and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State governments (in German)\nCity of Ludwigsburg\nS\u00fcddeutscher Barock (in German)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "I'm not one for taking towards like this but this one was okay. It's nice to imagine the history and quite impressive as you walk through the palace. I probably wouldn't do it a second time though",
          "We did not go into the palace because we hit the gardens first and ran out of time. Not because we did not budget a day here (we did), but because we spent hours exploring the gardens and could not get enough of their charm. We were lucky enough to visit during the pumpkin",
          "A must do, absolutely! If you're staying in Stuttgart, it's definitely worth the trip out there, but make sure you are there in time for the guided tour! It was the best guided tour of a palace I've ever had! The tour guide was fantastic, and did a good job of going through the",

          "...when visiting Ludwigsburg - do not miss it! Excellent tours through the castle in English with great details and a lot of interesting background stories. The owners were not as crazy as the famous king Ludwig in Bavaria, but there are also freaky parts in that",
          "There is nothing to dislike! The tour was perfect in length, very informative but not too much. The palace is huge with over 140 rooms. We got to tour the entire second floor that was about 67 rooms. I enjoyed this palace more than any other castle or palace I have ever visited!",
          "Awesome experience. The guide was one of the best we have ever had on our travels. The gardens are indescribable. The theatre in the castle, the church, etc are amazingly beautiful. The 3d paintings had me in awe. I have never seen such beautiful 3d painted ceilings!",

          "The palace was well worth the train ride from Stuttgart. The place is very large and the English tour was good but relatively fast for the amount of area to be covered. Be sure to stop the guide and ask as many questions as you can. What was interesting was that much of what's",
          "Our visit to the Palace was something we will never forget. The buildings and statutes were well worth seeing. The thing that drew us to the palace was the gardens. There is one footpath which my friend told me to go up. As soon as you step onto it a fountain starts beneath you",
          "This is the real deal! You are standing not only in the castle, but among the original fabrics, and trimmings from the sixteenth century. It sent a chill up my spine in more than one room. The tour can feel a bit rushed depending on which tour guide you get, but it is quite good",

          "Who woulda thunk it...we decided to just take a weekend day trip, and were overwhelmed that Ludwigsburg contains a pearl. It was more important than Stuttgart, in its day. It's got the ageless beauty of many of Europe's more well-known landmarks. And, while I agree that you can",

          "If you are able to, plan your visit to the Palace during the pumpkin festival season. The fest is located throughout the gardens of the palace. They have over 400,000 pumpkins on display, pumpkin food and drinks and it is a great way to spend the afternoon with your friends",
          "This is certainly a very large palace, in fact there are two. You pay for the both and the gardens but you can buy an all in ticket if you have all day. There are only English tours at certain times so check before you go. You have to have a tour and there are no audio headsets",

          "I honestly have to say I was blown away by the whole experience. I had no idea this place even existed after being in Germany about 10 times in the last 25 years. You can spend the whole day on a lengthy tour (~2 hours), in the gardens all over the palace grounds (~2-3 hours),",

          "This is a must see we got there early on a weekday. We easily got on a English tour. Our tour guide was great she was really knowledgeable and took time to answer any question in each room we were in. They were cleaning and working in one room we were supposed to have went in",
          "The palace is enormous. For me the best part are the gardens. You need to wear comfy shoes and allow a lot of time because you'll have a lot of walking to do!! A must with children is the fairy tale garden. While we were there, there was also a straw festival on. Very impressive",
          "We visited Residenzschloss a week ago. Since there is not much to do in Stuttgart, visiting Ludwigsburg was a perfect activity to do. We took S5 train from Stuttgart Main Station and easily found the palace. They did not have an English guide and unfortunately you have to exlore",

          "There is an English tour guide, Martina, who can probably find the most boring room anywhere and make it interesting. Room after room, she brought the palace to life with stories of those who lived there before. I only wish we were able to take pictures. Other than the palace",

        "wiki": "Stuttgart ( SHTUUT-gart, also US:  STU(U)T-, STOOT-, SHTOOT-; German: [\u02c8\u0283t\u028at\u0261a\u0281t] (listen); Swabian: Schduagert [\u02c8\u0292\u030ad\u0325ua\u032f\u0261\u030a\u025b\u0295d\u0325]; names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:\n\nThe Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534. Exterior: Romanesque/Gothic; interior: Romanesque/Gothic/Modern. Reconstructed with simplified interior after World War II.\nAltes Schloss (the Old Castle), mostly dating from the late 15th century, some parts date back to 1320. Renaissance style; reconstructed\nAlte Kanzlei (the Old Chancellery) on Schillerplatz square which backs onto the 1598 Mercury Pillar\nNeues Schloss (the New Castle), completed in 1807. Baroque/Classicism); reconstructed with modern interior, currently houses government offices. The cellars with a collection of stone fragments from the Roman times are open to visitors\nWilhelmpalais (the King Wilhelm Palais), 1840\nK\u00f6nigsbau (the King's Building), 1850. Classicism; reconstructed; has been housing the \"K\u00f6nigsbau Passagen\" shopping centre since 2006.\nThe Gro\u00dfes Haus of Stuttgart National Theatre, 1909\u20131912\nMarkthalle Market Hall, 1910. (Art Nouveau)\nThe Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) was designed in 1920; its stark, functional lines are typical of the artistic trend 'Neue Sachlichkeit' (New Objectivity)\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek state library, rebuilt in 1970.\nFriedrichsbau Variet\u00e9 (Friedrich Building), rebuilt in 1994 on the site of the former art nouveau building\n\n\n=== Architecture in other districts ===\n\nA number of significant castles stand in Stuttgart's suburbs and beyond as reminders of the city's royal past. These include:\n\nCastle Solitude, 1700\u20131800. Baroque/Rococo)\nLudwigsburg Palace, 1704\u20131758. Baroque, with its enormous baroque garden.\nCastle Hohenheim, 1771\u20131793Other landmarks in and around Stuttgart include (see also museums below):\n\nCastle Rosenstein (1822\u20131830) Classical\nW\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum (1824) which holds the remains of Catherine Pavlovna of Russia and King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg\nWilhelma Zoo and Botanical Gardens (1853)\nThe Observation Tower of Burgholzhof an 1891 brick observation tower constructed by the Cannstatt municipal architect Friedrich Keppler on behalf of the Versch\u00f6nerungsverein Cannstatt e. V. (\"Society for the Beautification of Cannstatt\"), in the style of a Roman tower.\nWeissenhof Estate (1927), (International Style)\nThe TV Tower (1950), the world's first concrete TV tower\nStuttgart Airport Terminal Building, 2000. In neighboring Leinfelden-Echterdingen\n\n\n=== Parks, lakes, cemeteries and other places of interest ===\n \nAt the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists. Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.\nOther parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandsh\u00f6he hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Wei\u00dfenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at 511 metres (1,677 ft) the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300\u2013400 years old).\n\nThere are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium.

Ludwigsburg Palace in the nearby town of Ludwigsburg is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.\nAs a result of Stuttgart's long history of viticulture (Even today there are vineyards less than 500 m (1,640 ft) from the Main Station), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the \"St\u00e4ffele\") around the city, equivalent to approximately 20 km (12 mi) of steps. Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond. For example, Gaisburger Marsch is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart's Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.\n\nIn October 2009 the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced that the European Union was to officially recognise the pasta dish Maultaschen as a \"regional specialty\", thus marking its significance to the cultural heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.In 1993 Stuttgart hosted the International Garden Show in the suburb of Killesberg. In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the Football World Cup. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.

The Stuttgart-based Pentecostal Gospel Forum is the largest place of worship (megachurch) in Germany. It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy W\u00fcrttemberg until 1806, the W\u00fcrttemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen W\u00fcrttemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart. The archived material is in principle open to the public and can be consulted in the reading room in Bellingweg 21 in Bad Cannstatt.\nThe Landeskirchliche Archives preserve the stocks of the W\u00fcrttemberg church leaders and of other ecclesial bodies and institutions: the ducal and royal W\u00fcrttemberg consistory, the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, deanery and parish archives, educational institutions, the works and associations as well as estates and collections. It also has the microfilms of all church books (especially baptism, marriage, and family Death's Register) in the area of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe \"Archive instigator\" is dedicated to the dead of the city. Since 2005, the instigators are working on a memoir about \"The dead town\". So far, about 5,000 names of victims of the regime of National Socialism have been acquired.\nThere are two large tours that are available to visitors to Stuttgart. The first is the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (also called the CityTour Stuttgart), lasting from 10 AM to 4 PM that takes visitors around the city. The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Some of its most prominent companies include Daimler AG, Porsche, Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sika \u2013 all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.\nStuttgart is home to Germany's ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nThe city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg after Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and Freiburg. Founded in 1829, it was a Technische Hochschule (\"Technical University\") until 1967, when it was renamed to \"university\". Its campus for social sciences and architecture is located in the city centre, near the main train station, while the natural science campus is in the southwestern city district of Vaihingen. Historically, it has been especially renowned for its faculty of architecture (Stuttgarter Schule). Today, its main focus is on engineering and other technical subjects.\nUniversity of Hohenheim, founded in 1818 as an academy for agricultural science and forestry. While these subjects are still taught there today, its other focus today is on business administration.

Friedrich Schiller and the city's most famous Classicist architect, Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, were among its many esteemed alumni.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nThe first Waldorf School (also known as Rudolf Steiner School) was founded here in 1919 by the director of the Waldorf Astoria tobacco factory, Emil Molt, and Austrian social thinker Rudolf Steiner, a comprehensive school following Steiner's educational principles of anthroposophy and humanistic ideals. Today, four of these schools are located in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== International School ===\nSince 1985 Stuttgart is home to the International School of Stuttgart, one of fewer than 100 schools worldwide that offer all three International Baccalaureate programs- the IB Primary Years (Early Learning to Grade 5), IB Middle Years (Grade 6 to 10), IB Diploma (grades 11\u201312). The International School of Stuttgart is accredited by both the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.\n\n\n== Media and publishing ==\nOne of the headquarters of the public S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR; Southwest Broadcasting) channels (several radio and one TV channel; regional focus on the southwestern German States of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate) is located in Stuttgart (the other ones being Baden-Baden and Mainz). It also has a Landesmedienzentrum, a State media center.\nFurthermore, the city is a significant centre of publishing and specialist printing, with renowned houses such as Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, Ernst Klett Verlag (schoolbooks), Kohlhammer Verlag, Metzler Verlag and Motor Presse having their head offices there. The Reclam Verlag is located in nearby Ditzingen.\nThe newspapers Stuttgarter Zeitung (StZ; regional, with significant supra-regional, national and international sections) and Stuttgarter Nachrichten (StN; regional) are published here as well as a number of smaller, local papers such as Cannstatter Zeitung.\nAs is the case wherever the US military is stationed, there is an American Forces Network (AFN) station. It transmits on FM on 102.3 MHz from Fernmeldeturm Frauenkopf and on AM on 1143 kHz from Hirschlanden transmitter.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFollowing the suit of other German cities such as Berlin, Cologne and Hanover, on 1 March 2008 a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) came into effect in Stuttgart with the aim of improving air quality. This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (Umweltzone), including vehicles from abroad.\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\n\nStuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a 'U' symbol, which stands for Untergrundbahn (underground rail). Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfenbahnen AG (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the Stuttgart S-Bahn, using tracks supplied by the national Deutsche Bahn AG (DB).\nA peculiarity of Stuttgart is the Zahnradbahn, a rack railway that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch. It is the only urban rack railway in Germany. Stuttgart also has a Standseilbahn, a funicular railway that operates in the Heslach area and the forest cemetery (Waldfriedhof). In Killesberg Park, on a prominent hill overlooking the city, there is the miniature railway run by diesel (and on weekends with steam).\n\n\n=== Rail links ===\n\nStuttgart is a hub in the Intercity-Express and Intercity networks of Deutsche Bahn AG (DB), with through services to most other major German cities. It also operates international services to Strasbourg, Vienna, Z\u00fcrich and Paris (five times a day, journey time 3 hours 11 minutes).Long-distance trains stop at Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, the city's main line terminus, which is also used by Interregio-Express, Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains for services to stations in the Stuttgart metropolitan area. The local rail networks (see above) operate underneath the terminus.Stuttgart also has its own rail freight centre with marshalling yards and a container terminal in the Obert\u00fcrkheim area of Hedelfingen.\n\n\n=== Rail: The Stuttgart 21 project ===\nAfter years of political debate and controversy, plans were approved in October 2007 to convert the existing above-ground main train station to an underground through station. The Stuttgart 21 project will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart's enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and should be completed in 2020.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Stuttgart Airport (German: Flughafen Stuttgart, IATA airport code STR), an international airport approximately 13 km (8 mi) south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns. It takes 30 minutes to reach the airport from the city center using S-Bahn lines S2 or S3. Stuttgart airport is Germany's only international airport with one runway. Despite protests and local initiatives, surveys are currently underway to assess the impact of a second runway.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Autobahn A8, that runs east\u2013west from Karlsruhe to Munich, and Autobahn A81 that runs north\u2013south from W\u00fcrzburg to Singen. The Autobahn A831 is a short spur entering the southern side of Stuttgart.\n\nBesides these Autobahns, Stuttgart is served by a large number of expressways, many of which are built to Autobahn standards, and were once intended to carry an A-number. Important expressways like B10, B14, B27 and B29 connect Stuttgart with its suburbs. Due to the hilly surroundings, there are many road tunnels in and around Stuttgart. There are also a number of road tunnels under intersections in the center of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\nStuttgart has an inland port in Hedelfingen on the Neckar.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nAs in the rest of Germany, football is the most popular sport in Stuttgart which is home to 'The Reds' and 'The Blues'. 'The Reds', VfB Stuttgart, are the most famous and popular local club. An established team currently playing in the German 2.

        "wiki": "The Rosenstein Park (German: Rosensteinpark) in Stuttgart is the largest English garden in southwest Germany. Its creation took place from 1824 to 1840 on the orders of King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg after plans of his gardener Johann Bosch on the former Kahlenstein area. From 1817 to 1818 King William I had purchased all land on the Kahlenstein from the citizens of Cannstatt.\nIn the middle of the park the Rosenstein Palace was built from 1822 to 1830. The Wilhelma zoo and the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart are also located in the park. The L\u00f6wentor (Lion's Gate) at the upper park entrance was built by Giovanni Salucci. The Rosensteintunnel is a railway tunnel beneath the park.\nToday the park is owned by the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and preserved as a historical monument. In conjunction with the Schlossgarten, the Leibfried Garden, the Wartberg and the Killesbergpark it forms Stuttgart's \u201eGreen U\u201c. Because of the ban on hunting within the park it boasts 98.9 hares per 100 ha, the highest concentration of hares in Germany.\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article was translated from the German Wikipedia article (August 15, 2010), version [1].",

Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:\n\nThe Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534.

Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.\nOther parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandsh\u00f6he hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Wei\u00dfenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at 511 metres (1,677 ft) the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300\u2013400 years old).\n\nThere are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium.

The Staatstheater is home to the State opera and three smaller theatres. It regularly stages opera, ballet and theatre productions as well as concerts. The Staatstheater was named Germany/Austria/Switzerland \"Theatre of the year\" in 2006; the Stuttgart Opera has won the 'Opera of the year' award six times.

Ludwigsburg Palace in the nearby town of Ludwigsburg is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.\nAs a result of Stuttgart's long history of viticulture (Even today there are vineyards less than 500 m (1,640 ft) from the Main Station), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the \"St\u00e4ffele\") around the city, equivalent to approximately 20 km (12 mi) of steps. Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond. For example, Gaisburger Marsch is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart's Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.\n\nIn October 2009 the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced that the European Union was to officially recognise the pasta dish Maultaschen as a \"regional specialty\", thus marking its significance to the cultural heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.In 1993 Stuttgart hosted the International Garden Show in the suburb of Killesberg. In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the Football World Cup. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. In 2008 it was host to the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships. In 2015 Stuttgart hosted the Protestant Kirchentag (Chuchfestival)\nRegular events that take place in Stuttgart:\n\nThe world-famous annual 'Volksfest', originally a traditional agricultural fair which now also hosts beer tents and a French village and is second in size only to the Oktoberfest in Munich. There is also a Spring festival on the same grounds in April of each year.\nWith more than 3.6 million visitors in 2007 and more than 200 stands, Stuttgart's Christmas Market, running from late November to 23 December, is the largest and one of the oldest traditional Christmas markets in Europe.

The Stuttgart-based Pentecostal Gospel Forum is the largest place of worship (megachurch) in Germany. It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy W\u00fcrttemberg until 1806, the W\u00fcrttemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen W\u00fcrttemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart.

It also has the microfilms of all church books (especially baptism, marriage, and family Death's Register) in the area of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe \"Archive instigator\" is dedicated to the dead of the city. Since 2005, the instigators are working on a memoir about \"The dead town\". So far, about 5,000 names of victims of the regime of National Socialism have been acquired.\nThere are two large tours that are available to visitors to Stuttgart. The first is the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (also called the CityTour Stuttgart), lasting from 10 AM to 4 PM that takes visitors around the city. The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Some of its most prominent companies include Daimler AG, Porsche, Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sika \u2013 all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.\nStuttgart is home to Germany's ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nThe city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg after Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and Freiburg. Founded in 1829, it was a Technische Hochschule (\"Technical University\") until 1967, when it was renamed to \"university\". Its campus for social sciences and architecture is located in the city centre, near the main train station, while the natural science campus is in the southwestern city district of Vaihingen. Historically, it has been especially renowned for its faculty of architecture (Stuttgarter Schule).

This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (Umweltzone), including vehicles from abroad.\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\n\nStuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a 'U' symbol, which stands for Untergrundbahn (underground rail). Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfenbahnen AG (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the Stuttgart S-Bahn, using tracks supplied by the national Deutsche Bahn AG (DB).\nA peculiarity of Stuttgart is the Zahnradbahn, a rack railway that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch.

The Stuttgart 21 project will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart's enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and should be completed in 2020.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Stuttgart Airport (German: Flughafen Stuttgart, IATA airport code STR), an international airport approximately 13 km (8 mi) south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns.

        "wiki": "The Stadtmuseum Stuttgart (City Museum Stuttgart) (proprietary name: StadtPalais \u2013 Museum for Stuttgart) is a museum about the history of Stuttgart. It was opened in April of 2018 in the Wilhelm Palais, the former residence of W\u00fcrttembergs last King William II. The Stadtbibliothek Stuttgart, the public library of the city of Stuttgart, was also housed there from 1965 until 2011.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1998 Stuttgart's city council made the decision to build a new central library for the city. In 2011 the library at the Mail\u00e4nder Platz in the Europaviertel was completed. Now that the library has moved the opportunity to create a museum about the city's history in the Wilhelm Palais arose. In 2009 a competition for the realization of such a museum was held. It was won by the office of Lederer+Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir+Oei in cooperation with Jangled Nerves. After a makeover of their proposal, on 26 February 2010 the jury unanimously decided in favor of further processing the idea on the foundation of the proposal.

        "wiki": "Stuttgart ( SHTUUT-gart, also US:  STU(U)T-, STOOT-, SHTOOT-; German: [\u02c8\u0283t\u028at\u0261a\u0281t] (listen); Swabian: Schduagert [\u02c8\u0292\u030ad\u0325ua\u032f\u0261\u030a\u025b\u0295d\u0325]; names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:\n\nThe Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534. Exterior: Romanesque/Gothic; interior: Romanesque/Gothic/Modern. Reconstructed with simplified interior after World War II.\nAltes Schloss (the Old Castle), mostly dating from the late 15th century, some parts date back to 1320. Renaissance style; reconstructed\nAlte Kanzlei (the Old Chancellery) on Schillerplatz square which backs onto the 1598 Mercury Pillar\nNeues Schloss (the New Castle), completed in 1807. Baroque/Classicism); reconstructed with modern interior, currently houses government offices. The cellars with a collection of stone fragments from the Roman times are open to visitors\nWilhelmpalais (the King Wilhelm Palais), 1840\nK\u00f6nigsbau (the King's Building), 1850. Classicism; reconstructed; has been housing the \"K\u00f6nigsbau Passagen\" shopping centre since 2006.\nThe Gro\u00dfes Haus of Stuttgart National Theatre, 1909\u20131912\nMarkthalle Market Hall, 1910. (Art Nouveau)\nThe Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station) was designed in 1920; its stark, functional lines are typical of the artistic trend 'Neue Sachlichkeit' (New Objectivity)\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek state library, rebuilt in 1970.\nFriedrichsbau Variet\u00e9 (Friedrich Building), rebuilt in 1994 on the site of the former art nouveau building\n\n\n=== Architecture in other districts ===\n\nA number of significant castles stand in Stuttgart's suburbs and beyond as reminders of the city's royal past. These include:\n\nCastle Solitude, 1700\u20131800. Baroque/Rococo)\nLudwigsburg Palace, 1704\u20131758. Baroque, with its enormous baroque garden.\nCastle Hohenheim, 1771\u20131793Other landmarks in and around Stuttgart include (see also museums below):\n\nCastle Rosenstein (1822\u20131830) Classical\nW\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum (1824) which holds the remains of Catherine Pavlovna of Russia and King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg\nWilhelma Zoo and Botanical Gardens (1853)\nThe Observation Tower of Burgholzhof an 1891 brick observation tower constructed by the Cannstatt municipal architect Friedrich Keppler on behalf of the Versch\u00f6nerungsverein Cannstatt e. V. (\"Society for the Beautification of Cannstatt\"), in the style of a Roman tower.\nWeissenhof Estate (1927), (International Style)\nThe TV Tower (1950), the world's first concrete TV tower\nStuttgart Airport Terminal Building, 2000. In neighboring Leinfelden-Echterdingen\n\n\n=== Parks, lakes, cemeteries and other places of interest ===\n \nAt the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists. Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.\nOther parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandsh\u00f6he hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Wei\u00dfenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at 511 metres (1,677 ft) the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300\u2013400 years old).\n\nThere are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium. Established in 1873 it was extended to include Jewish graves in 1874 and also now houses the Russian Orthodox Church of Alexander Nevsky\nThe Uff-Kirchhof cemetery in Bad Cannstatt which stands at the crossroads of two ancient Roman roads and Cannstatter Hauptfriedhof, the largest graveyard in Stuttgart which has been used as a Muslim burial ground since 1985.The city boasts the largest mineral water deposits in Europe after Budapest, with over 250 springs within the urban area.\n\n\n=== Culture and events ===\n\nStuttgart is known for its rich cultural heritage, in particular its State Theatre (Staatstheater) and State Gallery (Staatsgalerie). The Staatstheater is home to the State opera and three smaller theatres. It regularly stages opera, ballet and theatre productions as well as concerts. The Staatstheater was named Germany/Austria/Switzerland \"Theatre of the year\" in 2006; the Stuttgart Opera has won the 'Opera of the year' award six times. Stuttgart Ballet is connected to names like John Cranko and Marcia Hayd\u00e9e.\nStuttgart is also home to one of Germany's most prestigious symphony orchestras, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra, with famous English conductor Sir Roger Norrington, who developed a distinct sound of that orchestra, known as the Stuttgart Sound.

Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond.

It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in.

The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry.

Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation.

        "wiki": "Carl Zeiss AG (German: [ka\u0281l tsa\u026as]), branded as ZEISS, is a German manufacturer of optical systems and optoelectronics, founded in Jena, Germany in 1846 by optician Carl Zeiss. Together with Ernst Abbe (joined 1866) and Otto Schott (joined 1884) he laid the foundation for today's multi-national company. The current company emerged from a reunification of Carl Zeiss companies in East and West Germany with a consolidation phase in the 1990s. ZEISS is active in four business segments with approximately equal revenue, Industrial Quality and Research, Medical Technology, Consumer Markets and Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology in almost 50 countries, has 30 production sites and around 25 development sites worldwide.Carl Zeiss AG is the holding of all subsidiaries within Zeiss Group, of which Carl Zeiss Meditec AG is the only one that is traded at the stock market. Carl Zeiss AG is owned by the foundation Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung. The Zeiss Group has its headquarters in southern Germany, in the small town Oberkochen with its second largest and founding site being Jena in eastern Germany. Also controlled by the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung is the glass manufacturer Schott AG, located in Mainz and Jena. Carl Zeiss is one of the oldest existing optics manufacturers in the world.\n\n\n== Corporate history ==\n\nCarl Zeiss opened an optics workshop in Jena in 1846. By 1847 he was making microscopes full-time. By 1861 the Zeiss workshop was considered to be among the best scientific-instrument makers in Germany with about 20 people working in the company, and business growing quickly. By 1866 Zeiss sold their 1,000th microscope. In 1872 physicist Ernst Abbe joined Zeiss and along with Otto Schott designed greatly improved lenses for the optical instruments they were producing. After Carl Zeiss's death in 1888, the business was incorporated as the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung in 1889.\nBy World War I, Zeiss was the world's largest location of camera production. Zeiss Ikon represented a significant part of the production along with dozens of other brands and factories, and also had major works at Dresden.\nIn 1928 Hensoldt AG was acquired by Carl Zeiss and has produced the Zeiss binoculars and riflescopes since 1964, occasionally resulting in twin products being offered under both the Hensoldt and Zeiss brand names. The Hensoldt System Technology division (resulting from a merger of the military optics operations of Leica and Hensoldt) was continued by Zeiss under the Hensoldt name until 2006.\nAs part of Nazi Germany Zwangsarbeiter program, Zeiss used forced labour during World War II.\nThe destruction of the war caused many companies to divide into smaller subcompanies and others to merge. There was great respect for the engineering innovation that came out of Dresden\u2014before the war the world's first 35 mm single-lens reflex camera, the Kine Exakta, and the first miniature camera with good picture quality were developed there.\nAt the end of the war, Jena was occupied by the United States Army. When Jena and Dresden were incorporated into the Soviet occupation zone, later East Germany, some parts of Zeiss Jena were relocated by the US army to the Contessa manufacturing facility in Stuttgart, West Germany, while the remainder of Zeiss Jena was reestablished by the (eastern) German Democratic Republic as Kombinat VEB Zeiss Jena. The Soviet Army took most of the existing Zeiss factories and tooling as World War II spoils back to the Soviet Union, establishing the Kiev camera works.\nThe western business was restarted in Oberkochen, southwestern Germany, as Opton Optische Werke Oberkochen GmbH in 1946, which became Zeiss-Opton Optische Werke Oberkochen GmbH in 1947, but was soon renamed to Carl Zeiss. West German Zeiss products were labelled Opton for sale in the Eastern bloc, while East German Zeiss products were labelled \"Zeiss Jena\" or simply \"Jena\" for sale in Western countries.\nIn 1973, the Western Carl Zeiss AG entered into a licensing agreement with the Japanese camera company Yashica to produce a series of high-quality 35 mm film cameras and lenses bearing the Contax and Zeiss brand names. This collaboration continued under Yashica's successor, Kyocera, until the latter ceased all camera production in 2005. Zeiss later produced lenses for the space industry and, more recently, has again produced high-quality 35 mm camera lenses. The eastern Zeiss Jena was also well known for producing high-quality products.\nFollowing German reunification, VEB Zeiss Jena \u2014 reckoned as one of the few East German firms that was even potentially able to compete on a global basis \u2014 became Zeiss Jena GmbH, which became Jenoptik Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH in 1990. In 1991, Jenoptik Carl Zeiss Jena was split in two, with Carl Zeiss AG (Oberkochen) taking over the company's divisions for microscopy and other precision optics (effectively reuniting the pre-war Carl Zeiss enterprise) and moving its microscopy and planetarium divisions back to Jena. Jenoptik GmbH was split off as a specialty company in the areas of photonics, optoelectronics, and mechatronics.The Hensoldt AG was renamed Carl Zeiss Sports Optics GmbH on 1 October 2006.The companies of the Zeiss Gruppe in and around Dresden have branched into new technologies: screens and products for the automotive industry, for example.\nToday, there are arguably three companies with primarily Zeiss Ikon heritage: Zeiss Germany, the Finnish/Swedish Ikon (which bought the West German Zeiss Ikon AG), and the independent eastern Zeiss Ikon.\nA division called Carl Zeiss Vision produces lenses for eyeglasses. In 2005, the eyeglass division merged with U.S. company SOLA, which included the former American Optical Company.On 28 June 2013, Carl Zeiss officially announced its plan to rename the brand from \"Carl Zeiss\" to simply \"Zeiss\". All the products will be standardized under the Zeiss brand.In April 2019, Zeiss announced the acquisition of Braunschweig-based GOM.\n\n\n== Innovations ==\n\nThe Zeiss company was responsible for many innovations in optical design and engineering in each of their major fields of business. Today this becomes exemplarily visible in the latest EUV lithography systems, the equipment needed to produce the latest generations of semiconductor components. It also includes early high performance optical microscopes up to today's electron and ion microscopes, which reach sub-nanometers resolution. It includes technology leadership in early surgical microscopes and ophthalmic devices. It also includes high performance contact metrology systems. For many years Zeiss showed new innovations in fields as astronomical telescopes, photographic and cinematic lenses. \nEarly on, Carl Zeiss realised that he needed a competent scientist so as to take the firm beyond just being another optical workshop. In 1866, the service of Dr. Ernst Abbe was enlisted. From then on novel products appeared in rapid succession which brought the Zeiss company to the forefront of optical technology.\nAbbe was instrumental in the development of the famous Jena optical glass. When he was trying to eliminate stigmatism from microscopes, he realized that the range of optical glasses available was insufficient. After some calculations, he realised that performance of optical instruments would dramatically improve if optical glasses of appropriate properties were available. His challenge to glass manufacturers was finally answered by Dr. Otto Schott, who established the famous glassworks at Jena from which new types of optical glass began to appear from 1888 to be employed by Zeiss and other makers.\nThe new Jena optical glass also opened up the possibility of increased performance of photographic lenses. The first use of Jena glass in a photographic lens was by Voigtl\u00e4nder, but as the lens was an old design its performance was not greatly improved. Subsequently, the new glasses would demonstrate their value in correcting astigmatism, and in the production of apochromatic lenses. Abbe started the design of a photographic lens of symmetrical design with five elements, but went no further.\nZeiss' domination of photographic lens innovation was due to Dr Paul Rudolph. In 1890, Rudolph designed an asymmetrical lens with a cemented group at each side of the diaphragm, appropriately named \"Anastigmat\". This lens was made in three series: Series III, IV and V, with maximum apertures of f/7.2, f/12.5, and f/18 respectively. In 1891, Series I, II and IIIa appeared with respective maximum apertures of f/4.5, f/6.3, and f/9 and in 1893 came Series IIa of f/8 maximum aperture. These lenses are now better known by the trademark \"Protar\", which was first used in 1900.\nAt the time, single combination lenses, which occupy one side of the diaphragm only, were still popular. Rudolph designed one with three cemented elements in 1893, with the option of fitting two of them together in a lens barrel as a compound lens, but it was found to be the same as the Dagor by C.P. Goerz, designed by Emil von Hoegh. Rudolph then came up with a single combination with four cemented elements, which can be considered as having all the elements of the Protar stuck together in one piece. Marketed in 1894, it was called the Protarlinse Series VII, the most highly corrected single combination lens with maximum apertures between f/11 and f/12.5, depending on its focal length.\nBut the important thing about this Protarlinse is that two of these lens units can be mounted in the same lens barrel to form a compound lens of even greater performance and a larger aperture, between f/6.3 and f/7.7. In this configuration, it was called the Double Protar Series VIIa. An immense range of focal lengths can thus be obtained by the various combination of Protarlinse units.\nRudolph also investigated the Double-Gauss concept of a symmetrical design with thin positive menisci enclosing negative elements. The result was the Planar Series Ia of 1896, with maximum apertures up to f/3.5, one of the fastest lenses of its time. Whilst it was very sharp, it suffered from coma which limited its popularity. However, further developments of this configuration made it the design of choice for high-speed lenses of standard coverage.\nProbably inspired by the Stigmatic lenses designed by Hugh Aldis for Dallmeyer of London, Rudolph designed a new asymmetrical lens with four thin elements, the Unar Series Ib, with apertures up to f/4.5. Due to its high speed, it was used extensively on hand cameras.\nThe most important Zeiss lens by Rudolph was the Tessar, first sold in 1902 in its Series IIb f/6.3 form. It can be said as a combination of the front half of the Unar with the rear half of the Protar. This proved to be the most valuable and flexible design, with tremendous development potential. Its maximum aperture was increased to f/4.7 in 1917 and reached f/2.7 in 1930. It is probable that every lens manufacturer has produced lenses of the Tessar configurations.\nRudolph left Zeiss after World War I, but many other competent designers such as Mert\u00e9, Wandersleb, etc. kept the firm at the leading edge of photographic lens innovations. One of the most significant designers was the ex-Ernemann man Dr Ludwig Bertele, famed for his Ernostar high-speed lens.\nWith the advent of the Contax by Zeiss-Ikon, the first professional 35mm system camera became available. At this stage the Leica was no more than a convenient and portable snapshot camera. However Leitz could see the potential offered by the Contax and rapidly developed a coupled rangefinder and started to introduce additional lenses. As a system camera there was a need for a range of lenses for the Contax. Bertele's Sonnar series of lenses designed for the Contax was the match in every respect for the Leica for at least two decades. Other lenses for the Contax included the Biotar, Biogon, Orthometar, and various Tessars and Triotars.\nThe last important Zeiss innovation before World War II was the technique of applying an anti-reflective coating to lens surfaces invented by Olexander Smakula in 1935. A lens so treated was marked with a red \"T\", short for \"Transparent\". The technique of applying multiple layers of coatings was developed from this basis after the war, and known as \"T\u273b\" (T-star).\n\nAfter the partitioning of Germany, a new Carl Zeiss optical company was established in Oberkochen, while the original Zeiss firm in Jena continued to operate. At first, both firms produced very similar lines of products, and extensively cooperated in product-sharing, but they drifted apart as time progressed. Jena's new direction was to concentrate on developing lenses for 35 mm single-lens reflex cameras, and many achievements were made, especially in ultra-wide angle designs. In addition to that, Oberkochen also worked on designing lenses for the 35 mm single-lens reflex camera Contarex, for the medium format camera Hasselblad, for large format cameras like the Linhof Technika, interchangeable front element lenses such as for the 35 mm single-lens reflex Contaflex and other types of cameras.\nSince the beginning of Zeiss as a photographic lens manufacturer, it has had a licensing programme, allowing other manufacturers to produce its lenses. Over the years its licensees included Voigtl\u00e4nder, Bausch & Lomb, Ross, Koristka, Krauss, Kodak. etc. In the 1970s, the western operation of Zeiss-Ikon collaborated with Yashica to produce the new Contax cameras, and many of the Zeiss lenses for this camera, among others, were produced by Yashica's optical arm, Tomioka. As Yashica's owner Kyocera ended camera production in 2006, and Yashica lenses were then made by Cosina, who also manufactured most of the new Zeiss designs for the new Zeiss Ikon coupled rangefinder camera. Another licensee active today is Sony who uses the Zeiss name on lenses on its video and digital still cameras.\n\n\n== Business relationships ==\nZeiss has licensed its name and/or technology to various other companies, including Hasselblad, Rollei, Yashica, Sony, Logitech, and Alpa. The nature of the collaboration varies, from co-branding optics designed by another firm (e.g., Sony) to complete optical design and manufacturing (e.g., Hasselblad).\nOn 27 April 2005, the company announced a collaboration with Nokia in the camera phone market, with Zeiss providing camera optics. Zeiss will again provide optics for Nokia products through a collaboration with HMD Global announced on 6 July 2017.\n\n\n== Zeiss cameras ==\n\n\n=== Zeiss ZX digital cameras ===\nThe Zeiss ZX1 full-frame 35mm F/2 large-sensor compact camera was announced during Photokina 2018 with the slogan 'Shoot \u2013 Edit \u2013 Share'. The camera incorporates Adobe editing capacities, and an internal 512GB SSD affording 6,800 DNG-format RAW images or 50,000 JPEG-format compressed images.\n\n\n=== Zeiss Ikon film cameras ===\nZeiss Ikon is a camera brand related to Carl Zeiss, but was an independent company formed by the merger of four camera makers (Contessa-Nettel, Ernemann, Goerz and Ica) in 1926. Much of the capital came from Zeiss which also provided most of the lenses and shutters for the cameras. Among the founders was August Nagel of Contessa-Nettel, who left the company in 1928 to form the Nagel Works, and in 1932, his company was bought by Kodak. After World War II, Japanese Nippon Kogaku offered the \"Nikon\" camera, and Zeiss Ikon prevented some European distribution under the theory that \"Nikon\" was an infringement on their brand name.\nThe earliest Zeiss Ikon cameras were a range of medium and large format folding cameras, for film and glass plate photography. The most expensive was the Universal Juwel (Jewel) an Ica-designed glass plate camera with origins in 1909. This was a favorite of both Ansel Adams and Dorothea Lange. Despite German production, the folding Super Ikonta was among the mainstays of British Army photographers during World War II.\nIn 1932 Zeiss Ikon introduced the Contax line of 35mm rangefinder cameras having recognised the potential for a system camera using 35mm film. The Contax I was introduced with a wide range of lenses and accessories for scientific and professional use. In 1936, an improved model the Contax II was introduced and became the favorite of many renowned photographers and journalists, including Robert Capa and Margaret Bourke-White. A second 35mm camera, the Contax III, was mechanically identical with a light meter grafted to the top of the camera.\nAfter World War II, the Soviets removed the Contax factory to Kiev, as war reparations, and produced the Contax II and III cameras under the Kiev brand. The first Kiev cameras were identical except for logos. Zeiss Ikon were without designs or facilities for making the Contax and set about producing an improved replacement. These were named the Contax IIa and IIIa, and were smaller and lighter than the original designs. But by the time the IIa and IIIa hit the market, they faced strong competition from many European and Asian brands, notably the visually similar Nikon which was a high quality camera sharing the same lens-mount and most of the features.\nBy the mid-1950s, Zeiss Ikon was focusing on single-lens reflex cameras and while offering rangefinders, they were not adding features and became uncompetitive with Japanese brands including Canon, Yashica, Minolta, and Nikon. The Zeiss Ikon Contaflex single-lens reflex cameras were viable in the mid 1950s, but soon lost market share to the Japanese brands.\nMore recent 35mm rangefinder cameras are simply named \"Zeiss Ikon.\" The most recent \"Zeiss Ikon\" rangefinder camera was an M mount camera with automatic exposure, introduced by Zeiss in 2004, manufactured in Japan by Cosina, and now discontinued.\n\n\n== Camera lenses ==\n\n\n=== Cinema lenses ===\nCarl Zeiss AG has long been renowned for its motion picture lenses. Zeiss manufactures prime and zoom lenses for 35mm, 16mm, and 65mm film production. They also make lenses for digital cinema and high definition video. Zeiss is mainly known in the trade for their association with the German camera manufacturer Arri for whom they currently produce lenses.\nCurrent models of Zeiss cinema lenses are:\n\n\n=== Medium-format lenses ===\nCarl Zeiss AG has produced lenses for Hasselblad and Rollei cameras, including:\n\n\n=== Large-format lenses ===\nZeiss has produced lenses for large format and press cameras, including:\n\nZeiss has departed the large-format optics field along with Nikon, leaving Schneider and Rodenstock as the primary makers of such lenses today.\n\n\n=== ZM lenses ===\nZeiss ZM lenses fit Leica M mount cameras, including Leica M series, the Ricoh GXR A12, and many mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras through the use of adapters. Some ZM lenses are manufactured in Germany by Zeiss, others in Japan by Cosina. Lenses designated \"C\" are considered compact or classic lenses.\n\nZeiss claims that the 25mm \u0192/2.8 ZM achieves a resolution of 400 lp/mm in the center of the image at \u0192/4, which is equal to the calculated diffraction limit for this aperture.\n\n\n=== Z-series SLR lenses ===\nZeiss produces optically identical manual-focus lenses for multiple SLR lens mounts under the ZE, ZF, ZK, and ZS lines, manufactured in Japan by Cosina to Zeiss specifications.\n\nZF series lenses fit the Nikon F-mount. Four design variations are designated ZF, ZF.2, ZF-I, and ZF-IR. All are manual-focus designs with Nikon AI-S type aperture indexing.\n\nZF lenses have AI-S aperture indexing, half-stop aperture ring detents, and no electronic features.\nZF.2 lenses are like ZF lenses, with the addition CPU functionality, similar to Nikon AI-P lenses. They allow electronic focus confirmation, full metering compatibility, and electronic aperture control with Nikon SLR cameras which require CPU lenses.\nZF-I lenses feature mechanical locks for focus and aperture, and additional environmental sealing, for industrial applications.\nZF-IR lenses are adapted to infrared imaging, with coatings that transmit wavelengths up to 1100 nm, and focus scales marked for infrared.ZE lenses fit the Canon EF lens mount. They feature electronic contacts allowing for focus-confirmation, and electric aperture operation as with standard Canon EF lenses.ZK lenses fit the Pentax K-mount. They have no electronics, are manual focus only, KA couplers. Zeiss announced the discontinuation of the ZK line in September 2010.\nZS lenses fit the M42 lens mount (Pentacon/Practica/Pentax screw mount). By use of mount adapters they can be adapted to most 35 mm bayonet camera mounts including Canon FD and EF, Pentax K, Minolta SR and Sony/Konica Minolta/Minolta A mounts (with the exception of Nikon F mount), usually losing open-aperture-metering, multi-segment metering, focus confirmation, automatic flash zoom capabilities as well as some built-in shake reduction performance and Exif data accuracy.\n\n\n=== Otus lenses ===\n\nZeiss produces manual focus Otus lenses for the Nikon F-mount and Canon EF mount, with electronic features equivalent to Zeiss ZF.2 and ZE lenses respectively. Otus lenses are complex no-compromise designs which Zeiss refers to as the \"best in the world\" in the normal lens and short telephoto categories. They cover the 35 mm format.\n\nOtus APO-Distagon T\u273b 28mm \u0192/1.4\nOtus APO-Distagon T\u273b 55mm \u0192/1.4\nOtus APO-Planar T\u273b 85mm \u0192/1.4\n\n\n=== Batis lenses ===\n\nZeiss produces autofocus Batis lenses for the Sony E-mount.

Like Sony \"FE\" lenses, they cover the 35mm format. The 35/2 and 50/2 are carried over from the existing ZM line.\n\nLoxia Distagon T\u273b 21mm f/2.8\nLoxia Biogon T\u273b 35mm f/2.0\nLoxia Planar T\u273b 50mm f/2.0\nLoxia Sonnar T\u273b 85mm f/2.4\n\n\n=== Touit lenses ===\nZeiss produces autofocus Touit lenses for the Fujifilm X-mount and Sony E-mount. They cover the APS-C format.\n\nTouit Distagon T\u273b 12mm f/2.8\nTouit Planar T\u273b 32mm f/1.8\nTouit Makro Planar T\u273b 50mm f/2.8 Macro\n\n\n=== Milvus lenses ===\n\nZeiss produces manual focus Milvus lenses for the Nikon F-mount (ZF.2) and Canon EF lens mount (ZE), covering the 35mm format. The 15/2.8, 21/2.8, 35/2, 50/2, 100/2, and 135/2 are carried over from the previous Z-series (now referred to as Zeiss Classic).\n\nMilvus Distagon T\u273b 15mm \u0192/2.8\nMilvus Distagon T\u273b 18mm \u0192/2.8\nMilvus Distagon T\u273b 21mm \u0192/2.8\nMilvus Distagon T\u273b 25mm \u0192/1.4\nMilvus Distagon T\u273b 35mm \u0192/1.4\nMilvus Distagon T\u273b 35mm \u0192/2\nMilvus Distagon T\u273b 50mm \u0192/1.4\nMilvus Makro-Planar T\u273b 50mm \u0192/2\nMilvus Planar T\u273b 85mm \u0192/1.4\nMilvus Makro-Planar T\u273b 100mm \u0192/2\nMilvus APO-Sonnar T\u273b 135mm \u0192/2\n\n\n=== Super-rotator lenses ===\nThese are 360\u00b0 tilt/shift lenses (based on Zeiss medium format lens designs) for 35 mm format including full-frame digital. Available mounts: Canon EF, Nikon F, Sony Alpha/Konica Minolta/Minolta A mount. Other mounts on request. Manual focus only, no electronics. Manufactured in Germany and Ukraine.\n\nHartblei Superrotator Carl Zeiss Distagon T\u273b IF 1:4.0 40 mm\nHartblei Superrotator Carl Zeiss Planar T\u273b 1:2.8 80 mm\nHartblei Superrotator Carl Zeiss Makro-Planar T\u273b 1:4.0 120 mm\n\n\n=== NASA ===\nZeiss is currently in the process of designing the optical components for the James Webb Space Telescope set to replace the Hubble Space Telescope sometime in 2021.A unique triplet of ultra-fast 50 mm f/0.7 lenses originally created by Zeiss for NASA's lunar program had the distinction of being reused by Stanley Kubrick in the filming of his historical drama Barry Lyndon. The period atmosphere of the film demanded that several indoor scenes be filmed by candlelight. To facilitate this, Kubrick had the lenses modified to mount onto a cinema camera and two of them subsequently further modified in separate ways to give wider angles of view.\n\n\n=== Smartphone lenses ===\nZeiss worked with Nokia, and later with Microsoft Mobile as they continued production of the Lumia series. The Nokia 808 PureView features a lens custom-developed by Zeiss for its 1/1.2 inch sensor; as did its successor, the Nokia Lumia 1020. The Nokia N90 and Nokia N8 also used Zeiss optics. In 2017, Zeiss again provided optics for Nokia products through a collaboration with HMD Global, beginning with the Nokia 8.\n\n\n=== ZA lenses ===\nZA (\"Zeiss Alpha\") lenses are designed and manufactured by Sony in Japan, and co-branded with the Zeiss name. Sony and Zeiss collaboratively set design and quality parameters for ZA lenses.\n\nA-mount ZA-lenses fit the Sony Alpha/Konica Minolta/Minolta A-mount system. They are fully dedicated autofocus lenses with eight electrical contacts, ROM-IC, and distance encoder (\"(D)-function\" to support ADI flash). All except for the DT lens are full-frame lenses.\nSony \u03b1 Carl Zeiss Distagon T\u273b 1:2 24 mm ZA SSM (SAL-24F20Z)\nSony \u03b1 Carl Zeiss Planar T\u273b 1:1.4 50 mm ZA SSM (SAL-50F14Z)\nSony \u03b1 Carl Zeiss Planar T\u273b 1:1.4 85 mm ZA (SAL-85F14Z)\nSony \u03b1 Carl Zeiss Sonnar T\u273b 1:1.8 135 mm ZA (SAL-135F18Z)\nSony \u03b1 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T\u273b 1:2.8 16\u201335 mm ZA SSM (SAL-1635Z)\nSony \u03b1 Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T\u273b 1:2.8 16\u201335 mm ZA SSM II (SAL-1635Z2)\nSony \u03b1 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T\u273b DT 1:3.5\u20131:4.5 16\u201380 mm ZA (SAL-1680Z)\nSony \u03b1 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T\u273b 1:2.8 24\u201370 mm ZA SSM (SAL-2470Z)\nSony \u03b1 Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T\u273b 1:2.8 24\u201370 mm ZA SSM II (SAL-2470Z2)\nE-mount ZA-lenses are fully dedicated Sony E-mount autofocus lenses.

These include camera and cine lenses, microscopes and microscopy software, binoculars and spotting scopes, eyeglasses and lenses, planetariums and dome video-systems, optical sensors, industrial metrology systems and ophthalmology products. Even video glasses belong to the product range. In the summer of 2012, the new video glasses Cinemizer OLED were to come on the market. In addition to the viewing of 2D and 3D movies, it will be possible to play computer games when fitted with the equipment.The largest part of Carl Zeiss AG's revenue is generated by its Semiconductor Manufacturing Technologies division, which produces lithographic systems for the semiconductor industry, as well as process control solutions (electron microscopes, mask repair tools, helium ion microscopes).\n\n\n=== Sports Optics ===\nCarl Zeiss Sports Optics division produces rifle telescopic sights, spotting scopes, binoculars, and distance measuring devices for outdoors enthusiasts. The three main product lines are the Conquest line, which is manufactured in Germany and assembled in the United States, and Victory line, which is produced entirely in Germany, and the Terra line, which is made in Asia.\nSince 2019 the following Zeiss sport optics products series are in production:\n\n\n=== Binoculars ===\nTerra\nConquest HD\nVictory HT\nVictory SF\nVictory RF range finding binoculars\n20x60 T* S\n\n\n=== Spotting scopes ===\nDialyt\nConquest Gavia\nVictory Harpia\n\n\n=== Rifle scopes ===\nConquest V4\nConquest V6\nVictory HT\nVictory V8\n\n\n=== Medical Solutions ===\nThis branch of Carl Zeiss is managed by Carl Zeiss Meditec. It is divided in Ophthalmology/Optometry, Neurosurgery, ENT, Spine, P&R, Dentistry, Radiotherapy and Gynecology.\n\n\n=== Vision Care ===\nCarl Zeiss Vision Care division develops, manufactures and distributes ophthalmic lenses, optical coatings, and dispensary technologies and services. Zeiss is known for ophthalmic lenses made from high refractive index glass, allowing stronger prescription lenses to be thinner.\nTheir progressive lens ZEISS Progressive Individual has won multiple awards including the OLA awards in 2009 presented at Washington, D.C. and the VisionPlus or VP Awards in 2014 at Mumbai, India.\n\n\n=== Industrial metrology ===\nZeiss Industrial Metrology specializes in high-accuracy measurement systems, including coordinate-measuring machines (CMMs), computed tomography measurement machines (non-medical), optical measuring equipment, metrology software and measurement sensor systems. The Industrial Metrology subsidiary provides this equipment to a wide range of manufacturing facilities worldwide.Zeiss has manufactured coordinate measuring machines since 1919, offering very basic manually operated CMMs. In 1973, Zeiss introduced the UMM 500, using a Zeiss sensor system and Hewlett-Packard computer. Zeiss has since vastly improved and diversified their product line and now feature many high accuracy CMMs, the Metrotom, a CT x-ray scanning measuring machine, with the ability to quickly and completely measure a part in 3 dimensions without ever touching the part, and the O-INSPECT, a fully optical measurement machine.\nZeiss is currently a member of the International Association of CMM Manufacturers (IACMM).Many of the sensor systems produced by Zeiss are proprietary technologies, using technologies exclusively patented by Zeiss, and therefore can offer better accuracy and repeatability than its competitors.Zeiss was the first manufacturer of coordinate measurement machines to introduce computer numerical control (CNC) technology to a coordinate measurement machine and was the first company to offer CNC stylus changer capability for these machines.\n\n\n=== Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology ===\nCarl Zeiss SMT systems for DUV and EUV electromagnetic radiation are used in chip-lithography machines for focusing the extremely short wavelengths.. Together with the company ASML and its subsidies and partners Zeiss is the sole supplier of the lithography systems that are able to manufacture core layers of the latest semiconductor chips.\n\n\n=== Microscopes ===\nZeiss offers different types of microscopes:\n\nOptical microscopes\nLaser scanning microscopes (LSMs)\nScanning electron microscopes (SEMs)\nScanning helium ion microscopes (SHIMs)\n\n\n=== Fire doors ===\nThe name Zeiss Ikon can also be found in old cinemas, on fire shutters on the projection windows. These had heat fuses that melted and dropped the shutter over the hole if the film caught fire in the projection booth.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTelescopic sight\nWalther Bauersfeld\nZeiss projector\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nZeiss Company Timeline starting 1973\nCarl Zeiss Company Timeline starting 1909\nCarl Zeiss Company History, an older article but updated and covering Zeiss history up to about 2000, with interesting content and illustrations",

        "wiki": "Stuttgart ( SHTUUT-gart, also US:  STU(U)T-, STOOT-, SHTOOT-; German: [\u02c8\u0283t\u028at\u0261a\u0281t] (listen); Swabian: Schduagert [\u02c8\u0292\u030ad\u0325ua\u032f\u0261\u030a\u025b\u0295d\u0325]; names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:\n\nThe Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534.

In neighboring Leinfelden-Echterdingen\n\n\n=== Parks, lakes, cemeteries and other places of interest ===\n \nAt the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists. Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.\nOther parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandsh\u00f6he hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Wei\u00dfenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at 511 metres (1,677 ft) the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300\u2013400 years old).\n\nThere are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium. Established in 1873 it was extended to include Jewish graves in 1874 and also now houses the Russian Orthodox Church of Alexander Nevsky\nThe Uff-Kirchhof cemetery in Bad Cannstatt which stands at the crossroads of two ancient Roman roads and Cannstatter Hauptfriedhof, the largest graveyard in Stuttgart which has been used as a Muslim burial ground since 1985.The city boasts the largest mineral water deposits in Europe after Budapest, with over 250 springs within the urban area.\n\n\n=== Culture and events ===\n\nStuttgart is known for its rich cultural heritage, in particular its State Theatre (Staatstheater) and State Gallery (Staatsgalerie). The Staatstheater is home to the State opera and three smaller theatres. It regularly stages opera, ballet and theatre productions as well as concerts. The Staatstheater was named Germany/Austria/Switzerland \"Theatre of the year\" in 2006; the Stuttgart Opera has won the 'Opera of the year' award six times. Stuttgart Ballet is connected to names like John Cranko and Marcia Hayd\u00e9e.\nStuttgart is also home to one of Germany's most prestigious symphony orchestras, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra, with famous English conductor Sir Roger Norrington, who developed a distinct sound of that orchestra, known as the Stuttgart Sound. They mostly perform in the Liederhalle concert hall.\nThe city offers two Broadway-style musical theaters, the Apollo and the Palladium Theater (each approx. 1800 seats). Ludwigsburg Palace in the nearby town of Ludwigsburg is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.\nAs a result of Stuttgart's long history of viticulture (Even today there are vineyards less than 500 m (1,640 ft) from the Main Station), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the \"St\u00e4ffele\") around the city, equivalent to approximately 20 km (12 mi) of steps. Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond. For example, Gaisburger Marsch is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart's Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.\n\nIn October 2009 the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced that the European Union was to officially recognise the pasta dish Maultaschen as a \"regional specialty\", thus marking its significance to the cultural heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.In 1993 Stuttgart hosted the International Garden Show in the suburb of Killesberg. In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the Football World Cup. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. In 2008 it was host to the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships. In 2015 Stuttgart hosted the Protestant Kirchentag (Chuchfestival)\nRegular events that take place in Stuttgart:\n\nThe world-famous annual 'Volksfest', originally a traditional agricultural fair which now also hosts beer tents and a French village and is second in size only to the Oktoberfest in Munich. There is also a Spring festival on the same grounds in April of each year.\nWith more than 3.6 million visitors in 2007 and more than 200 stands, Stuttgart's Christmas Market, running from late November to 23 December, is the largest and one of the oldest traditional Christmas markets in Europe. It is especially renowned for its abundant decorations and takes place in the four weeks leading up to Christmas.\nThe Fish Market (Hamburger Fischmarkt, late July) with fresh fish, other food and beer from Hamburg.\nThe Summer Festival (Stuttgart Sommerfest, usually in early August) with shows, music, children's entertainment and local cuisine in Schlossplatz, Stuttgart and adjacent parks\nThe Lantern Festival (Lichterfest, early July) in Killesberg park with its famous firework display and fairground attractions\nThe Wine Village (Weindorf, late August/early September) \u2013 vintages are sold at this event held at Schillerplatz and Marktplatz (Market Square)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nStuttgart is home to five of the eleven state museums in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The foremost of these is the Old State Gallery (opened in 1843, extended in 1984) which holds art dating from the 14th to 19th century including works by Rubens, Rembrandt, Monet, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne and Beuys. Next door to the Old State Gallery is the New State Gallery (1980) with its controversial modern architecture. Among others, this gallery houses works from Max Beckmann, Dal\u00ed, Matisse, Mir\u00f3, Picasso, Klee, Chagall and Kandinsky.\nThe Old Castle is also home to the State Museum of W\u00fcrttemberg which was founded in 1862 by William I of W\u00fcrttemberg. The museum traces the rich history of W\u00fcrttemberg with many artifacts from its dukes, counts and kings, as well as earlier remnants dating back to the Stone Age. On the Karlsplatz side of the Old Castle is a museum dedicated to the memory of Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, former resident of Stuttgart who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944.\n\nOther leading museums in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe History Museum (Haus der Geschichte, 1987), examining local history, finds, the conflict between modern society and its cultural history\nState Museum of Natural History Stuttgart (SMNS) in Park Rosenstein housed in Castle Rosenstein (with an emphasis on biology and natural history) and L\u00f6wentor Museum (paleontology and geology, home of the Steinheim skull and many unique fossils from the triassic, jurassic and tertiary periods)\nThe Mercedes-Benz Museum (1936, moved in 2006), now the most visited museum in Stuttgart (440,000 visits per year).

The Stuttgart-based Pentecostal Gospel Forum is the largest place of worship (megachurch) in Germany. It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy W\u00fcrttemberg until 1806, the W\u00fcrttemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen W\u00fcrttemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart. The archived material is in principle open to the public and can be consulted in the reading room in Bellingweg 21 in Bad Cannstatt.\nThe Landeskirchliche Archives preserve the stocks of the W\u00fcrttemberg church leaders and of other ecclesial bodies and institutions: the ducal and royal W\u00fcrttemberg consistory, the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, deanery and parish archives, educational institutions, the works and associations as well as estates and collections. It also has the microfilms of all church books (especially baptism, marriage, and family Death's Register) in the area of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe \"Archive instigator\" is dedicated to the dead of the city. Since 2005, the instigators are working on a memoir about \"The dead town\". So far, about 5,000 names of victims of the regime of National Socialism have been acquired.\nThere are two large tours that are available to visitors to Stuttgart. The first is the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (also called the CityTour Stuttgart), lasting from 10 AM to 4 PM that takes visitors around the city. The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Some of its most prominent companies include Daimler AG, Porsche, Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sika \u2013 all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.\nStuttgart is home to Germany's ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nThe city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg after Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and Freiburg.

Its campus for social sciences and architecture is located in the city centre, near the main train station, while the natural science campus is in the southwestern city district of Vaihingen. Historically, it has been especially renowned for its faculty of architecture (Stuttgarter Schule). Today, its main focus is on engineering and other technical subjects.\nUniversity of Hohenheim, founded in 1818 as an academy for agricultural science and forestry.

This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (Umweltzone), including vehicles from abroad.\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\n\nStuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn.

The Stuttgart 21 project will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart's enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and should be completed in 2020.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Stuttgart Airport (German: Flughafen Stuttgart, IATA airport code STR), an international airport approximately 13 km (8 mi) south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns.

Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:\n\nThe Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534. Exterior: Romanesque/Gothic; interior: Romanesque/Gothic/Modern. Reconstructed with simplified interior after World War II.\nAltes Schloss (the Old Castle), mostly dating from the late 15th century, some parts date back to 1320. Renaissance style; reconstructed\nAlte Kanzlei (the Old Chancellery) on Schillerplatz square which backs onto the 1598 Mercury Pillar\nNeues Schloss (the New Castle), completed in 1807. Baroque/Classicism); reconstructed with modern interior, currently houses government offices. The cellars with a collection of stone fragments from the Roman times are open to visitors\nWilhelmpalais (the King Wilhelm Palais), 1840\nK\u00f6nigsbau (the King's Building), 1850. Classicism; reconstructed; has been housing the \"K\u00f6nigsbau Passagen\" shopping centre since 2006.\nThe Gro\u00dfes Haus of Stuttgart National Theatre, 1909\u20131912\nMarkthalle Market Hall, 1910.

Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.\nOther parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandsh\u00f6he hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Wei\u00dfenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at 511 metres (1,677 ft) the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300\u2013400 years old).\n\nThere are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium.

Ludwigsburg Palace in the nearby town of Ludwigsburg is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.\nAs a result of Stuttgart's long history of viticulture (Even today there are vineyards less than 500 m (1,640 ft) from the Main Station), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the \"St\u00e4ffele\") around the city, equivalent to approximately 20 km (12 mi) of steps. Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond. For example, Gaisburger Marsch is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart's Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.\n\nIn October 2009 the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced that the European Union was to officially recognise the pasta dish Maultaschen as a \"regional specialty\", thus marking its significance to the cultural heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.In 1993 Stuttgart hosted the International Garden Show in the suburb of Killesberg. In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the Football World Cup. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.

The Stuttgart-based Pentecostal Gospel Forum is the largest place of worship (megachurch) in Germany. It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy W\u00fcrttemberg until 1806, the W\u00fcrttemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen W\u00fcrttemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart. The archived material is in principle open to the public and can be consulted in the reading room in Bellingweg 21 in Bad Cannstatt.\nThe Landeskirchliche Archives preserve the stocks of the W\u00fcrttemberg church leaders and of other ecclesial bodies and institutions: the ducal and royal W\u00fcrttemberg consistory, the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, deanery and parish archives, educational institutions, the works and associations as well as estates and collections.

Since 2005, the instigators are working on a memoir about \"The dead town\". So far, about 5,000 names of victims of the regime of National Socialism have been acquired.\nThere are two large tours that are available to visitors to Stuttgart. The first is the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (also called the CityTour Stuttgart), lasting from 10 AM to 4 PM that takes visitors around the city. The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Some of its most prominent companies include Daimler AG, Porsche, Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sika \u2013 all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.\nStuttgart is home to Germany's ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nThe city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg after Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and Freiburg. Founded in 1829, it was a Technische Hochschule (\"Technical University\") until 1967, when it was renamed to \"university\". Its campus for social sciences and architecture is located in the city centre, near the main train station, while the natural science campus is in the southwestern city district of Vaihingen. Historically, it has been especially renowned for its faculty of architecture (Stuttgarter Schule). Today, its main focus is on engineering and other technical subjects.\nUniversity of Hohenheim, founded in 1818 as an academy for agricultural science and forestry. While these subjects are still taught there today, its other focus today is on business administration.

Friedrich Schiller and the city's most famous Classicist architect, Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, were among its many esteemed alumni.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nThe first Waldorf School (also known as Rudolf Steiner School) was founded here in 1919 by the director of the Waldorf Astoria tobacco factory, Emil Molt, and Austrian social thinker Rudolf Steiner, a comprehensive school following Steiner's educational principles of anthroposophy and humanistic ideals. Today, four of these schools are located in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== International School ===\nSince 1985 Stuttgart is home to the International School of Stuttgart, one of fewer than 100 schools worldwide that offer all three International Baccalaureate programs- the IB Primary Years (Early Learning to Grade 5), IB Middle Years (Grade 6 to 10), IB Diploma (grades 11\u201312). The International School of Stuttgart is accredited by both the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.\n\n\n== Media and publishing ==\nOne of the headquarters of the public S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR; Southwest Broadcasting) channels (several radio and one TV channel; regional focus on the southwestern German States of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate) is located in Stuttgart (the other ones being Baden-Baden and Mainz).

It transmits on FM on 102.3 MHz from Fernmeldeturm Frauenkopf and on AM on 1143 kHz from Hirschlanden transmitter.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFollowing the suit of other German cities such as Berlin, Cologne and Hanover, on 1 March 2008 a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) came into effect in Stuttgart with the aim of improving air quality. This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (Umweltzone), including vehicles from abroad.\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\n\nStuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a 'U' symbol, which stands for Untergrundbahn (underground rail). Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfenbahnen AG (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the Stuttgart S-Bahn, using tracks supplied by the national Deutsche Bahn AG (DB).\nA peculiarity of Stuttgart is the Zahnradbahn, a rack railway that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch. It is the only urban rack railway in Germany. Stuttgart also has a Standseilbahn, a funicular railway that operates in the Heslach area and the forest cemetery (Waldfriedhof). In Killesberg Park, on a prominent hill overlooking the city, there is the miniature railway run by diesel (and on weekends with steam).\n\n\n=== Rail links ===\n\nStuttgart is a hub in the Intercity-Express and Intercity networks of Deutsche Bahn AG (DB), with through services to most other major German cities. It also operates international services to Strasbourg, Vienna, Z\u00fcrich and Paris (five times a day, journey time 3 hours 11 minutes).Long-distance trains stop at Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, the city's main line terminus, which is also used by Interregio-Express, Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains for services to stations in the Stuttgart metropolitan area.

Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:\n\nThe Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534.

In neighboring Leinfelden-Echterdingen\n\n\n=== Parks, lakes, cemeteries and other places of interest ===\n \nAt the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists. Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.\nOther parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandsh\u00f6he hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Wei\u00dfenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at 511 metres (1,677 ft) the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300\u2013400 years old).\n\nThere are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium. Established in 1873 it was extended to include Jewish graves in 1874 and also now houses the Russian Orthodox Church of Alexander Nevsky\nThe Uff-Kirchhof cemetery in Bad Cannstatt which stands at the crossroads of two ancient Roman roads and Cannstatter Hauptfriedhof, the largest graveyard in Stuttgart which has been used as a Muslim burial ground since 1985.The city boasts the largest mineral water deposits in Europe after Budapest, with over 250 springs within the urban area.\n\n\n=== Culture and events ===\n\nStuttgart is known for its rich cultural heritage, in particular its State Theatre (Staatstheater) and State Gallery (Staatsgalerie). The Staatstheater is home to the State opera and three smaller theatres. It regularly stages opera, ballet and theatre productions as well as concerts. The Staatstheater was named Germany/Austria/Switzerland \"Theatre of the year\" in 2006; the Stuttgart Opera has won the 'Opera of the year' award six times. Stuttgart Ballet is connected to names like John Cranko and Marcia Hayd\u00e9e.\nStuttgart is also home to one of Germany's most prestigious symphony orchestras, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra, with famous English conductor Sir Roger Norrington, who developed a distinct sound of that orchestra, known as the Stuttgart Sound. They mostly perform in the Liederhalle concert hall.\nThe city offers two Broadway-style musical theaters, the Apollo and the Palladium Theater (each approx. 1800 seats). Ludwigsburg Palace in the nearby town of Ludwigsburg is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.\nAs a result of Stuttgart's long history of viticulture (Even today there are vineyards less than 500 m (1,640 ft) from the Main Station), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the \"St\u00e4ffele\") around the city, equivalent to approximately 20 km (12 mi) of steps. Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond. For example, Gaisburger Marsch is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart's Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.\n\nIn October 2009 the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced that the European Union was to officially recognise the pasta dish Maultaschen as a \"regional specialty\", thus marking its significance to the cultural heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.In 1993 Stuttgart hosted the International Garden Show in the suburb of Killesberg. In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the Football World Cup. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. In 2008 it was host to the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships. In 2015 Stuttgart hosted the Protestant Kirchentag (Chuchfestival)\nRegular events that take place in Stuttgart:\n\nThe world-famous annual 'Volksfest', originally a traditional agricultural fair which now also hosts beer tents and a French village and is second in size only to the Oktoberfest in Munich. There is also a Spring festival on the same grounds in April of each year.\nWith more than 3.6 million visitors in 2007 and more than 200 stands, Stuttgart's Christmas Market, running from late November to 23 December, is the largest and one of the oldest traditional Christmas markets in Europe. It is especially renowned for its abundant decorations and takes place in the four weeks leading up to Christmas.\nThe Fish Market (Hamburger Fischmarkt, late July) with fresh fish, other food and beer from Hamburg.\nThe Summer Festival (Stuttgart Sommerfest, usually in early August) with shows, music, children's entertainment and local cuisine in Schlossplatz, Stuttgart and adjacent parks\nThe Lantern Festival (Lichterfest, early July) in Killesberg park with its famous firework display and fairground attractions\nThe Wine Village (Weindorf, late August/early September) \u2013 vintages are sold at this event held at Schillerplatz and Marktplatz (Market Square)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nStuttgart is home to five of the eleven state museums in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The foremost of these is the Old State Gallery (opened in 1843, extended in 1984) which holds art dating from the 14th to 19th century including works by Rubens, Rembrandt, Monet, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne and Beuys. Next door to the Old State Gallery is the New State Gallery (1980) with its controversial modern architecture. Among others, this gallery houses works from Max Beckmann, Dal\u00ed, Matisse, Mir\u00f3, Picasso, Klee, Chagall and Kandinsky.\nThe Old Castle is also home to the State Museum of W\u00fcrttemberg which was founded in 1862 by William I of W\u00fcrttemberg. The museum traces the rich history of W\u00fcrttemberg with many artifacts from its dukes, counts and kings, as well as earlier remnants dating back to the Stone Age. On the Karlsplatz side of the Old Castle is a museum dedicated to the memory of Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, former resident of Stuttgart who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944.\n\nOther leading museums in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe History Museum (Haus der Geschichte, 1987), examining local history, finds, the conflict between modern society and its cultural history\nState Museum of Natural History Stuttgart (SMNS) in Park Rosenstein housed in Castle Rosenstein (with an emphasis on biology and natural history) and L\u00f6wentor Museum (paleontology and geology, home of the Steinheim skull and many unique fossils from the triassic, jurassic and tertiary periods)\nThe Mercedes-Benz Museum (1936, moved in 2006), now the most visited museum in Stuttgart (440,000 visits per year).

The Stuttgart-based Pentecostal Gospel Forum is the largest place of worship (megachurch) in Germany. It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy W\u00fcrttemberg until 1806, the W\u00fcrttemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen W\u00fcrttemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart. The archived material is in principle open to the public and can be consulted in the reading room in Bellingweg 21 in Bad Cannstatt.\nThe Landeskirchliche Archives preserve the stocks of the W\u00fcrttemberg church leaders and of other ecclesial bodies and institutions: the ducal and royal W\u00fcrttemberg consistory, the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, deanery and parish archives, educational institutions, the works and associations as well as estates and collections. It also has the microfilms of all church books (especially baptism, marriage, and family Death's Register) in the area of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe \"Archive instigator\" is dedicated to the dead of the city. Since 2005, the instigators are working on a memoir about \"The dead town\". So far, about 5,000 names of victims of the regime of National Socialism have been acquired.\nThere are two large tours that are available to visitors to Stuttgart. The first is the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (also called the CityTour Stuttgart), lasting from 10 AM to 4 PM that takes visitors around the city. The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Some of its most prominent companies include Daimler AG, Porsche, Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sika \u2013 all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.\nStuttgart is home to Germany's ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nThe city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg after Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and Freiburg. Founded in 1829, it was a Technische Hochschule (\"Technical University\") until 1967, when it was renamed to \"university\". Its campus for social sciences and architecture is located in the city centre, near the main train station, while the natural science campus is in the southwestern city district of Vaihingen. Historically, it has been especially renowned for its faculty of architecture (Stuttgarter Schule). Today, its main focus is on engineering and other technical subjects.\nUniversity of Hohenheim, founded in 1818 as an academy for agricultural science and forestry. While these subjects are still taught there today, its other focus today is on business administration.

Friedrich Schiller and the city's most famous Classicist architect, Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, were among its many esteemed alumni.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nThe first Waldorf School (also known as Rudolf Steiner School) was founded here in 1919 by the director of the Waldorf Astoria tobacco factory, Emil Molt, and Austrian social thinker Rudolf Steiner, a comprehensive school following Steiner's educational principles of anthroposophy and humanistic ideals. Today, four of these schools are located in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== International School ===\nSince 1985 Stuttgart is home to the International School of Stuttgart, one of fewer than 100 schools worldwide that offer all three International Baccalaureate programs- the IB Primary Years (Early Learning to Grade 5), IB Middle Years (Grade 6 to 10), IB Diploma (grades 11\u201312). The International School of Stuttgart is accredited by both the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.\n\n\n== Media and publishing ==\nOne of the headquarters of the public S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR; Southwest Broadcasting) channels (several radio and one TV channel; regional focus on the southwestern German States of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate) is located in Stuttgart (the other ones being Baden-Baden and Mainz).

The Reclam Verlag is located in nearby Ditzingen.\nThe newspapers Stuttgarter Zeitung (StZ; regional, with significant supra-regional, national and international sections) and Stuttgarter Nachrichten (StN; regional) are published here as well as a number of smaller, local papers such as Cannstatter Zeitung.\nAs is the case wherever the US military is stationed, there is an American Forces Network (AFN) station. It transmits on FM on 102.3 MHz from Fernmeldeturm Frauenkopf and on AM on 1143 kHz from Hirschlanden transmitter.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFollowing the suit of other German cities such as Berlin, Cologne and Hanover, on 1 March 2008 a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) came into effect in Stuttgart with the aim of improving air quality. This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (Umweltzone), including vehicles from abroad.\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\n\nStuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a 'U' symbol, which stands for Untergrundbahn (underground rail). Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfenbahnen AG (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the Stuttgart S-Bahn, using tracks supplied by the national Deutsche Bahn AG (DB).\nA peculiarity of Stuttgart is the Zahnradbahn, a rack railway that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch.

The local rail networks (see above) operate underneath the terminus.Stuttgart also has its own rail freight centre with marshalling yards and a container terminal in the Obert\u00fcrkheim area of Hedelfingen.\n\n\n=== Rail: The Stuttgart 21 project ===\nAfter years of political debate and controversy, plans were approved in October 2007 to convert the existing above-ground main train station to an underground through station. The Stuttgart 21 project will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart's enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and should be completed in 2020.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Stuttgart Airport (German: Flughafen Stuttgart, IATA airport code STR), an international airport approximately 13 km (8 mi) south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns. It takes 30 minutes to reach the airport from the city center using S-Bahn lines S2 or S3. Stuttgart airport is Germany's only international airport with one runway.

        "wiki": "Stuttgart Cathedral or St Eberhard's Cathedral (Domkirche St. Eberhard, previously Stadtpfarrkirche St. Eberhard) is a church in the German city of Stuttgart. It is dedicated to Saint Eberhard of Salzburg. Since 1978, it has been co-cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, whose main cathedral is Rottenburg Cathedral - the church's promotion marked the 150th anniversary of the diocese and its renaming as the Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart. The parish dates back to the Medieval era while the current building was completed in 1955, eleven years after it was mostly destroyed by Allied air raids in 1944.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nLiudolf erected a small church around 950 and remnants of the old collegiate church (stiftskirche) were discovered under the nave of the current Cathedral. The fortunes of the Cathedral has largely been determined by the religion of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, who ruled the area which comprises the present-day state Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, of which Stuttgart is the capital. Catholicism was banned when the family converted to Protestantism.\nIn its early years, the church was administered by the friars of Altenburg Abbey. During the Reformation, Stuttgart became mainly Protestant and Catholic mass was banned from the city from 1535 until the Peace of Augsburg was signed in 1555. Stuttgart became Catholic again after the Holy Roman Empire and its allies triumphed over the Protestant forces in the Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen. The church came under the administration of the Jesuits, who notably desecrated the grave of theologian and Reformer Johannes Brenz. Catholic mass was once again banned with the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia. The Stiftskirche became a Protestant church and many restrictions were placed on the Catholic population. These restrictions began to be relaxed as the now Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg became secularised (see German mediatization), although Protestantism remained the dominant and de facto state religion. The government allowed for a designated priest to minister to the Catholic population; one such priest was Johann Baptist von Keller.\n\n\n=== The \"new\" church ===\nIn 1808, the foundation stone for the new Catholic church was laid with little fanfare. It was completed in 1811 and consecrated by Franz Karl Joseph F\u00fcrst von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf\u00fcrst, the Bishop of Augsburg. Eberhard was chosen to be the patron saint. Initially, Eberhard of Salzburg was chosen but later Eberhard of Nellenburg (de), founder of Kloster Allerheiligen, Schaffhausen, was the preferred choice. During Nazi rule, theologian Helmut Thielicke was based at Stuttgart and gave lectures and sermons at the cathedral. The rectory and most of the church, along with many important buildings in the city, were destroyed during the bombing of Stuttgart in World War II in 1944. In his book Man of God, Thielicke described the scene: \"I can still see the towering torch of this venerable house of God. [...] ...and I stood there holding in my hand a key to a door that no longer existed...\"\n\n\n=== Post-war era ===\nFrom 1948 to 1955, parishioners worshiped at a repaired section of the Kunstgeb\u00e4ude Stuttgart (English: Arts Building) (de) on the Schlossplatz while the church was being rebuilt. In 1978 it was elevated from parish church (German: Stadtpfarrkirche) to co-cathedral status. The Diocese of Rottenburg was subsequently renamed Rottenburg-Stuttgart to reflect the change in status.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThe organ was built in 1982 by renowned German organ builder Winfried Albiez (de). With 56 stops and 3700 pipes, it is the largest organ constructed by Albiez and one of the most important organs of the state capital. A second smaller organ in the choir was built in 2006.\n\n\n=== Specifications of the main organ ===\n\n\n=== Specification of the choir organ ===\n\n\n== Notable burials ==\nJohannes Brenz, reformer\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEgon Hopfenzitz (ed.): Kirche im Herzen der Stadt. 200 Jahre Religionsfreiheit in W\u00fcrttemberg, 200 Jahre Pfarrgemeinde St. Eberhard in Stuttgart.

Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz.

Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg.

The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium.

Ludwigsburg Palace in the nearby town of Ludwigsburg is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.\nAs a result of Stuttgart's long history of viticulture (Even today there are vineyards less than 500 m (1,640 ft) from the Main Station), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the \"St\u00e4ffele\") around the city, equivalent to approximately 20 km (12 mi) of steps. Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond. For example, Gaisburger Marsch is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart's Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.\n\nIn October 2009 the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced that the European Union was to officially recognise the pasta dish Maultaschen as a \"regional specialty\", thus marking its significance to the cultural heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.In 1993 Stuttgart hosted the International Garden Show in the suburb of Killesberg. In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the Football World Cup. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.

It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy W\u00fcrttemberg until 1806, the W\u00fcrttemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen W\u00fcrttemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart.

The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Some of its most prominent companies include Daimler AG, Porsche, Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sika \u2013 all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.\nStuttgart is home to Germany's ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nThe city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg after Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and Freiburg.

Friedrich Schiller and the city's most famous Classicist architect, Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, were among its many esteemed alumni.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nThe first Waldorf School (also known as Rudolf Steiner School) was founded here in 1919 by the director of the Waldorf Astoria tobacco factory, Emil Molt, and Austrian social thinker Rudolf Steiner, a comprehensive school following Steiner's educational principles of anthroposophy and humanistic ideals. Today, four of these schools are located in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== International School ===\nSince 1985 Stuttgart is home to the International School of Stuttgart, one of fewer than 100 schools worldwide that offer all three International Baccalaureate programs- the IB Primary Years (Early Learning to Grade 5), IB Middle Years (Grade 6 to 10), IB Diploma (grades 11\u201312). The International School of Stuttgart is accredited by both the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.\n\n\n== Media and publishing ==\nOne of the headquarters of the public S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR; Southwest Broadcasting) channels (several radio and one TV channel; regional focus on the southwestern German States of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate) is located in Stuttgart (the other ones being Baden-Baden and Mainz).

It transmits on FM on 102.3 MHz from Fernmeldeturm Frauenkopf and on AM on 1143 kHz from Hirschlanden transmitter.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFollowing the suit of other German cities such as Berlin, Cologne and Hanover, on 1 March 2008 a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) came into effect in Stuttgart with the aim of improving air quality. This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (Umweltzone), including vehicles from abroad.\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\n\nStuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a 'U' symbol, which stands for Untergrundbahn (underground rail). Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfenbahnen AG (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the Stuttgart S-Bahn, using tracks supplied by the national Deutsche Bahn AG (DB).\nA peculiarity of Stuttgart is the Zahnradbahn, a rack railway that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch. It is the only urban rack railway in Germany. Stuttgart also has a Standseilbahn, a funicular railway that operates in the Heslach area and the forest cemetery (Waldfriedhof). In Killesberg Park, on a prominent hill overlooking the city, there is the miniature railway run by diesel (and on weekends with steam).\n\n\n=== Rail links ===\n\nStuttgart is a hub in the Intercity-Express and Intercity networks of Deutsche Bahn AG (DB), with through services to most other major German cities.

The local rail networks (see above) operate underneath the terminus.Stuttgart also has its own rail freight centre with marshalling yards and a container terminal in the Obert\u00fcrkheim area of Hedelfingen.\n\n\n=== Rail: The Stuttgart 21 project ===\nAfter years of political debate and controversy, plans were approved in October 2007 to convert the existing above-ground main train station to an underground through station. The Stuttgart 21 project will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart's enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and should be completed in 2020.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Stuttgart Airport (German: Flughafen Stuttgart, IATA airport code STR), an international airport approximately 13 km (8 mi) south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns. It takes 30 minutes to reach the airport from the city center using S-Bahn lines S2 or S3. Stuttgart airport is Germany's only international airport with one runway. Despite protests and local initiatives, surveys are currently underway to assess the impact of a second runway.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Autobahn A8, that runs east\u2013west from Karlsruhe to Munich, and Autobahn A81 that runs north\u2013south from W\u00fcrzburg to Singen. The Autobahn A831 is a short spur entering the southern side of Stuttgart.\n\nBesides these Autobahns, Stuttgart is served by a large number of expressways, many of which are built to Autobahn standards, and were once intended to carry an A-number. Important expressways like B10, B14, B27 and B29 connect Stuttgart with its suburbs. Due to the hilly surroundings, there are many road tunnels in and around Stuttgart.

        "wiki": "Richard Fiedler was a German scientist who invented the modern flamethrower. This is a weapon that projects a stream of ignited liquid, usually oil. He submitted evaluation models of his Flammenwerfer to the German Army in 1901. The most significant model submitted was a man-portable device, consisting of a vertical single cylinder 4 feet (1.2 m) long, horizontally divided in two, with pressurized gas in the lower section and flammable oil in the upper section. On depressing a lever the propellant gas forced the flammable oil into and through a rubber tube and over a simple igniting wick device in a steel nozzle. The weapon projected a jet of fire and enormous clouds of smoke some 20 yards (18 m). It was a single-shot weapon - for burst firing, a new igniter section was attached each time it was used for battle or other uses of any sorts. It was first used on the western front both by the Central Powers and the Entente.\nIt was used extensively in World War II by both Allied and Axis troops.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPrior to the first world war, Fiedler studied engineering and worked as an engineer in Berlin. The development of the flame thrower resulted from his focus on nozzles for spraying liquids.Fiedler originally performed a trick called \"Brennender See\" (Burning Lake) at festivals in Berlin-Wei\u00dfensee. The trick entailed pouring a flammable liquid onto a water surface and setting it on fire. A first flamethrower patent was granted in 1901, and Fiedler turned to the German army who granted him financial support for continuing development of the device. In 1905, he presented his flamethrower to the Preu\u00dfisches Ingenieurs-Komitee (Prussian engineering committee) at the Garde-Pionier-Bataillon in Berlin and received suggestions for improving the device.\nIndependently of Fiedler, Bernhard Reddemann (1870\u20131938) had also begun developing flamethrowers, prompted by reports of kerosene pumps that the Japanese had used against bunkers in the siege of Port Arthur. Fiedler and Reddemann met for the first time in 1908 and cooperated at the onset of the first world war on further developing the flamethrower. Reddemann advanced to the rank of major of the Pioniere (pioneers), was chief of the firefighters of Breslau and Leipzig and author of monographs on firefighting. After the war, he wrote a book on the history of the flamethrower.Fiedler founded the Fiedler Flammenapparate G.m.b.H. (Fiedler Flame Devices, limited liability company), which he managed as director until 1917. His successor were to be Hauptmann (Captain) Arthur von Steynitz, Kaufmann (merchant) Arthur Bock and Kaufmann (merchant) Kurt Mayen. Fiedler was granted 11 German patents on flamethrowers, from 1901 until 1918, the last one being for an airplane flamethrower.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBenhard Reddemann: Geschichte der deutschen Flammenwerfer-Truppe.

        "wiki": "Stuttgart ( SHTUUT-gart, also US:  STU(U)T-, STOOT-, SHTOOT-; German: [\u02c8\u0283t\u028at\u0261a\u0281t] (listen); Swabian: Schduagert [\u02c8\u0292\u030ad\u0325ua\u032f\u0261\u030a\u025b\u0295d\u0325]; names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known locally as the \"Stuttgart Cauldron\". It lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Its area has a population of 634,830, making it the sixth largest city in Germany. 2.8 million people live in the city's administrative region and 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 20 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living, innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status world city in their 2014 survey., Stuttgart was one of the host cities of the official tournaments for the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nSince the 7th millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in 83 AD and built a massive castrum near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart's roots were truly laid in the 10th century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years' War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and it became the major economic, industrial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.Stuttgart is also a transport junction, and possesses the sixth-largest airport in Germany. Several major companies are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Daimler AG, and Dinkelacker.Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. This often surprises visitors who associate the city with its reputation as the \"cradle of the automobile\". The city's tourism slogan is \"Stuttgart offers more\". Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), the city unveiled a new logo and slogan in March 2008 describing itself as \"Das neue Herz Europas\" (\"The new Heart of Europe\"). For business, it describes itself as \"Where business meets the future\". In July 2010, Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants. According to Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany, \"In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.\" 40% of Stuttgart's residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nStuttgart, often nicknamed the \"Schwabenmetropole\" (English: Swabian metropolis) in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word Stuotgarten, or \"stud farm\", because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nOriginally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman Castra stativa (Cannstatt Castrum) built c. 90 AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the 3rd century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the 7th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a \"Chan Stada\" in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall's archives as \"Canstat ad Neccarum\" (German: Cannstatt-on-Neckar) in 708. The etymology of the name \"Cannstatt\" is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as condistat in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word condita (\"foundation\"), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix \"Condi-.\" Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the Civitas Aurelia G attested to in an inscription found near \u00d6hringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish *kond\u00e2ti- \"confluence\".In 950 AD, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf's hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.Stuttgart's viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year 1108 AD, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a \"Hugo de Stuokarten\". A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In 1219 AD, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in c. 1220. In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von W\u00fcrttemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden's dowry. His son, Eberhard I \"the Illustrious\", would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of W\u00fcrttemberg.\nEberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor's created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I's death in 1291 against the Emperor's men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII's death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city's defenses. The early 1320s were an important one for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the W\u00fcrttemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town's Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city's fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Treaties of N\u00fcrtingen, M\u00fcnsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.\n\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\nIn 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the W\u00fcrttembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina's by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League's conquest of W\u00fcrttemberg. W\u00fcrttemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants' War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a W\u00fcrttemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisek\u00f6nigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542\u201344, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a 2,810 feet (860 m) tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566\u201375. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch's torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today's Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.The Thirty Years' War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at N\u00f6rlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize W\u00fcrttemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy's population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 \u2013 about 57% of the population of W\u00fcrttemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city's first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas appeared outside the city's walls in 1688 during the Nine Years' War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over W\u00fcrttemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the \"Versailles of Swabia\", was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of W\u00fcrttemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.\nStuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when W\u00fcrttemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg and German Empire ===\nKing Frederick I's W\u00fcrttemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart's most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the K\u00f6nigsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year's bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the W\u00fcrttemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.\nFrom the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart's development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822\u20131830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834\u20131840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King's army.Stuttgart's literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard M\u00f6rike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubil\u00e4umss\u00e4ule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the K\u00f6nigsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart's history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untert\u00fcrkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.\nStuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile's invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile', and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering\" in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Roteb\u00fchlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.\n\n\n=== Weimar Republic ===\nAt the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of W\u00fcrttemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.\n\n\n=== Nazi Germany ===\nDue to the Nazi Party's practice of Gleichschaltung, Stuttgart's political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker \"City of the Abroad Germans\" in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.The Hotel Silber (English: Silver), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street (German: Archivstra\u00dfe) 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart's Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around W\u00fcrttemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over W\u00fcrttemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.Stuttgart, like many of Germany's major cities, was savaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city's industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to British and American bombers that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs \u2013 including 75 blockbusters \u2013 levelled Stuttgart's city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as \"The Stuttgart Crisis\" provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, from 1945 until 1952.\n\n\n=== Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ===\nThe military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.\nAn early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the 'bi-zone' (later the 'tri-zone' when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city's bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.\nThe immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberb\u00fcrgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friederich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstra\u00dfe 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett's Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg, South Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city's population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called \"Gastarbeiter,\" from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.\nIn the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the \"German Autumn\" of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive Life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the \"Todesnacht von Stammheim,\" \"Night of Death at Stammheim.\"\nThe trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 in Germany with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Mercedes-Benz Area respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.\nStuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.\n\n\n==== US Military in Stuttgart ====\nSince shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.\nIn March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurm\u00e4rker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\nIn 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"\u2014as in joint service\u2014since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about 900 feet (270 m) above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at 48\u00b047\u20320\u2033N 9\u00b011\u20320\u2033E 115 miles (185 km) to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being \"zwischen Wald und Reben\", or \"between forest and vines\" because of its viticulture and surrounding forests.\nStuttgart covers an area of 207.35 km2 (80 sq mi) and sits at elevation ranging from 207 m (679 ft) above sea level by the Neckar river to 549 m (1,801 ft) on Bernhartsh\u00f6he hill \u2013 something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf (511 m (1,677 ft)) on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the W\u00fcrttemberg (411 m (1,348 ft)) rising above the Neckar valley, and the Gr\u00fcner Heiner (395 m (1,296 ft)) at the northeast end of the city.\n\nStuttgart is one of 14 Regional centres in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi) containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition to this, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, and Ditzingen, and Gerlingen and Korntal-M\u00fcnchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) containing 5.3 million persons.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), just like the British Isles and Northern France, but it is very extreme at times. As a result of the urban heat island caused by the dense development of the city, inside its \"Cauldron\" average temperatures in the summer months regularly beat 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) from June to August and come very near in September. In the winter temperatures are quite mild, with daily means never sinking below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) even in the coldest months (January and February). In spite of the heat, there is no dry season and the city receives frequent but moderate precipitation year-round. Annually, the city receives average 718.7 mm (28.30 in) of rain (German average national annual rainfall is 700 mm (28 in)). On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F).Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, and Black Forest, Schurwald, and Swabian-Franconian Forest act as a shield from harsh weather but the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Winters last from December to March. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it has been known to last several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. The summers are warm with an average temperature of 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the hottest months of July and August. Summers last from May until September. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as \"Hagelflieger\" are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.\n\n\n== Landmarks and culture ==\n\n\n=== The inner city ===\n\nAt the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city's shopping area, Schlossgarten park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart's two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, Stuttgart's most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:\n\nThe Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534.

In neighboring Leinfelden-Echterdingen\n\n\n=== Parks, lakes, cemeteries and other places of interest ===\n \nAt the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists. Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the Green U. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens \u2013 a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.\nAt the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second Green U park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart's Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.\nBeyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final Green U park, Killesbergpark or 'H\u00f6henpark' which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.\nOn the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous 'Wilhelma', Germany's only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of W\u00fcrttemberg. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.\nOther parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universit\u00e4t Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandsh\u00f6he hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Wei\u00dfenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a 'tea house' and the 'marble room' and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at 511 metres (1,677 ft) the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300\u2013400 years old).\n\nThere are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [M\u00fchlhausen].\nThere are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a 3 km (1.9 mi) trio made up of the B\u00e4rensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.\nIn the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two 'Feuersee's (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.\nCemeteries in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an infirmary graveyard last used in 1951\nThe Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to S\u00fcdheimer Platz by funicular railway\nThe Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium. Established in 1873 it was extended to include Jewish graves in 1874 and also now houses the Russian Orthodox Church of Alexander Nevsky\nThe Uff-Kirchhof cemetery in Bad Cannstatt which stands at the crossroads of two ancient Roman roads and Cannstatter Hauptfriedhof, the largest graveyard in Stuttgart which has been used as a Muslim burial ground since 1985.The city boasts the largest mineral water deposits in Europe after Budapest, with over 250 springs within the urban area.\n\n\n=== Culture and events ===\n\nStuttgart is known for its rich cultural heritage, in particular its State Theatre (Staatstheater) and State Gallery (Staatsgalerie). The Staatstheater is home to the State opera and three smaller theatres. It regularly stages opera, ballet and theatre productions as well as concerts. The Staatstheater was named Germany/Austria/Switzerland \"Theatre of the year\" in 2006; the Stuttgart Opera has won the 'Opera of the year' award six times. Stuttgart Ballet is connected to names like John Cranko and Marcia Hayd\u00e9e.\nStuttgart is also home to one of Germany's most prestigious symphony orchestras, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra, with famous English conductor Sir Roger Norrington, who developed a distinct sound of that orchestra, known as the Stuttgart Sound. They mostly perform in the Liederhalle concert hall.\nThe city offers two Broadway-style musical theaters, the Apollo and the Palladium Theater (each approx. 1800 seats). Ludwigsburg Palace in the nearby town of Ludwigsburg is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.\nAs a result of Stuttgart's long history of viticulture (Even today there are vineyards less than 500 m (1,640 ft) from the Main Station), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the \"St\u00e4ffele\") around the city, equivalent to approximately 20 km (12 mi) of steps. Later, in the early 19th Century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the St\u00e4ffele were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.\nStuttgart's Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond. For example, Gaisburger Marsch is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart's Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.\n\nIn October 2009 the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced that the European Union was to officially recognise the pasta dish Maultaschen as a \"regional specialty\", thus marking its significance to the cultural heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.In 1993 Stuttgart hosted the International Garden Show in the suburb of Killesberg. In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the Football World Cup. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. In 2008 it was host to the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships. In 2015 Stuttgart hosted the Protestant Kirchentag (Chuchfestival)\nRegular events that take place in Stuttgart:\n\nThe world-famous annual 'Volksfest', originally a traditional agricultural fair which now also hosts beer tents and a French village and is second in size only to the Oktoberfest in Munich. There is also a Spring festival on the same grounds in April of each year.\nWith more than 3.6 million visitors in 2007 and more than 200 stands, Stuttgart's Christmas Market, running from late November to 23 December, is the largest and one of the oldest traditional Christmas markets in Europe. It is especially renowned for its abundant decorations and takes place in the four weeks leading up to Christmas.\nThe Fish Market (Hamburger Fischmarkt, late July) with fresh fish, other food and beer from Hamburg.\nThe Summer Festival (Stuttgart Sommerfest, usually in early August) with shows, music, children's entertainment and local cuisine in Schlossplatz, Stuttgart and adjacent parks\nThe Lantern Festival (Lichterfest, early July) in Killesberg park with its famous firework display and fairground attractions\nThe Wine Village (Weindorf, late August/early September) \u2013 vintages are sold at this event held at Schillerplatz and Marktplatz (Market Square)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nStuttgart is home to five of the eleven state museums in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The foremost of these is the Old State Gallery (opened in 1843, extended in 1984) which holds art dating from the 14th to 19th century including works by Rubens, Rembrandt, Monet, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne and Beuys. Next door to the Old State Gallery is the New State Gallery (1980) with its controversial modern architecture. Among others, this gallery houses works from Max Beckmann, Dal\u00ed, Matisse, Mir\u00f3, Picasso, Klee, Chagall and Kandinsky.\nThe Old Castle is also home to the State Museum of W\u00fcrttemberg which was founded in 1862 by William I of W\u00fcrttemberg. The museum traces the rich history of W\u00fcrttemberg with many artifacts from its dukes, counts and kings, as well as earlier remnants dating back to the Stone Age. On the Karlsplatz side of the Old Castle is a museum dedicated to the memory of Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, former resident of Stuttgart who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944.\n\nOther leading museums in Stuttgart include:\n\nThe History Museum (Haus der Geschichte, 1987), examining local history, finds, the conflict between modern society and its cultural history\nState Museum of Natural History Stuttgart (SMNS) in Park Rosenstein housed in Castle Rosenstein (with an emphasis on biology and natural history) and L\u00f6wentor Museum (paleontology and geology, home of the Steinheim skull and many unique fossils from the triassic, jurassic and tertiary periods)\nThe Mercedes-Benz Museum (1936, moved in 2006), now the most visited museum in Stuttgart (440,000 visits per year).

The Stuttgart-based Pentecostal Gospel Forum is the largest place of worship (megachurch) in Germany. It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about W\u00fcrttemberg, called W\u00fcrttembergica. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, making it an archive library.\nThe Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart . It forms the center of the library system of the University, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the University and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area \u2013 such as the University of Hohenheim Library \u2013 it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).\nThe Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy W\u00fcrttemberg until 1806, the W\u00fcrttemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen W\u00fcrttemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart. The archived material is in principle open to the public and can be consulted in the reading room in Bellingweg 21 in Bad Cannstatt.\nThe Landeskirchliche Archives preserve the stocks of the W\u00fcrttemberg church leaders and of other ecclesial bodies and institutions: the ducal and royal W\u00fcrttemberg consistory, the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, deanery and parish archives, educational institutions, the works and associations as well as estates and collections. It also has the microfilms of all church books (especially baptism, marriage, and family Death's Register) in the area of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe \"Archive instigator\" is dedicated to the dead of the city. Since 2005, the instigators are working on a memoir about \"The dead town\". So far, about 5,000 names of victims of the regime of National Socialism have been acquired.\nThere are two large tours that are available to visitors to Stuttgart. The first is the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (also called the CityTour Stuttgart), lasting from 10 AM to 4 PM that takes visitors around the city. The other is the Neckar-K\u00e4pt'n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Stuttgart declined steadily between 1960 (637,539) and 2000 (586,978). Then low levels of unemployment and attractive secondary education opportunities led to renewed population growth, fuelled especially by young adults from the former East Germany. For the first time in decades, in 2006 there were also more births in the city than deaths. In April 2008 there were 590,720 inhabitants in the city.\n\n\n=== Immigrants ===\nMore than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the \"Gastarbeiter\" program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, 40% of the city's population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2006 this had reduced to 21.7%. The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (22,025), Greeks (14,341), Italians (13,978), Croats (12,985), Serbs (11,547) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, and Austria. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time W\u00fcrttemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\nUnemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 Nov and 9 Feb respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).\n\n\n=== Crime rates ===\nStuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nStuttgart's current B\u00fcrgermeister (mayor) is Fritz Kuhn of the centre-left Alliance '90/The Greens party (German Green party).\n\n\n=== City government past and present ===\nWhen Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or 'Stadtdirektor'. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or 'Schulthei\u00df'. Since 1930 the title of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of Lord Mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other W\u00fcrttemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.\nAt the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).\nAs the capital of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state departments.\nIn June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the main reason for the Greens' victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.\n\n\n=== City districts ===\nThe city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts \u2013 five \"inner\" districts and 18 \"outer\" districts. Each district has a council headed by a District Director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.\n\n\n=== Recent election results ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Some of its most prominent companies include Daimler AG, Porsche, Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sika \u2013 all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.\nStuttgart is home to Germany's ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed Mittelstand), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.\nStuttgart has the highest general standard of prosperity of any city in Germany. Its nominal GDP per capita is \u20ac57,100 and GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is \u20ac55,400. Total GDP of Stuttgart is \u20ac33.9 billion, of which service sector contributes around 65.3%, industry 34.5%, and agriculture 0.2%.\n\n\n=== The cradle of the automobile ===\nThe automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the 'cradle of the automobile'. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Science and research and development ===\nThe region currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. Almost 45% of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scientists involved in R&D are based directly in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&D costs are invested in the Stuttgart Region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).\n\n\n=== Financial services ===\nThe Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).\n\n\n=== A history of wine and beer ===\nStuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untert\u00fcrkheim.\nWine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from 'Monk Ulrich'. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart's leading source of income well into the 19th century.\nStuttgart is still one of Germany's largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany's fourth largest wine region, the W\u00fcrttemberg wine growing area which covers 11,522 hectares (28,470 acres) and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German Wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival ('Weindorf').\nStuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbr\u00e4u, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Br\u00e4u.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin.\nThe city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany's second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nThe city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg after Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and Freiburg. Founded in 1829, it was a Technische Hochschule (\"Technical University\") until 1967, when it was renamed to \"university\". Its campus for social sciences and architecture is located in the city centre, near the main train station, while the natural science campus is in the southwestern city district of Vaihingen. Historically, it has been especially renowned for its faculty of architecture (Stuttgarter Schule). Today, its main focus is on engineering and other technical subjects.\nUniversity of Hohenheim, founded in 1818 as an academy for agricultural science and forestry. While these subjects are still taught there today, its other focus today is on business administration. It is located in Hohenheim quarter of the southern city district of Plieningen.\nState University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart, founded in 1857, located in the city center, next to the Neue Staatsgalerie.\nState Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart, one of the biggest art colleges in Germany, founded in 1761, located in the Killesberg quarter of the northern city district Stuttgart-Nord.\nStuttgart Media University (Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart), founded in 2001 as a university of applied sciences, a merger of the former College of Printing and Publishing and the College of Librarianship, located in Vaihingen.\nStuttgart Technology University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule f\u00fcr Technik Stuttgart), founded in 1832 as a college for craftsmanship, university of applied sciences since 1971, located in the city center, near the University of Stuttgart's city-center campus.\nUniversity of Cooperative Education Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, founded in 1974, with a focus on practical experience, subjects are business, technology and social work.Historically, an elite military academy existed in Stuttgart in the late 18th century (1770\u20131794), the Hohe Karlsschule, at Solitude Castle. Friedrich Schiller and the city's most famous Classicist architect, Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, were among its many esteemed alumni.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\nThe first Waldorf School (also known as Rudolf Steiner School) was founded here in 1919 by the director of the Waldorf Astoria tobacco factory, Emil Molt, and Austrian social thinker Rudolf Steiner, a comprehensive school following Steiner's educational principles of anthroposophy and humanistic ideals. Today, four of these schools are located in Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== International School ===\nSince 1985 Stuttgart is home to the International School of Stuttgart, one of fewer than 100 schools worldwide that offer all three International Baccalaureate programs- the IB Primary Years (Early Learning to Grade 5), IB Middle Years (Grade 6 to 10), IB Diploma (grades 11\u201312). The International School of Stuttgart is accredited by both the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.\n\n\n== Media and publishing ==\nOne of the headquarters of the public S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR; Southwest Broadcasting) channels (several radio and one TV channel; regional focus on the southwestern German States of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate) is located in Stuttgart (the other ones being Baden-Baden and Mainz). It also has a Landesmedienzentrum, a State media center.\nFurthermore, the city is a significant centre of publishing and specialist printing, with renowned houses such as Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, Ernst Klett Verlag (schoolbooks), Kohlhammer Verlag, Metzler Verlag and Motor Presse having their head offices there. The Reclam Verlag is located in nearby Ditzingen.\nThe newspapers Stuttgarter Zeitung (StZ; regional, with significant supra-regional, national and international sections) and Stuttgarter Nachrichten (StN; regional) are published here as well as a number of smaller, local papers such as Cannstatter Zeitung.\nAs is the case wherever the US military is stationed, there is an American Forces Network (AFN) station. It transmits on FM on 102.3 MHz from Fernmeldeturm Frauenkopf and on AM on 1143 kHz from Hirschlanden transmitter.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFollowing the suit of other German cities such as Berlin, Cologne and Hanover, on 1 March 2008 a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) came into effect in Stuttgart with the aim of improving air quality. This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart 'Environmental zone' (Umweltzone), including vehicles from abroad.\n\n\n=== Local transport ===\n\nStuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a 'U' symbol, which stands for Untergrundbahn (underground rail). Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the Stuttgarter Stra\u00dfenbahnen AG (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the Stuttgart S-Bahn, using tracks supplied by the national Deutsche Bahn AG (DB).\nA peculiarity of Stuttgart is the Zahnradbahn, a rack railway that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch. It is the only urban rack railway in Germany. Stuttgart also has a Standseilbahn, a funicular railway that operates in the Heslach area and the forest cemetery (Waldfriedhof). In Killesberg Park, on a prominent hill overlooking the city, there is the miniature railway run by diesel (and on weekends with steam).\n\n\n=== Rail links ===\n\nStuttgart is a hub in the Intercity-Express and Intercity networks of Deutsche Bahn AG (DB), with through services to most other major German cities. It also operates international services to Strasbourg, Vienna, Z\u00fcrich and Paris (five times a day, journey time 3 hours 11 minutes).Long-distance trains stop at Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, the city's main line terminus, which is also used by Interregio-Express, Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains for services to stations in the Stuttgart metropolitan area. The local rail networks (see above) operate underneath the terminus.Stuttgart also has its own rail freight centre with marshalling yards and a container terminal in the Obert\u00fcrkheim area of Hedelfingen.\n\n\n=== Rail: The Stuttgart 21 project ===\nAfter years of political debate and controversy, plans were approved in October 2007 to convert the existing above-ground main train station to an underground through station. The Stuttgart 21 project will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart's enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and should be completed in 2020.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Stuttgart Airport (German: Flughafen Stuttgart, IATA airport code STR), an international airport approximately 13 km (8 mi) south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns. It takes 30 minutes to reach the airport from the city center using S-Bahn lines S2 or S3. Stuttgart airport is Germany's only international airport with one runway. Despite protests and local initiatives, surveys are currently underway to assess the impact of a second runway.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\nStuttgart is served by Autobahn A8, that runs east\u2013west from Karlsruhe to Munich, and Autobahn A81 that runs north\u2013south from W\u00fcrzburg to Singen. The Autobahn A831 is a short spur entering the southern side of Stuttgart.\n\nBesides these Autobahns, Stuttgart is served by a large number of expressways, many of which are built to Autobahn standards, and were once intended to carry an A-number. Important expressways like B10, B14, B27 and B29 connect Stuttgart with its suburbs. Due to the hilly surroundings, there are many road tunnels in and around Stuttgart. There are also a number of road tunnels under intersections in the center of Stuttgart.\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\nStuttgart has an inland port in Hedelfingen on the Neckar.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nAs in the rest of Germany, football is the most popular sport in Stuttgart which is home to 'The Reds' and 'The Blues'.

          "The Public Library was beautiful and very efficient for everyone! This is a MUST SEE! Go up to the 8th floor and have a drink and snack and then go up to the rooftop terrace to view the city. When I say efficient, you drop off your books at a mechanical sorting and restocking",
          "we went to see this as it was on the top 10 things to see and I can see why its very impressive. there are complementary lockers so you don't have to wander round with any bags or coats you may have on the top floor there is a lovely little caf\u00e9 that is very reasonably priced",

          "Woah, what a library. From the outside it looks like something a first year architect student would draw. And the surroundings are typically new brutal architecture. A big shopping mall of the usual kind. But when you go inside!!! First thing is the central piece on ground",
          "A temple for those you love anything written down. Beautifully arranged library that just fun to discover around! I went there in together with my girlfriend, left the coats in the lockers downstairs (free of charge- you would just probably need a 1-eur coin to lock the locker",

          "I love libraries but not this one... It is a modern, cold, empty and lifeless building. One elevator serves the entire facility so one is better off taking the steps... up and up and up. Obviously, this is a very personal opinion; I think of libraries as a warm, cozy place and",
